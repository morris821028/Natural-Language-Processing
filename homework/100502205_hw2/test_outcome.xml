  <Text category="music">Forget the fact that despite the grumbling
  about today's "music" too many people just swallow and digest the
  slop record companies throw at them, "Hollaback Girl" is the
  absolute DUMBEST "song" I've ever had the displeasure to hear.
  There are two main parts to this travesty: 1. Where she says
  "That's my sh**" no less than a million times, and 2. She
  demonstrates that she's hooked on phonics by being kind enough to
  spell bananas for the rest of us. If this is supposed to be rap,
  Stefani failed miserably. If it's supposed to be dance, again,
  she failed miserably. To be honest, I don't know what the hell
  this is supposed to be because it sure isn't music. The fact that
  it was Number One for so long proves that perhaps people don't
  have any requirements for their ears. - Donna Di Giacom</Text>
  <Text category="health">Printed all over the box are the words "with
  infrared heat". The instructions state that you must add warm
  water to the machine before you start, and the infrared mechanism
  is supposed to maintain the water's warm temperatures. This
  wouldn't be the case. The water cools in a matter of minutes
  after turning the bubbles and massage functions on. Turning on
  the infrared light on top of the machine looks nice, but does
  nothing at all to keep the water warm.</Text>
  <Text category="music">I just finished seeing the movie and loved the
  song at the end and immediately started looking up amazon for
  this song. Thanks to Melania for pointing out the song title at
  the end. I realize this CD is just a soundtrack, but typically
  most soundtracks also include the ending songs. It is just plain
  dumb not to include the best music in this CD. MY VOTE - DO NOT
  BUY THIS CD. The soundtrack is all pretty generic stuff. BUT GET
  THE ENDING TITLE SONG IF YOU CAN - It's great.</Text>
  <Text category="book">A useful book that provides a good summary
  comparing differing Accounting Standards and approaches between
  countries. However, it is not worth the price. It is supposedly
  written for later year undergraduate and masters accounting
  students. It is more suitable for general second year accounting
  students. Plus, as I am working with a multinational European
  bank in Japan, the book is, rapidly becoming, out of date. There
  is none of the simply but incisive commentary which can be found
  in other books about the differences and outcomes of general
  accounting principals drawn from different countries</Text>
  <Text category="music">I felt like I was taking a piss on myself the
  whole time I listened to this album. What happened to the 40
  water of the old days that used to rap with spice 1, 2pac, and mc
  breed? This clone of 40 raps with the likes of Lil jon (wack as
  hell), washed up 80 year old too short, and a bunch of losers I
  have never heard of. The album only gets props because eightball
  and mjg are on the album and ugk. And they almost played
  themselves by appearing on this god awful so called "album". E-40
  has fallen into this commercial west coast version of crunk
  called "hyphy" in attempts to breathe life into his lifeless
  career. The album has some decent beats on it but there is no
  kind of lyrical content to be found anywhere. E-40 wouldn't know
  lyrical content if I slapped him with a Krs-One cd. This cd is
  wack simple and plain, Pee-40 is a beat waster, and he needs to
  find the nearest car wash and start drying off cars!!</Text>

  <Text category="music">I wanted to like BROTHERHOOD, for the simple
  reason that nearly every New Order fan this side of the galaxy
  has dismissed it, usually with a faint whiff of snobbery (or at
  least apathy). Turns out they were right: BROTHERHOOD is half an
  album. Most of its nine songs feel unfinished, as if the band
  wanted to cash in on the success of their 1985 smash LOW-LIFE and
  didn't care about the end result. BROTHERHOOD is a rush job,
  plain and simple, but there are still glimmers of hope within
  this bare-bones effort. "As It Is When It Was" overcomes the
  album's overall muddy production by dint of being mostly
  acoustic, and the melody is quite lovely. "All Day Long", the
  emotional centerpiece of the album by default, is an intelligent
  (if half-hearted) protest against child abuse. While "Angel Dust"
  lacks a decent hook, its subtly danceable beat and effective
  synth noodlings will at least briefly hold your interest. And the
  toss-off "Every Little Counts" has a charming sense of humor that
  is too often lacking in New Order's work. The most popular song
  on BROTHERHOOD is, of course, "Bizarre Love Triangle". So good it
  seems to belong to a different album entirely, "Bizarre Love
  Triangle" is truly New Order's masterpiece. The solid beat, slick
  sequencer work, and gorgeous melody showcase the band at their
  best: catchy, danceable, and downright euphoric. (Imagine how
  well it would have fit on LOW-LIFE.) Sadly, the rest of
  BROTHERHOOD is unremarkable. The album's production neatly mixes
  rock with electronic flourishes, which has become New Order's
  signature sound, but the songwriting doesn't measure up. Buy the
  album if you're a trainspotter, but casual New Order fans would
  be better off picking up LOW-LIFE or 1983's POWER, CORRUPTION AND
  LIES. This one is just a footnote.</Text>

  <Text category="toys_games">The pieces of this toy (the outfits, etc.) all
  ripped when we pulled them off the starter sheet. Also, the
  pieces are too little and get easily lost when played with and
  the outfits are uncolorful and depressing. In general, this toy
  is hokey and cheap. I recommend Melissa and Doug's Magnetic
  Dress-Up and/or Magnetic Princess Dress-Up. All the pieces are
  wooden and are large enough to keep together. Also, the outfits
  are colorful and beautiful and they come in nice wooden boxes
  with lids so that a child can keep things organized.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I could barely get through
  the...um...er...reimagination...of the childern's classic - while
  the set design and special FX are state of the art, as usual for
  a Tim Burton film, the actual movie is hard to watch. Why? Depp's
  "performance" is chock full of ticks and mannerisms, off-putting,
  flat, self-absorbed, and finally, one-note. Rather than the
  quirky fun of the original 1972 Gene Wilder version, Burton's
  film is more horror than fantasy, often casually cruel and
  sadistic to the point of being far from family fare. While
  deliberate on Burton's part, that doesn't make the final product
  any more watchable. It's one grim, dismal, downward spiral slog.
  Not much holidday fun, huh? As with most of Burton's other big,
  expensive failures, he knows how to CREATE a convincing world,
  but has no clue how to POPULATE it with characters and situations
  we identify with and/or could care less about. The final result
  is a film that's like a fragile, hermetically sealed curio on the
  shelf - nice to look at from afar, but hard to get attached to,
  much less involved with. What a waste of millions of studio
  $$$</Text>
  <Text category="health">Bought this little cooler for the back of our
  ATW wagon to make it easier to haul snacks and juice around the

  the wood railings well, but this a totally soft-sided cooler with
  no frame or supports, so if there is anything in it, the cooler
  does not hold it's sqaure shape when hanging on the back of the
  wagon. Looks terrible and I would have been better just rigging
  up a mini igloo with bungees or somethin</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I could not force myself to watch this film in
  its entirety. I think I made it about 45 minutes in. Despite many
  fine actors, esp. the always interesting Jeff Bridges, who brings
  a layered sadness to many of his roles, I simply could not
  connect and did not care about these people. It was this huge
  budget American movie shorthand: we're supposed to care because
  we've been given a snippit of a scene that reminds us of
  something else, but it just doesn't work for me. If I don't care
  this far into the movie, it just won't happen. Visually
  beautiful, and sky high production values on costumes and sets,
  it is wasted in these disjointed storytelling. Whoever cast the
  extras has wonderful faces, which the cinematographer and editor
  took full advantage of, but why don't we get faces like that in
  the major characters. Of course Chris Cooper has that kind of
  face, but many others (esp. all the "size 2 women" in the
  supporting roles)seem to have stepped out of a commercial. The
  Chicago tribune called this film "sleek and beautiful." I will
  completely agree with that, but so are music videos. I kept
  asking myself, what is wrong, what is misfiring? I really wanted
  to like it. Some of it is the short-hand story telling, but the
  look was almost too pretty. When the cinematography is this
  gorgeous, you want and need to linger on something smaller and
  deeper, or really take all the time you need to connect with
  something bigger -a mini-series. Ultimately, I began wondering if
  the original length was much longer, and it was cut down so much
  that it became fractured, and if that is the case, my apologies
  to the director. This is the kind of film that makes me ponder,
  what is it that European film-makers "get" that we lose in our
  big budget studio films? Is the system itself hurting some films,
  by sanitizing and conforming them, when they need to stick out
  like an unruly horse's nose at the starting gate? Very beautiful,
  but no connection, and not satisfying... well, that's a lot of
  things in Hollywood in a nutshell, isn't it? There are lots of
  special features on this DVD, but if I can't sit through the
  film, I don't care about the extras. So glad I borrowed this
  instead of buying it! I hear the book is something
  wonderful...</Text>
  <Text category="book">This entire book reads like an 8th-Grade
  Research paper. From an uncountable amount of grammatical and
  spelling errors to numerous repeated sentences (literally quotes
  retyped word for word, pages apart), it's difficult not to get
  irritated while reading this. The information on Weezer is great,
  but often times the author veers away from focusing on the band
  and gives too much information on things that even the most
  obsessed fan won't care about. Unfortunately, this appears to be
  the only book on Weezer out right now, so if you want to learn
  more about the band in book form this is all you've got. I
  suggest just browsing around their official website, because it's
  obvious that's where the author got quite a bit of his
  information. Don't waste your money</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My four year old picked this toy out with a
  gift certificate given to him by his grandmother. He already had
  pirate sets made by Playmobil, but this looked like an
  interesting addition to the sets. Well, set up took nearly an
  hour for his very mechanically able father, and almost as soon as
  he began to play with it, pieces fell apart. NOTE: he is NOT a
  careless child, nor is he rough with toys. But this toy doesn't
  stand up to even the most basic four year old play. After he had
  had it up without playing with it for six months, we finally just
  boxed it. We found all the parts and sold it for five dollars at
  a garage sale. I just hope those people don't come back to
  reclaim their money. Save yourself the pain and frustration and
  buy Playmobil's Pirate Lagoon -- this is just a cheap
  knockoff</Text>
  <Text category="book">Need I say more than the above title suggests?
  Okay, so the upside of this book is that it has important life
  lessons and epiphanies from the voice of experience. There are
  some touching moments in this book, but even then there is still
  something the author is lacking. I saw the movie when it was in
  theatres and I have just finished reading the book. I liked the
  movie soooooooooo much better than the book. The movie was funny,
  entertaining, touching, personal, and sad at times. The book did
  not captivate me at all. I had trouble staying focused.
  Considering Beverly Donofrio's credentials--a bachelor's degree
  in English from Wesleyan University and a master of fine arts in
  creative writing--her quality of writing is very poor. Her
  quality of writing is more like someone who has only a highschool
  education, if even that. And not to go off topic, but since
  Donofrio has a master of fine arts in creative writing from a top
  notch school like Columbia U, then why doesn't she write about
  something else besides her getting pregnant in highschool and how
  that has changed her life? I mean, after all, the MFA is in
  creative writing, meaning she should be more creative rather than
  just write autobiographies all the time. She has only wrote 2
  books--Riding in Cars With Boys, and Looking For Mary, both about
  her getting pregnant at a young age. If you liked the movie, just
  leave it at that. Don't bother reading the book unless you enjoy
  getting disappointed. And if you're interested in a novel or
  autobiography about teen pregnancy, then go to the local library.
  Don't get this one. There's other novels covering the same
  subject that are far superior to this one.</Text>

  <Text category="book">After reading the delightful Charlie and the
  Chocolate Factory, this sequel was an absolute let-down. The
  novel begins with the great Glass Elevator breaking through the
  ceiling of Charlie's (formerly Wonka's) chocolate factory and
  rocketing into orbit around the Earth. While beyond the reaches
  of Earth's atmosphere, our heroes---Charlie, Grandpa Joe, and Mr.
  Wonka---must deal with the malleable and voracious Vermicious
  Knids (pronounced "K'Nids"), aliens which resemble
  unfrighteningly hostile figs or turds with eyes. Far worse than
  these beasties, though, are the insufferable old folks whose
  twenty-year stint in their shared bed has made them less than
  useless. Charlie, Joe, and Wonka, with no help from Charlie's
  folks or other grandparents, save themselves and a US spacecraft
  from the clutches of the Knids and return to the Chocolate
  Factory, where the old timers stupidly overdose on youth pills,
  returning them to infancy or beyond. Charlie and Wonka race
  around trying to help these ancient parasites, who respond to
  this assistance with the thanklessness the reader comes to expect
  from these oldsters. At the end of the novel, the geriatric
  brigade finally leaves the bed when they have a chance to meet
  the President. In short, these three are the most tedious,
  spiteful, unredeemable characters I've come across in children's
  literature and I hoped that they would be eaten by the Knids or
  the Gnoolies or even the Oompa-Loompas as I read this book. As it
  is, they (unlike the awful kids in the Chocolate Factory) learn
  no lessons and persist in their curmudgeonly parasitism from the
  first page to the last. Their presence throughout the novel
  rendered it a chore, rather than a joy, to read.</Text>

  <Text category="health">I bought this cushion because I had to move
  from California to New York and expected the drive to be torture
  on my back. I researched these types of cushions and decided to
  get this one because it has a lot of motors compared to cheaper
  units, and because I had recently bought a Mogu pillow and really
  liked the soft feel of it--this cushion has "Sqush," which has a
  similar feel.The cushion has a middle portion of Sqush which is
  concentrated into 3 "lumps"--at your shoulders, lower back, and
  under the front part of your thighs, near your knees. The lumps
  are soft and squishy and are covered in a spandex-like material.
  The rest of the cushion feels like fleece.When I first plugged it
  in, I was immediately disappointed in the weakness of the wimpy
  motors. Even at the highest intensity (I never even bother with
  the lower two), it felt like nothing more that a moderate
  vibration--definitely not enough to un-knot an aching back. The
  pre-set programs are fine but I rarely use them. It comes with
  straps but I had a hard time trying to install it in my car
  because the instructions were non-existent and it wasn't
  intuitive at all. I ended up just attaching them to some hardware
  on the underside of the chair, which worked well.I can't decide
  if the cushion made the drive any more bearable. The lower back
  cushioning filled my lumbar region fine but the shoulder padding
  must be too thick because it pushed my shoulders forward and
  forced me into a slight hunched position which strained my back
  and made it hurt. The thigh cushioning made it slightly difficult
  to slide into the seat because it effectively raises the level of
  the seat (my car doesn't have fancy seat controls) and I had to
  wedge myself into the seat. The massaging feature was helpful
  because it was a fun thing to do on a boring drive and it helped
  a little to keep the circulation going, but it simply wasn't
  powerful enough to be really effective. The worse thing is that
  the thigh motor DIED only a few hours into my trip!! It has a 2
  year warranty, but you have to pay a $5 "handling" fee! I'm mad
  at myself for throwing away the box because if I hadn't, I'd
  return it to Amazon and wash my hands of it.Overall, this cushion
  is underpowered, unreliable, and not as orthopedically correct as
  it should be. It is definitely not worth the outrageous price. I
  regret not buying a simple lumbar cushion instead. I wish I had
  saved my money for Homedic's highly rated Shiatsu seat cushion
  instead, although I'm somewhat leary of their product reliability

  <Text category="book">David Fromkin's "Peace to End All Peace" is
  simultaneously a comprehensive and very flawed work. Many of the
  reasons for it being one can be found in the other. Fromkin
  attempts to examine how the modern Middle East (extending as far
  as Afghanistan and some sections of Central Asia) was created
  during and after the First World War. Obviously, in order to do
  this, the fall of the Ottoman Empire in that war must be
  considered. This is where Fromkin's unusual methodology comes
  into play. Focusing on the European political machinations to
  resolve the "Eastern Question" in their favour, the sorry tale
  becomes one more of Churchill and TE Lawrence than of the Arabs
  and Turks who were also involved in the process. Admittedly, it
  was the Europeans who wielded the whip hand in deciding just
  where the borders were to be drawn, but reducing key figures such
  as the CUP Triumvirate in the dying Ottoman Empire (and Kemal
  Ataturk in Turkey immediately thereafter) to the status of
  supporting players ultimately skews the focus of the book too
  much. Never let it be said that this is a simple story to retell.
  A complex web of national and personal political interests in
  both Europe and the Middle East combined to make the region what
  it is today, and any study of all of these will be faced with the
  need for convoluted explanations. The problem that Fromkin has,
  however, is that he does not make these very well at all. The
  story is told in a roughly chronological manner, which means that
  we jump from place to place and meet a bewildering array of
  characters. Ultimately, the only real result is confusion on the
  part of the reader, who is constantly flipping backwards to see
  who the latest figure to make an appearance actually is.
  Additionally, Fromkin frequently confuses his readers with
  references to geographical features which are not well-shown on
  the maps provided. Indeed, one map (showing Enver Pasha's advance
  on Baku and his campaigns in Central Asia) is laughable in the
  extreme. The legend explains that the direction of the arrows is
  the direction of the various advances - which would be
  significantly more useful were the arrows in fact arrows, and not
  equilateral triagles. Where Fromkin does well, however, is in his
  use of purely European sources. It is perhaps unusual to say this
  of a book intending to tell the story of the modern Middle East,
  but I have considerable doubts about the depth of his research
  into the Middle Eastern aspects of the events in question. In
  terms of Europe, however, his research seems to cover the major
  bases of exactly what the key figures believed and did.
  Ultimately, "A Peace to End All Peace" is a difficult and not
  particularly rewarding work. A diplomatic history of Europe
  during the Great War can be written much better than this, and a
  history of the development of the Middle East following that
  conflict already has been (the chapters in Margaret Attwood's
  "The Peacemakers" or William Cleveland's "Modern Middle East"
  both easily outshine this)</Text>

  <Text category="book">This production is misleadingly named. Far
  from being a biography of Grand Duchess Anastasia, it is really
  the story of how the deaths of her family at the hands of Russian
  revolutionaries in 1918 spawned one of the 20th century's
  enduring mysteries -- a mystery which was given a unique lease on
  life when, among the myriad male and female claimants to be
  survivors of the imperial family, one woman began to pick up
  supporters in the 1920's among at least some people who had had
  contact with the original family. I do not fault this production
  for failing to be a real biography. After all, how much of a
  biography can one write on a 17-year-old girl whose life was
  largely one of sheltered privilege? However, I do fault this
  production for being a badly-flawed recounting of history. And I
  am not talking about the interminable debate that still rages in
  the arcane world of Romanov history buffs about whether Anna
  Anderson was really Anastasia. This work's take on the life of
  Anastasia paints a very tilted picture both of the world of the
  Romanovs, their support among their subjects, and their
  reputation among today's Russians. First, life in the inner
  sanctum of Nicholas's family was not the halcyon existence this
  production claims. Certainly the family had great wealth and huge
  staff at its disposal. But neither Nicholas nor Alexandra were
  well-suited to their roles, and they lived under the strain of
  it. They were increasingly isolated from the extended Romanov
  clan, who shared the dawning awareness of the Russian people that
  the monarchy was in serious trouble. While these forces might not
  have touched Anastasia directly, she was certainly touched by her
  brother's hemophilia and her mother's response of sinking into
  frail health, chronic emotional distress, and a religious
  mysticism that almost bordered on hysteria at times. Secondly,
  this film's portrayal of the counter-revolutionary White Army as
  determined to save their beloved tsar from captivity is just
  plain wrong. While the Whites wanted to unseat the Bolshevik
  revolution, there was virtually no support for a Romanov
  restoration among the leadership of the White Army. Nor are there
  any known attempts by the counter-revolutionary forces to rescue
  their former imperial family. In fact, one senior White military
  leader once remarked, "having seen the monarchy at close
  quarters, I have no desire to see its return." And thirdly, while
  there is a gradual rehabilitation of the last Romanov's
  reputation underway in Russia today, the notion that the murdered
  Romanovs are saints is not nearly the widespread sentiment that
  this production claims. In fact, the great masses of modern
  Russians are far more interested in making their new democracy
  work than in figuring out how to get the sainted Romanovs back on
  a throne. I do not know whether these flaws arise from some
  agenda to rehabilitate the Romanovs, whether they arise from
  sloppy research that relied too much on the fawning
  pseudo-history that plagues serious study of the Russian
  monarchy's fading years, or whether this production did not have
  access to newly-opened archives. But -- whatever the reason(s) --
  it does a disservice to the study of history by claiming to be
  history when it is, in fact, closer to a grocery-store romance

  <Text category="book">Seven Times The Sun is not for everyone. It
  could be a springboard, offering times of the day and night where
  parents might want to incorporate some kind of rituals to provide
  their children with a stable and balanced life. But the songs,

  contrived at best, cumbersome and artificial at worst. None of
  the other reviews indicated the religious or spiritual aspect of
  the book. Darian is a minister, and all of the poems and songs
  have a subtle religious bent. True, parents should teach children

  <Text category="music">I really don't want to be mean, but I find
  this album very shallow. Classical Indian music is a very

  make it palatable to simple-minded people who need westernized
  electronic and wishy-washy "world music" cliches. I don't find
  this music to be uplifting or enlightening or interesting. And
  this is not coming from a strict old fundamentalist of anything,
  I have delved deep into the avante guard, minimalism, "new
  music", eastern and western music theory, microtonal, etc. I
  would recomend jsut being a non-westernized album and getting the

  <Text category="book">If we are to draw equivalent lessons from both
  the Prague Spring and street protests in the U.S., as Kurlansky
  attempts in this book, the connection should depend on more than
  that they simply occured in the same year. The reader is owed
  specifics, yet is rewarded with little more than vague
  platitudes. Prague was a protest against a government which not
  only lacked representation and dissent, but prohibited it.
  Chicago et al were protests against decisions made by a
  representative government, however flawed, resulting from open
  debate. A bigger difference could hardly be imagined. But
  Kurlansky does see striking differences, albeit only in the
  post-1968 world. The Soviet bloc began it's decent to oblivion,
  while the capitalist West avoided the same. His disappointment in
  the latter is not hard to glean, though what manner of
  "revolution" he envisions is never rendered to specifics, likely
  for good reason. But who needs details when false equivalencies

  they were made, and they are of inferior quality. The top and
  bottom halves are loose, and have to be carefully manipulated to
  come together without a gap. The first one I got, I sent it back
  to Cross for warranty repair under their "lifetime guarantee,"
  only to receive it back unchanged telling me that it was just
  fine - and a "handling fee" attached. I was willing to believe it
  was simply an anomaly, one bad pen. So later on when some new
  colors came out, I bought two more - only to see that they have
  the same quality defect. My advice: if you want a good Cross pen,
  go to the secondhand store and buy one that was made in USA. They
  aren't making them the same anymore.</Text>

  <Text category="music">I had never heard Leonard Cohen's music but
  saw references to it frequently when looking at other
  singers/songwriters. Given his status/reputation I thought I
  should get this CD and learn what all the fuss was about. Having
  had no preconceptions, I have to say I was quite disappointed. I
  think the music has not aged well and is pretty unremarkable.
  Perhaps the style liberated others to pursue new directions but
  the work in and of itself is ho hum at best. Specific example
  that speaks volumes: listen to Cohen's singing of his
  "Hallelujah" and then listen to Jeff Buckley's cover of that song
  on "Grace" which was recorded in 1994. Sorry, Leonard, you cannot
  hold even a birthday-sized candle to Jeff Buckley's rendition of
  your own song. It is a very unflattering comparison that pretty
  much put the first and last nail in the coffin for my
  appreciation of Cohen's legacy. "Tant pis, vers le

  <Text category="dvd">Incredible does describe this movie-
  incredibly bad! This movie doesn't know what it wants to be. At
  times one can see attempts to recreate and milk the genuine rage
  and drama of "Mississippi Burning" or the anger and impunity of
  "Ghosts of Mississippi", or a hybrid of those and bits and pieces
  of other movies of this genre. At other times it looks like its
  just trying to draw from the sex appeal and cheesy interaction of
  2 of its main actors, Matthew McConaughey and Sandra Bullock. As
  a result this movie picks up the rear in that genre's list of
  movies for lack of originality, and the scattered hodge podge
  statements it tries to make. Some of my favorite actors are
  wasted, either by being given cliched dialogue, over acting, or
  being put there merely for their brand name with no script to
  support their presence. If this script is considered a great
  adaptation of a great book, then I have no interest in reading
  the book. I'm sure the idea and the premise looked good on paper.
  But the direction doesn't guide the story with any coherence or
  identity of its own. Bullock is mere cheesecake and is
  unbelievable in her role, proving she's only worthy of b-grade
  "Miss Congeniality" type crud. McConaughey over acts so much (as
  can be said for Keifer Sutherland and others) that it can be said
  he balances out the under acting of Patrick McGoohan, Kevin
  Spacey and Donald Sutherland. Samuel L. Jackson should be ashamed
  of himself of not only his worst performance ever, but also
  easily his worst choice of movies to participate in. Even the
  extras in this movie are horrible. Enough can't be said about the
  terrible direction in this movie, equating elongated facial shots
  with drama to a fault, making Sergio Leone westerns look much
  more authentic by comparison. This is not "a powerful film." It's
  a powerful attempt at using a big name cast, a brand name book
  and a capable director to use material that they know would
  easily jerk the emotions of its audience, and in doing that they
  resort to all the cliches of this genre scattering the story line
  in so many directions, culminating in an over the top, pleading
  hunk of cheese summation scene by McConaughey that wouldn't hold
  water in any real court of justice. Maybe people claim greatness
  to this movie out of guilt, or because they haven't seen quality
  comparisons and classics like "Mississippis Burning," that has
  both a great script and fabulous acting. I don't know. All I know
  is it tugs from so many hokey directions it takes the final scene
  to remind everyone how it started. Among the top of my most over
  rated movies</Text>
  <Text category="health">I really like the Crane humidifiers for
  children, my youngest daughter has been using the penguin at
  night for quite some time. It occasionally glugs but the most
  part is very quiet. So I was confident that the apple shape my
  elder daughter chose would be just as good. I was surprised when
  it arrived as the water cannister was much flatter and smaller
  than I had expected and the design of the base which controled
  the water flow was different. Still we started to use it and
  quickly discovered that it didn't detect the water level
  accurately and frequently turned itself off. This may be a fault
  with the one I received and so I have sent it back, or it may be
  a design flaw with this shape. I have just received the soccer
  ball and the base on this looks more like the penguin and the
  water cannister is more like a sphere. So although I haven't had
  chance to use it I am more hopeful of success. It is important to
  empty these humidifiers regularly and clean them, I forgot for a
  few days and was horrified at the build up of slimy stuff and the
  smell of mould in such a short time</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">A French saying goes: "The more things change,
  the more they stay the same." It appears that the "historical"
  epic film of yesteryear is still much like that of today in that
  "poetic" license is taken to the extreme in passing outright lies
  and fabrications as truth. One of the things that really turned
  my stomach watching this is D W Griffith's emphasis at least
  twice during the film that he did not intend to offend any race
  but wanted to show historical events and yet goes on to portray
  outright falsehoods as truth. Firstly, we all know that this
  Cameron dude did not start the KKK and that this organisation has
  its roots in Indiana and not South Carolina. Secondly, the KKK is
  not the defender of the South and there is no need to "purify"
  the race as is portrayed here the exact words used by D W is
  "preserve the Aryan race." Modern science, using cutting edge DNA
  research has already proved that we all come from the same
  African man about 60,000 years ago and so any racial distinctions
  are not only ethically wrong but factually wrong as well. Like it
  or not, we are all related and separated only by about 2000
  generations despite our seemingly outward physical differences
  and have a common ancestor. Some of the portrayals of Blacks as
  alcoholics and white women predators with behaviours more akin to
  monkeys I found extremely revolting and shocking and leaves me
  completely unsurprised that riots and lynchings quickly followed
  the screenings of this movie. Yes, this movie may have been the
  first feature length movie that used a number of novel techniques
  but does this excuse the content? This is not akin to an Einstein
  discovering relativity folks; every single "good" thing about
  this movie would have been "discovered/invented" with or without
  D W. eventually and very probably very soon after. Every one of
  the techniques used would have eventually been used by any of the
  later, talented directors of the time. The overall lies, attempts
  to justify racism and the murderous KKK more than make this film
  fit for the dust bin than for immortality in movie's great hall
  of fame. They say that racists are not born but bred; this is why
  I'm not at all surprised at what D W Griffith has done here. His
  father was considered a "hero" of the Confederate Army where he
  served as a Colonel. I'm sure as a bitter loser of the great war,
  he must have taught his son his belief system and how to be a
  great racist. This movie has not been preserved all that well
  with many scenes being either too bright or too dark and the
  soundtrack is too loud and it's quite irritating to have to keep
  hearing Mendelssohn's overtures over and over again. In
  conclusion, the question this movie raises is does freedom of
  expression mean it's okay to make a mockery of history to further
  a racist directors' world view? Also, do you buy the fact that
  just because this is the first movie that's longer than an hour
  mean that this should be revered for all time despite its
  extremely offensive and destructive message? Like I said before
  none of the "techniques" that this film claims to have
  "discovered" are earth-shattering discoveries that would have
  required a genius to uncover anyway. So the bottom line is we
  have here an extremely racist and hate-inducing film that caused
  a lot more damage than good; D W Griffith's legacy/mess</Text>

  <Text category="music">I've never been a fan of Metallica. I like
  Ride The Lightening, Master of Puppets, and that's it. That's the
  extent of my enjoyment with their abilities. However, if there is
  one quality I've always admired in Metallica, it is their lyrics.
  They've always had excellent lyrics in their songs, and that was
  what got me to keep buying albums. However, I can't credit them
  for any lyrics on this one. Unfortunately, we're dealing with a
  bunch of covers. Some of the songs are pretty good. The only one
  I can say I really like is Turn The Page, though Seger's original
  version is leaps and bounds ahead of it. It's got decent music,
  and the vocals aren't bad. Metallica just couldn't figure out how
  to honor a classic, and they occasionally sounded like James was
  trying to lift a thousand pounds while he sang, leading his voice
  to sound overly forced. Other songs, like Killing Time, were not
  spared on this album. Unlike with Turn The Page, Metallica didn't
  even do a halfway decent job covering this. They destroyed a
  pretty good song. And to be honest, Metallica's guitarist just
  can't compete with Sweet Savage's (Vivian Campbell??). Tuesday's
  Gone was also destroyed. It was too slow and acoustic, but not in
  the good way it was in the Skynyrd original. In this case, James'
  voice was terrible. It sounded like he was bleeding the entire
  time and trying to ignore it. That is, at least, the effect I get
  from it. Overall, if you're a die hard fan, you won't like this.
  It just doesn't have what Metallica did have for songs back with
  Ride The Lightening and Master of Puppets. If you're just looking
  for some Metallica, you might as well get this. As long as you
  are just a small fan, and not a huge one. Otherwise, this may
  come as a dissapointment</Text>
  <Text category="music">I found the vocal delivery on this CD too
  distracting to allow me to relax. The frequent hesitations and

  <Text category="music">I've owned this cd, but didn't keep it for
  very long because it's too poppy and slick for my tastes. I guess
  when about 1981 came around Billy just wanted to distance himself
  from the brilliance of his 70's style, and on this offering, he
  kind of wanted a 50's or 60's kind of sound. This stuff is just
  to slick for this hombre. He never made a solid album, after the
  release of GLASS HOUSES, in about 1980. This is the kind of stuff
  that yuppies rave about, but if you've got some integrity, you'll
  probably want to steer clear of this one, and buy anything he
  recorded in the 70's</Text>

  it was the soundtrack for the movie and not just the 10th track
  of 10 on the CD. In hindsight she should have read the entire
  panel on the CD. I guess the producers of this CD didn't think
  the rest of the music could stand on its own and so they
  deceptively packaged it this way figuring most people wouldn't
  waste time returning it. If you had it listed in the rate column,
  I would give it a negative rating instead of just the one

  there in the power metal world, and this cd sounds pretty much
  like the previous 5 albums. The only dofference is that they have
  gotten worse. I write this review to the two groups of people out
  there: The exisiting Hammerfall fans, and those trying them out
  for the first time. For already existing Hammerfall fans such as
  myslef, I strongly urge that you do not buy this cd, unless it
  goes below 3-4 dollars on amazon. For those looking to try
  Hammerfall out and get into the power metal genre for the first
  time, go ahead and get this one, because Hammerfall are by no
  means bad musicians. They can all play very well, but this cd
  lacks refinement and creativity. Start here and work your way up
  to the better Hammerfall, which you will no doubt appreciate
  more. Hammerfall keeps putting out the same album over and over

  <Text category="book">This is a good book, but most are under the
  impression that Einstein actually CREATED the content of the
  book. Einstein actually compiled the physics theories of the
  latest German and Italian physicists and wrote it as his entire
  theory. For instance, e=mc^2 was not created by Einstein, as so
  many people people. An Italian physicist came up with it. If you
  don't believe me check any encyclopedia. Einstein suceeded in
  taking everyone's work and compiling it. This was helpful to the
  world of physics. Unfortunately, this stuff is outdated, and
  Autodynamics has disproven many things that Einstein says in this
  book. When it came out it was already outdated. This was
  published in the 60s. Autodynamics disproved what is in this book
  in the 40s (45 I believe). If this was published in the 20s or

  <Text category="dvd">Well folks, looks like we may have the most
  over praised movie of the current millennium right here. ("Crash"
  comes close, but that film has a lot more detractors than this
  one, and many of those who liked it seemed to do so because they
  imagined, somehow, that it would "change the world".) My beefs
  are not the same as most of those who don't like the film: I
  don't much care that it may show an unrealistic picture of drug
  abuse, nor do I find it overly depressing. Fact is, it isn't
  depressing at all cause I didn't care. It's just boring and
  annoying, sometimes at different moments, sometimes
  simultaneously. This not a good combination. All right, here's a
  plot summary: Jared Leto, Marlon Wayans, Jennifer Connelly and
  Ellen Burstyn all do drugs, and this really messes up their
  lives. I hate to give it all away like that, but there it is. The
  fundamental flaw is this: I don't like any of these people, so
  their pain doesn't mean anything, and since that is all there is
  to this movie it absolutely fails to have any sort of effect.
  Maybe if Aronofsky had put more time in to characterization it
  would've worked, but now there just isn't anything there. As far
  as what's actually in the movie, we've got Jared Leto as a stupid
  chunkhead who has inane conversations with his equally
  chunkheaded girlfriend Jennifer Connelly, who wants to be a
  fashion designer, or something. Beyond this we've got Jared's
  mother, Ellen Burstyn, who is a weird old woman and Marlon Wayans
  as Leto's friend who deals drugs with him at times and appears
  headed towards the big leagues. I particularly love how there's
  no real attempt to make Wayans into a person. He's got one
  flashback about how he wanted to make his mom proud and that's
  it. The doubly sad fact is that he's the most likable of the
  three. He at least displays a little life. Connelly and Leto
  apparently just wandered here from a Bergman film and are so dull
  and slow that it's a wonder that the smack doesn't cause them to
  cease to exist entirely. (Well, Connelly actually does coke, I
  think, but it fails to liven her up any. Also, I actually *like*
  the Bergman films I've seen, so that's not really a fair
  comparison.) They love each other, apparently, but since I don't
  even like either of them I'm not much interested. Finally,
  Burstyn is mostly just creepy though her performance does take a
  turn for the hilarious as she goes off the deep end. Perhaps it
  wouldn't have been funny if I cared about her, but we've been
  over that... And I want you people to know that I'm not utterly
  heartless when it comes to movies. I can care about the
  characters, but none of these people did anything for me, so the
  movie's dead in the water. For good counter examples watch
  "Trainspotting", which has drug-addict characters with enough
  humor and life to be likable and interesting and "Bubba Ho-Tep",
  a film which displays the plight of the lonely elderly 50 times
  better than this film despite being a silly horror-comedy with a
  mummy in a cowboy outfit in it. On the other hand, neither of
  those movies is nearly as pretentious as "Requiem For A Dream",
  so watching them will do nothing to stroke your ego. Still, if
  that's all you want to kinda find plenty of films better than
  this one for that purpose. "Requiem For A Dream" isn't helped any
  by Darren Aronofsky's repetitive, derivative over-direction. The
  trouble is, this movie hasn't got any plot to distract you from
  how redundant the visual style is. There's nothing inherently
  wrong with any of his tactics, but they're hopelessly driven in
  to the ground, as we see fast-motion a thousand times, quick-cut
  montages a million times and plenty of wonky
  camera-attached-to-the-actor junk, and they are, again,
  impossible not to notice cause the plot sure ain't drawing me in.
  I imagine that the overdone, repeating visual style is meant as a
  representation of the endless cycle found in drug use, but that
  doesn't make it any more pleasant or entertaining to watch. The
  score suffers from the same problem as they use the same handful
  of themes over and over. Truth be told, I thought this movie was
  pretty okay for about the first half, but then it really started
  to grate on me. It became evident that no, Aronofsky wasn't going
  to introduce any new visual tricks and no, these characters
  weren't going to get any more interesting. I looked at the timer
  continuously for about the last 40 minutes of the film, and was
  so uninvolved that the supposedly horrifying conclusion where all
  the characters really get it bad was utterly ineffective. It was
  kind of uplifting, really: Now that these tedious characters have
  finally hit rock bottom I can go do something else. Now that's a
  good ending. Grade: D+ PS This is 500 reviews. I doubt if I will
  write 500 more, but who knows</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">**1/2 When it was released in 1967, "Guess
  Who's Coming to Dinner" was acclaimed as a "breakthrough" film
  for its lighthearted, yet serious, depiction of an interracial
  romance. In the years since, society has moved so far in the
  direction of acceptance of so-called "mixed marriages" that any
  remake is bound to feel, at least to some extent, superfluous and
  anachronistic. And that is exactly the case with "Guess Who," a
  2005 update whose abbreviated title is only the first of the many
  changes the filmmakers have rung on the Stanley Kramer original.
  The screenwriters' first alteration involves switching the race
  roles, so that it is now a black family having to accept a white
  male as a prospective in-law rather than the other way around.
  Bernie Mac assumes the Spencer Tracy role as the father whose
  world is turned upside down when his beloved daughter brings a
  Caucasian boyfriend (Ashton Kutcher as a white Sidney Poitier)
  home to meet the family. On the distaff side, we have Judith
  Scott taking over for Katherine Hepburn as the understanding
  mother and Zoe Saldana replacing Katherine Houghton as the
  freethinking daughter. Since interracial marriage is no longer
  the hot-button issue it once was, the filmmakers have been forced
  to inject a number of other non-race-related plot complications
  into the mix to develop and maintain the conflict and drama.
  Thus, we have Kutcher trying to hide the fact from both his
  fiance and her family that he has recently quit his high-paying
  job at a prestigious firm and that he may, in fact, be the target
  of a securities-and-exchange commission probe. Indeed, with
  Kutcher spending most of his time trying to win over his critical
  and overbearing future father-in-law, "Guess Who" feels more like
  a remake of "Meet the Parents" than of "Guess Who's Coming to
  Dinner." The real problem with "Guess Who" is that it rarely has
  the courage of its convictions. Having decided to tackle a
  relatively dicey topic, the film too often drops the issue in
  favor of scenes that wouldn't pass muster even on a third-rate
  sitcom. For every scene that is incisive and daring - i.e.
  Kutcher telling a series of black jokes at the family dinner
  table - there is another that is pure Hollywood hokum (Mac and
  Kutcher sleeping in the same bed together, Mac and Kutcher having
  a go-cart race to determine who has the higher testosterone level
  and the greater machismo, etc.). All of the performers are fine,
  especially Mac and Kutcher in the lead roles. However, they just
  haven`t been given very sophisticated material to work with here.
  "Guess Who" might have been a better film had it aimed more for
  genuine, hard-edged satire and less for lowbrow slapstick and
  predictable romantic comedy sentimentality. Still, it's been 38
  years since "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner" first shocked the
  nation with its in-your-face defiance of miscegenation laws, and
  the world has since moved on to other issues of social injustice
  and marital definition. Which is why, in the year 2005,
  "Brokeback Mountain" was a breakthrough film and "Guess Who" was

  <Text category="book">What is remarkable about this onetime
  best-selling book -- which could well be described as a
  coming-of-age-without-coming-of-age novel -- is not that
  Fitzgerald produced it when he was all of 24. Nope, the amazing
  thing here is that the same writer produced "The Great Gatsby" a
  mere five years later. "This Side of Paradise" is a mess: it is
  as uneven, affected, feebly pretentious and relentlessly immature
  as its hero, the tiresomely self-conscious young
  Minnesotan-gone-to-Princeton Amory Blaine. (One suspects, in
  fact, that had Fitzgerald abandoned his muddled third-person
  narrative altogether and rendered the work instead as Amory's
  diary the result would have been considerably more readable -- or
  the book's structural and methodological flaws considerably more
  forgivable, at least.) That the novel was a roaring success upon
  publication in 1920 -- it was to prove the most popular book, in
  terms of sales, ever produced by its author -- presumably speaks
  to the public's recognition of something new and revealing in it.
  Okay, Amory Blaine may well have been the original Jazz Age
  prototype; and the drinking and shameless smooching (etc.) that
  he and his prep school and Princeton friends indulge in at
  various points in the novel were probably, one can accept, a
  revelation to see in print (and likely a titillating one) for an
  American audience raised on McGuffy's Readers -- and ready for
  some sort of Great Departure after the Great War. Welp, here it
  comes: "On the Triangle trip Amory had come into constant contact
  with that great current American phenomenon, the `petting party.'
  None of the Victorian mothers-and most of the mothers were
  Victorian-had any idea how casually their daughters were
  accustomed to be kissed." To the reader at a remove of some
  80-plus years this is, of course, very small beer. What was
  alarming frankness in 1920 tends to read now, in the best cases
  of the Paradise narrative, as unalarming quaintness. While this
  is not exactly Fitzgerald's "fault", so to speak, it is also true
  that the use of "shocking revelations" of this type -- scandals
  specific to a place and time -- represents a risk a writer takes:
  the march of history may or may not reveal something lasting
  and/or universal in such episodes. In any event, the price the
  reader pays here, in slogging through the meandering narrative
  which surrounds Amory's adventures in quaintness during the
  nascent Roaring Twenties, is very, very high for payoffs of such
  modest proportions. I mean, come on: "For years afterward when
  Amory thought of Eleanor he seemed still to hear the wind sobbing
  around him and sending little chills into the places beside his
  heart. The night when they rode up the slope and watched the cold
  moon float through the clouds, he lost a further part of him that
  nothing could restore; and when he lost it he also lost the power
  of regretting it. Eleanor was, say, the last time evil crept
  close to Amory under the mask of beauty, the last weird mystery
  that held him with wild fascination and pounded his soul to
  flakes." Yikes. I don't care what New Generation you're talking
  about, can a flake-pounded soul really represent much of an
  innovation to anybody? (Can it represent ANYTHING to anybody?)
  There are things to like, even admire, here and there in
  Paradise. Fitzgerald gets off a few of the wonderfully
  epigrammatic lines that were to become a trademark (e.g., "They
  slipped briskly into an intimacy from which they never
  recovered." "Sometimes I wish I'd been an Englishman; American
  life is so damned dumb and stupid and healthy." "It's better to
  leave the blustering and tremulo-heroism to the middle classes;
  they do it so much better.") And the political incorrectness of
  some of the narrator's observations is, in its now-curious way,
  refreshingly, bracingly funny: "Slowly and inevitably, yet with a
  sudden surge at the last, while Amory talked and dreamed [which
  is about all Amory ever does-MHT], war rolled swiftly up the
  beach and washed the sands where Princeton played. Every night
  the gymnasium echoed as platoon after platoon swept over the
  floor and shuffled out the basketball markings. When Amory went
  to Washington the next weekend, he caught some of the spirit of
  crisis which changed to repulsion in the Pullman car coming back,
  for the berths across from him were occupied by stinking
  aliens-Greeks, he guessed, or Russians." Nothing like a little
  wretched refuse to remind you there's a war on, I always say.
  Anyway, most of the novel consists of young Amory's elaborate
  ponderings -- romantic, philosophical and egotistical -- which
  are as forgivable as they are forgettable. I've forgotten them
  already. At some level, in any case, Fitzgerald himself had to
  recognize the ridiculousness of this pompous character -- who
  was, of course, a not-very-disguised version of himself. For how
  else, if not as commendably self-deprecating irony, are we to
  take this observation? "Amory was in full stride, confident,
  nervous, and jubilant. Scurrying back to Minneapolis to see a
  girl he had known as a child seemed the interesting and romantic
  thing to do, so without compunction he wired his mother not to
  expect him, and sat in the train and thought about himself for
  thirty-six hours." In the end, in any event, one comes back to
  the initial Fitzgerald vs. Fitzgerald comparison with something
  like gaping wonder. In Paradise almost nothing works: form,
  content, narrative stance, dialogue, character development,
  pacing -- you name it, it's a problem. Yet in Gatsby, five years
  later, everything works -- everything. If there is to be a Great
  American Novel, it will have to supplant Gatsby for the honor.
  While it is hard to see how Fitzgerald got from point A to point
  B, the fact is that he did -- and without point A the journey
  could not have begun. So while "This Side of Paradise" hardly
  deserves a place in the national literary canon, it surely
  deserves our respect, and indeed our gratitude, for what it led
  to.</Text>

  <Text category="book">It's a bad idea to create a character-driven
  sci-fi when your characters are this annoying. The majority of
  Children of the Mind consists of inane dialogue between
  characters that are impossible to care about. The characters are
  so one-dimensional and predictable that you already know what
  they'll say before they say it. Peter says nothing except smart
  alecky remarks, Val spends the whole book whining loudly about
  not being a real person, Novinha is as crazy and hard-headed as
  she's been for the last two books, and Ender spouts off a bunch
  of trite, up-with-people garbage every chance he gets. Somehow,
  Card even managed to make Jane more irritating than my

  are Miro and Wang Mu, and they aren't nearly enough to save the
  story. I admit it: I only made it a little over half-way through
  Children of the Mind. I couldn't take the dialogue anymore.
  That's not to mention the ridiculous plot, which centers on two
  children warping around the universe, engaging in philosophical
  discussions with caricatures of Japanese and Polynesian culture,
  in an attempt to avert a war between species. If you're that

  <Text category="dvd">If there ever was a movie more hyped in 2005
  it was "History of Violence" On critics top ten list, everyone
  was talking about the performances of Viggo and Maria and Ed, so
  I went into it with high expectations. Honestly it wasn't
  horrible, but it wasn't worth all the worship that the Hollywood
  community and critics heaped upon it either. The story of a
  humble family man in a small town who thwarts two cold blood
  murderers, only to be visited afterwards by his past in the shape
  of Ed Harris , who in my opinion had the best performance
  overall. Ed (Mr. Fogarty) is in the Mob and seems to think that
  Viggo (Tom) is Joey Cusack a former mobster who went missing
  after killing his friends and wounding his eye and now he wants
  revenge. Tom, and his wife Edie (played by Maria Bello) have two
  children, a farmhouse, and a diner and Tom insist that he isn't
  Joey. The story goes on, dragging and dragging with tiny spots of
  violence and sex. Maria Bello has never been one of my favorite
  actresses, I think her acting ability is a natural as her blonde
  hair (evidence is in the movie) she brings the level of
  believability down and makes Viggo's performance seem like he is
  trying to make up for her lack of talent. We soon figure out that
  Tom is indeed Joey and after we say goodbye to Ed Harris's
  character (of which I was just disappointed to see, c'mon he was
  awesome!) Tom/Joey goes to see his brother, Richie (William Hurt)
  to make amends for disappearing, and soon realizes that Richie
  wants him dead. So more killing, more blood, and tom/joey is
  finally free of his past, if his family would take him back. Of
  course they do, really, his redemption is yawn worthy set around
  a dinner table (his daughter sets a place for him...) and the
  movie is over. There was no Aha moment, the action wasn't
  anything new, the story was predictable and the setting was "been
  there done that". Viggo is an amazing actor, and if there had
  been a better script he might have come across as more tortured
  and the Tom/Joey duality could have come off as truly horrific to
  change back into, the shift of reality was barely noticeable.
  Maria Bello, needs to stop being cast in these dramatic roles
  where she is some tough, sexy, stringy haired ball breaker who is
  kinda motherly, it doesn't work for her, she cannot pull it off.
  So I don't recommend this movie, its slow, its disappointing and
  its not all it was cracked up to be</Text>

  <Text category="book">When I found out Francis Collins has written a
  book about his faith, I ordered it the same day. After all, we
  seemed to be following the same path. I earned a PhD in Molecular
  Biology in 1981 and had several `firsts' in the area of gene
  cloning. Then I found Christ as a 40-year-old. My transition was
  from a semi-serious Jew to a Materialist to a serious Christian.
  Hearing about Dr. Collins' spiritual walk had me intrigued. His
  book should be entitled "a Politician Presents Evidence for
  Belief". It is a completely uncritical view of the last twenty
  years of biological research. The Human Genome Project is
  elevated to status of "bridge to a momentous new era". Hogwash.
  Hype is the term I would use. The Dept. of Energy was duped into
  footing the bill because the National Institutes of Health saw it
  as a waste of resources. The author couldn't make a better case
  for the payoff than to show humans have more `junk DNA' than
  previously thought. Dr. Collins then explained Darwinian
  gradualism as if it were dogma. This oversimplification is
  typical of those who never studied Biology except at a Medical
  School. This is not entirely his fault, however, since many
  scientific journals will not publish research where evolution
  isn't perfectly gradual and perfectly random. Their motivation
  should be perfectly obvious, but it's not even on Dr. Collins'
  radar. He also uses Mendel's peas as a pivotal point in our
  understanding of genetics, assuming the reader would be ignorant
  that Mendel's data was `dry-labbed'. Usually an author who writes
  on this subject is strong in either Biology or Theology. Dr.
  Collins relies on two sources for his treatise on Theology: St.
  Augustine and C.S. Lewis. I happen to agree with him that the
  Creation Story and the books of Job and Song of Solomon have a
  "lyrical and allegorical flavor". I would include the Book of
  Jonah in that category as well. However, there is an entire
  literature on the subject that is completely overlooked. The only
  time Dr. Collins makes a strong case for anything, it is to
  refute Edward O Wilson, Richard Dawkins, and their minions. Even
  then, he uses a quote from the late Stephen Jay Gould for his
  most scathing criticism. Francis Collins is the consummate
  politician--he takes a stand without offending anyone. Dr.
  Collins knows that Jesus was not a politician, and He did not
  worry about offending the intellectual elites of his time. Take
  this quote from Mat 23:14 "Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees,
  hypocrites! for ye devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make
  long prayer: therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation."
  Dr. Collins' book claims to be a middle ground for theists and
  scientists. In my opinion it is a piece of fluff and a
  narcissistic retelling of the Human Genome Project myth.</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">Take some talented actors and put them in an
  age old story of smart kids versus dumb adults and you get more

  off on our kids? They deserve better. The key point of this movie
  is that lying is bad. Good point. A device used to bring out the
  truth is creative pranks. Also good. Unfortunately, the pranks
  fall flat as they are totally implausible (even kids will have a
  hard time believing a man can't tell he's been dyed blue until he
  looks in the mirror), and since they are the device used to bring
  the movie to its conclusion, the entire thing falls flat. Making
  films for children is a fine thing. They shouldn't be dumbed down
  or even given an uncritical eye just because they are for
  children, however. Quite honestly, I'd rather have a kid watch
  something like "Good Will Hunting" before this. Don't waste your

  <Text category="music">my review is written here only for seekers of

  reviews. i have all 19 halos, and exclusive and unreleased
  remixes and demos, and i love all of it, including the entirety
  of the fragile, fixed, perfect drug versions, still, further down
  the spiral v1 and v2, the deluxe edition of the downward spiral,

  nine inch nails song not worth having. painfully uninspired and
  recycled, musically, lyrically, and visually (the video was an
  embarassment- again, the only one in a catalogue of otherwise
  disturbing, beautiful brilliance), DEEP is a song and phase trent
  himself has admitted to wishing to forget entirely. my advice:
  take it as a mark that he is, after all, human, but leave it here
  on the tomb raider soundtrack, unpaid for, for it will never show
  up on an official halo as burn (originally for natural born

  recordings of about a dozen people having random conversations
  over the phone and laughing for no reason. It would have been
  nice if they had put these `commentaries' on different tracks
  because the way they have it on this CD you have to wait through
  about a minute and a half of this crap to get to the song you
  want to hear. The worst part about the album is the lack of The
  Fugees, which means no `Killing Me Softly'. Sadly, you can tell

  tend to like my rock harder, with two arms and less cheesy.
  Sadly, this record doesn't fit the bill. For that, Pete Willis

  This album is definetly the former. I'll beg to differ with the

  <Text category="book">Reading through John Irving's "The Cider House
  Rules," I found myself continuing to read mostly out of a desire
  to have the book over and done with and only partly out of a
  sense of curiosity. In obtaining a bachelor's degree in English,
  I had to read a lot of books. Among them were many books that I
  did not like, but never before had I read a book that was so
  completely devoid of subtlety. Every single scene in the book
  feels as though it was specifically designed and manufactured by
  the author to move the plot along. People become pregnant, have
  abortions, and die with such terrible regularity that you can
  foresee it dozens of pages before it happens. This goes way
  beyond mere foreshadowing. The book doesn't flow naturally, you
  can virtually see the author hiding in the shadows, playing the
  puppet master. There are just so many coincidences, so many old
  friends just happening to run into eachother, so many people
  becoming pregnant just at the exact time to make the story
  progress perfectly, all of the characters vaguely, distantly
  connected to eachother. I don't want to spoil the plot, but
  suffice it to say that the plotline involving the Eames (rhymes
  with screams) family is just too much coincidence to bear. It's
  as though the author is God, and the characters completely lack
  free will. And then there's the "protagonist," Homer Wells. I put
  protagonist in quotations because despite being the center of the
  story, Homer Wells barely does anything in the story. He barely
  even speaks during the story. He is virtually a non-character,
  devoid of personality or will, around whom the other characters
  and events of the book revolve. The scenes that do not involve
  Homer Wells at all, and they make up the majority of the book,
  are without fail the most interesting scenes. I think that the
  real protagonist of the book is Dr. Larch, but even Melony seems
  more real than Homer does. The story is very long and rambling.
  Subplots are begun and then abandoned and only mentioned in
  passing much later on. Minor characters keep popping into the
  story, then disappearing, only to pop back into the story exactly
  when they're needed. Conflicts are either quickly and
  conveniently resolved or simply ignored and forgotten (like the
  situation with Debra Pettigrew). After such a rambling, at times
  rather boring plot, the ending feels rather rushed. It is as
  though the author realized that he suddenly had to resolve
  everything, tie up every loose end, in the last 25 pages (and
  tying up loose ends, in this case, means a lot of people
  conveniently dying). To spoil the plot just a little, Homer
  Wells, who has throughout the book been opposed to abortion
  because he feels that a fetus has a soul, suddenly and
  inexplicably and completely reverses on this opinion. I
  personally am pro-choice as well, but I found that Homer's sudden
  reversal was completely contrary to his character and caused the
  ending of the book to collapse into a bunch of nonsensical
  happily-ever-afters</Text>

  <Text category="health">I thought that this would be an ideal product
  for my aging father as both his sight and his dexterity are
  somewhat impaired. My first thought was to contact the parent
  company, Hy-Tek Manufacturing, to ask for a dealer referral and
  to get some answers to a few simple operations questions. After 3
  days they did get back to me, recommending Amazon as a purchase
  source but ignoring my request for operations information. I sent
  a second email but it was completely ignored. Maybe this should
  have been a warning. I decided to go ahead and order one anyway.
  The purchasing process was quick and easy and delivery form
  Amazon's agent was about 5 days, more than acceptable. The unit
  comes well packaged with easy to follow instructions. Actual
  programming is simple and very straight forward. The problems
  started after successfully programming my dad's satellite
  receiver. The main menu could not be accessed, the information
  button was non-functional and two of the numeric keys did not
  work. I tried all of the codes listed for the manufacturer of
  that receiver, none of them made any difference. Another email to
  Hy-Tek, and another 3 day wait, produced the response " it
  doesn't work with all devices and I guess it just won't work with
  your receiver, you'll have to send it back to the supplier. We
  will make note of this and maybe we can add this receiver in a
  future update. " No help at all and no concern or consideration
  expressed on the part of the manufacturer. If they had bothered
  to respond to my original inquiry in the first place, I would
  never have purchased this substandard piece of equipment and
  wouldn't have been out the freight charges. One of the questions
  that I asked originally was " will it access the main menu? ",
  but they didn't have the common courtesy to respond. Be aware
  that this remote will not work with all devices. Even simple,
  necessary functions like menu and numbers may not be accessible.

  <Text category="book">Updike failed to hold my attention throughout
  the story both because of its utter lack of suspense in any
  dimension and the inconsistencies in his character development.
  As other have stated, you know from page one that the final page
  will involve an Arab, a truck and a bomb. The lack of anticpation
  must therefore be compensated for by something else - perhaps
  excellent writing, interesting character development or original
  insights. Updike fails to deliver on all three counts. One
  particularly slipshod literary technique Updike uses is the
  phrasing he gives the title character Ahmad. When Ahmad speaks,
  it is in the voice of an intelligent, thoughtful foreigner. His
  phrasing captures very well the cadence, vocabulary and grammar
  of a well spoken non-native speaker of English. Curiously, Ahmad
  IS an American, raised in New Jersey by a thoroughly American
  mother. So, what influences created this stilted phrasing? Updike
  is trying to somehow comvince us that a Jersey teenager speaks
  like a Pakistani or Egyptian immigrant. There is no need for the
  technique and its inconsistency with the character's life is
  grating. Updike also relies heavily on ethnic/religious
  stereotypes. Sterotypes often have some basis in fact but
  generally make for uninteresting literature. However, in Updike's
  case, the stereotypes make little sense at all. For instance, a
  high school counselor's entire personality is attributed to his
  "Jewishness" both by himself and by others who opine on his
  personality. This is particularly curious given that the man was
  not raised as a Jew and, in fact, his family had rather adamently
  turned away from the religion two generations earlier. So where
  does all the Jewsih influence come from? Likewise, Ahmad's
  mother's personality is often linked to her Irish heritage. Yet
  there is no evidence whatsoever that her Irish background (which
  could have been many generations ago) has influenced her one bit.
  The reader is left once again to wonder what motivates the
  stereotype - other than simply poor writing and careless
  character development. Another out of place literay technique
  involves the inclusion of fairly lengthy passages from the Korna
  in Arabic. Obviously, few Western readers will understand Arabic
  and it seems meerely pretensious for Updike to include the
  original language rather than paraphrasing or translating the
  passages. What comes across is an attempt by the autohr to show
  he has done his research. If that is truly the point then the
  reader must wonder why the passages are reproduced in Western
  script rather than Arabic script. After all, the Koran is not
  written with Western phonetics in mind. Ultimately, the book
  leaves one wondering why such a lightweight, poorly constructed
  piece was released by such a skilled author</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">I love me some Mamet. His dialogue takes some
  getting used to, since it is crafted so as to touch on the edges
  of realism while inhabiting a more stylistic realm. I also love
  his dedication to his actors, employing the same ones over and
  over, so that his movies come off as different shows performed by
  the same theatrical troupe, which may very well be his point.
  However, Edmond is the first Mamet film to leave me disappointed
  and, worse, annoyed. Macy plays Edmond with typical wide-eyed
  aplomb. Edmond is a man who is weak, but is valiantly (if not
  clumsily) trying to be strong. The movie starts with a chance
  encounter with a fortune teller whose tarot card reading provides
  a cinematic outline for the remainder of the film. Edmond then
  goes home, breaks up with his wife, and goes on a deaf, dumb, and
  blind search for himself, finding instead over-priced whores,
  pimps who are not-what-they-seem, and -- generally -- everything
  but himself. I get the point: Edmond is the epitome of modern
  man's emasculation, unable to find his own balls with both hands,
  and his tawdry and panicked search through New York for some
  unnameable salvation is an example of the lengths anyone must go
  (man or woman) to find, if not redemption, then the places where
  one "belongs." There are a lot of problems here. Most
  superficially, there's one of packaging. The DVD box prominently
  features a picture of a gun, and no gun appears in the film. The
  tags on the box call the film, alternately, a mystery and a
  fast-paced thriller, when it is neither one of those things. Not
  even close. This movie is (like most of Mamet's work) based on a
  play; never before has it been more obvious (unless you count the
  absolutely brilliant Oleanna). Edmond is, essentially, a one-man
  show, with Macy delivering numbing and rambling monologues,
  stopped only occasionally to engage in awkward and almost
  meaningless side action with ancillary characters (some of them
  played well -- Denise Richards actually shines in her brief scene
  as a hooker -- and some of them not so well -- Julia Stiles seems
  over-medicated in her role as an ambivalent and easily persuaded
  waitress). In spite of how they do and don't help Edmond make his
  way through the tunnel of decadence and misery he creates for
  himself, most of these characters seem disposable, making the
  movie come across as equally dismissable. (I would also like to
  take a moment here to make a small observation about Rebecca
  Pidgeon, Mamet's wife, an actress who appears, I think, in every
  single one of her husband's films: this woman is, viewed in even
  the nicest of lights, one of the worst actresses I've ever seen,
  and she sucks the life out of every scene she's in. In this movie
  she plays Edmond's wife, and does so with heartless and
  uninspired vehemence. It's nice that Mamet gives his wife the
  opportunities he does, but one has to wonder if she'd ever get
  any acting work at all if she weren't married to such a famous
  writer/director). At the risk of spoiling the film, I will say
  that, at the end, Edmond finally does find where he "belongs," a
  place that, given his previous struggles, makes a lot of sense
  (although the manner in which he finds this belonging might
  offend more than a few viewers). But this is small consolation
  since, by this time, few people are likely to have any sympathy
  for Edmond or where he ends up. His character's slap-dash
  personality combined with the persistent and mostly meaningless
  monologues on fate, fear, destiny and (ironically) meaning make
  for a benumbing and distasteful cinematic experience. A few good
  performances and some nice, visceral cinematography do not save
  this film from its plot and the dialogue that fails to move that
  plot along. Avoid this flick; try Oleanna or Glen Gary Glenross
  instead.</Text>

  inch version used for Soul Train from seasons 13-"Maria" (a
  lackluster lp track from his latest lp, Surrender) should have
  been replaced with the beautiful "Together Always" (from his
  proper sophmore lp, You &amp;amp; I). The horrible and silly
  "Drivin' Force" (also from Surrender) should have been out!
  "Lovelite", "You &amp;amp; I" and "I'm Freaky" lp versions should
  have been on there instead of the 45 versions because they stood

  "Love Has Found Its Way." were the other great ballads and jams
  that were non-singles but were gems as well. The absense of "Soul
  Trains A Comin'(original)", "Together Always", and full versions
  of "You &amp;amp; I", "I'm Freaky", and "Lovelite" really knocked
  off 3 points from Best of O'Bryan cd and should be made into a
  redo!! For those that wasted thier money on this, "go on and cry"
  because Right Stuff Records done ripped y'all off!! This
  underated talented artist (good singer, writer, producer, and
  instrumentalist) was trying to be the next Prince and Michael
  Jackson but he was considered more like a 1980s version of Carl
  Thomas (too soulful for the mainstream). People must have bought
  this cd (if do not have original lps no more) because more than
  half of the tracks are not available on other cds. I admit I love
  all the songs from the cd (except for Maria and Driving Force),
  but I WILL create a new CD under my productions, SOUL TRAIN
  ALUMNI SERIES along with my own compilations of Shalamar,
  Jermaine Stewart, Pebbles, Jody Watley and other Soul Train
  almumnis. 1. Soul Trains A Comin' (original although I love the
  remix; loved the keyboard fanfare on the intro) 2. The Gigolo 3.
  Still Waters 4. Right From The Start (great track and catchy
  hooks!!) 5. I'm Freaky (full lp verison, the keyboard solo was
  missing from the 45 single 4 minute version) 6. You &amp;amp; I
  (full original lp version. Loved the closing) 7. Together Always
  (O showed his true feelings on this 1983 track) 8. Lovelite (full
  original lp version - LOVELITE BABY!!) 9. Breakin' Together (good
  effort and loved the video!!) 10. Go On &amp;amp; Cry (good
  ballad) 11. Lady I Love You (what ever happened to lovin' your
  woman and tellin' her how you feel. This was his best ballad ever
  and this should school young catz like Bobby Valentino and R
  Kelly on real love.) 12. You're Always On My Mind (I'm glad they
  included this lp track from 1984's Be My Lover on the compilation
  and would be good for the redo. Beautiful ballad that shows a
  woman on how you feel although she's seeing someone else). 13.
  Tenderoni (45 single, I never actually heard of the full lp track
  before but it was a good pre-new jack single) 14. Is This For
  Real (great!!!) 15. You Have Got To Come To Me (beautiful new
  jack ballad that should have made the charts) This here is the
  real Best of O'Bryan plus more. Wish I can add more like "I'm In
  Love Again", "Doin' Alright", "Surrender" "Love Had Found Its
  Way" and "Shake" but had to pick the best 16 that would fit!! --
  Thank You!!</Text>

  <Text category="music">This was not as good as I had hoped and half
  of it is too slow to listen to while I am working out but the
  rest is good.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">As part of my ongoing quest to catch up on
  comic book movies that I have missed over the past few years I
  came across this clunker. I understand, of course, that I am not
  the target demographic here. Most comic book fans want nothing
  more out of their movies than authenticity; unfortunately I was
  looking for an actual cinematic experience. Four scientists go
  gallivanting around space with some chump named Dr. Von Doom (who
  wins the award for the Most Obvious Name for a Villain Ever);
  they run into trouble and are the recipients of super powers (now
  we're talking) thanks to some chemical filled cloud. What follows
  is one of the most shameless attempts to buy a box office victory
  in history. Special effects pile on top of bad special effects as
  the film is quickly reduced to nothing more than a dull fireworks
  show. We get The Thing caving in the front of a semi-truck with
  his shoulder as the money shot, but it comes in the middle of a
  scene that left me mystified. An entire bridge and just about
  every car on it are destroyed by these four farting around with
  their found powers. But since these are the good guys we have to
  watch as they scramble to save everybody they endangered, and
  succeed. Destruction for the fans, no consequences for the
  characters. But why would director Tim Story try anyways? He
  knows the people are just showing up to ogle at Jessica Alba as
  she pretends to act. So instead of focusing on the story he
  focuses on making sure that those dozens and dozens of product
  placements make it into the frame. He should have just directed a
  Pepsi commercial with Jessica Alba and saved us the trouble of
  watching this mess. The plot is also outwardly defiant in its
  interest in being even a little entertaining. Instead of watching
  good fight evil we are stuck watching the superheroes squabble.
  They aren't even aware that the bad guy is the bad guy until the
  last fifteen minutes of the movie. They go out, show off their
  powers (in things like extreme sports, you know, for the kids),
  and then yell at each other for not being discreet enough. There
  is also a lackluster love triangle between Sue Storm (Jessica
  Alba), Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd) and Dr. Von Doom (Julian
  McMahon). I'm sure it is real nice to believe that someone who
  looks like Jessica Alba would rather go out with a lowly
  scientist as opposed to the all powerful, all wealthy Dr. Von
  Doom. But chances are if you're chasing someone that looks like
  her she's not interested in your kind demeanor and meaningful
  career. So why is my rating so high above the zero I've been
  talking it up to be? Well it is what it is. It didn't put me to
  sleep as it washes over you fairly harmlessly and quickly. It was
  fun watching TV actors such as Michael Chiklis and Julian McMahon
  try their luck at a Hollywood blockbuster. And at least it wasn't
  "Catwoman." But what it was was insulting. Beyond the obvious
  point that nobody would believe Jessica Alba as a scientist lies
  another that shows just how stupid Story thinks we are. At a
  newsstand, on the cover of People magazine there is a picture of
  Sue Storm. Now if Stephen Hawkings can't make it to the cover of
  People then what chance does this two-bit scientist have?

  added less water -- absolutely nothing. The design is built such
  that the water moves down without making any noise. It is useless

  <Text category="toys_games">This is one of the most beautiful looking

  The doll NEVER worked from day one. It's tail bent up and it made

  I notified MGA - the toy maker) were correct - NOT ONE BUYER had
  a working doll!!! We bought this for my daughter, niece and

  directions - they are pretty simple - so that is not the problem.
  Also, the hair falls out and is EVERYWHERE in the bath water

  does is stick to EVERYTHING including your hands. Some are really
  gooey like slimy paint while other tubs are nearly dry and you
  end up with micro-mini styrofoam beads all over the place and

  <Text category="book">This is a tough review to write because I felt
  the authors made a good effort in the writing of the book and
  explanations of the Spring Framework. Writing a book is no small
  feat, and technical books are a special beast. With that last
  statement in mind, this is were the book sadly falls short. For
  one, the source code available online is a significant rewrite of
  the books' code. The authors explain ( on the publisher site )
  that this is because they learned better ways and techniques to
  implement the samlpe application after the book went to print.
  While improvement is always good, this presents two problems. 1.
  The sample application is now out of sync with the material. Not
  a good thing for those trying to learn, as you require more
  effort to study in tandem with the book. Also, and this is not to
  disparage the authors skill, but I buy books because I am
  expecting experienced, if not expert advice. If a small, sample
  application needs rewriting, perhaps they should write about
  something else? Further down this road, the sample application
  has errors that prevent it from compiling. I suspect that the
  final build file was not tested, or it was a case of "well, it
  compiles on my machine". There were several dependencies that
  required changes to the build file so it could be compiled.
  Thankfully, I use Eclipse and imported the project. Eclipse
  immediately informed me of missing dependencies, which I resolved
  by getting those jars on the build path and in the build file so
  they would be deployed in the war archive. Examples are:
  jakarta-commons/collections, and several core Spring jars
  relating to DAO and database access. For an experienced
  developer, familiar with ant and a good IDE, it was not a lot of
  trouble to get it running, it just did not give me a good
  impression. Bonus info for anyone switching the database out to
  postgresql: First, no matter what DB you swap in, you'll need to
  change a few hard coded references in the build file. I made
  property variables which I placed in build.properties. Then you
  will need to change the class User to something else ( and of
  course anything in the app that references it. ). Another great
  reason to use Eclipse. Why you must change it, is User is a
  reserved keyword in postgresql and you will get databases errors
  because you can't name a table User</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">It has been a long time since I read the novel
  upon which this book is based, but I do clearly remember it
  making sense. This movie doesn't even make sense (to quote a
  chicken I know). Marlon Brando somnambulizes his way through the
  film and, instead of coming off as sinister, menacing, and
  dominating, he makes Dr. Moreau into a joke. Val Kilmer's
  portrayal is vacuous and silly. Is the character supposed to be
  under the influence? I guess he wanted it portrayed that way. The
  script? Is there one? Moreau talks about having almost reached
  his goal. Where? His one "son" and his "daughter" do have some
  fine traits, but both are also pretty ineffectual. Several
  reviews have mentioned the special effects. I actually saw very
  few special effects. The rat-people on the boat were creepy and
  well-done, and some of the characters did make some superhuman
  moves, but mostly I saw people in very elaborate, well-done
  costumes, using well-distorted voices. The central character,
  played by David Thewlis, should have been the focus of the movie,
  as he is the narrator. He kept getting lost in the shuffle, and I
  kept waiting for him to see things that I saw, and to ask the
  questions that I would have asked. I like him as an actor, but
  this is certainly not a memorably good performance. It is
  somewhat ironic that he is the witness to animal-human hybrid
  horror here, but is the werewolf in "Harry Potter and the
  Prisoner of Azkaban." The film does create a sense of the
  nightmare. Several of the characters do show glimpses of depth
  and genuineness, most notably Ron Perlman's preacher, but then
  he's well-practiced, from his "Beauty and the Beast" television
  series. That was what (barely) earned this film its second star.
  Let's vote them all off the island, and start over. Robert Duvall
  as Moreau? Replace Kilmer with Matt Damon? Casey Affleck
  replacing David Thewlis</Text>
  <Text category="music">This is not necessarily an indictment of Aimee
  Mann or holiday music....though I do find such disks as being
  cheesey. I was a bit surprised when I heard Mann was coming out
  w/a holiday album. It seemed a bit above someone who has based a
  career on not only original material, but non-mainstream music.
  It has also always surprised me that at the plethora of holiday
  disks that are out there and how many more come out each year. Is
  it just me - or are there only 18 holiday songs in existance to
  begin with? There is only so many different ways to cover "I'll
  Be Home for Christmas", "Winter Wonderland" - all of which I
  believe are covered by James Taylor, Sarah McLachlan and Better
  Midler, all of which were released this month. I'm guessing they
  are cheap to produce and easy to pull in profits. That being said
  - I still like Mann's voice and she comes through with 3-4 songs
  that are above the fray. "Whatever Happened to Christmas",
  "Christmastime" and her original "Calling on Mary". I also liked
  the fact that she covered "You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch". That
  seems to suit her more. Not my cup of tea - but the songs I
  mentioned are the reason the disk gets 2 stars</Text>
  <Text category="book">The best thing about this book is its table of
  contents. In second place is the preface. And then it's all
  downhill. If you want to buy a list of topics in electronic
  communications, with brief summaries that explain absolutely
  nothing whatsover in any great (or even little) detail, and you
  really have no other use for your hard earned $100.00+ dollars,
  then please go ahead and buy this book. If however, you value
  your cash, and would rather buy a book that rather than insulting
  your intelligence, at least attempts in good faith to teach you
  something, then please, don't fall for the marketing ploy of the
  title "RF Microelectronics". Because there's very little "RF" and
  even less "Microelctronics" in this text. Here's a taste of the
  marketing ploy from the very first line of the preface: "The
  annual worldwide sales of cellular phones has exceeded $2.5B." Do
  I see dollar signs in your eyes? I thought so. Don't fall for the
  trap. If you want to learn a thing or two about RF electronics
  theory as well as detailed explanations of what the job of each
  individual component (like a capacitor here or a resistor there)
  in a communication circuit is, then buy: Modern Electronic
  Communication (9th Edition) by Gary M. Miller. The Miller book's
  9th edition is coming out soon. Even with 992 pages of text, it
  costs only $60.00. I believe Razavi's book should never have been
  published because frankly, it's not a book at all. Why it's still
  in print (though stuck at first edition for nearly 10 years), is
  completely beyond any sane person's comprehension</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I had heard so many great things about this
  movie but it is just not my cup of tea. I don't know if it
  because I tend to like more horror type movies or what but I was
  really bored by them. Each of the movies started off really slow
  and they all ended basically the same way. I know the whole theme
  is humans are trash but it would have been nice for a little more
  suspense. The movies were violent but nothing one hasn't seen
  before several times so I am not sure about the shock value of
  it...I wasn't shocked, disturbed or upset.........just

  and minimalist approach on piano make for sleepy moments - if
  driving later in the day. I have heard him with fire and
  brimstone and sometimes it goes over the edge of taste. But it is

  prefer pablum in lieu of something complex and cognitive. Her
  original Cd with it's collection of diminished and augmented
  chords set to deep overlays of texturing, blended with truly
  poetic lyrics has been replaced with a distilled musical joke.
  What on earth gave her the impetus to try to go 'artsy' by
  experimenting with music predating the second world war I'll
  never know. It's obvious her angst is no longer producing art,
  rather it is being replaced with contrived resolution and the
  equivalent of a musical epitaph. Eat it up people, it's all about
  not having to think. It's the kind of tripe that happens when
  someone is trying to hard to think of how to outdo their first
  brush stroke of genius and is confronted with musical block.
  Judging by the news her father is ruining her life and creativity
  as so often is the case in todays less than feminine half of the
  culture.</Text>
  <Text category="book">Reviewer Alianore's opinion "Rather too
  indulgent of its subject" is a very accurate portrayal of Weir's
  work. I will try to add something to that near perfect review.
  (Note: I listened to the unabridged audiobook of "Queen
  Isabella", 22 hrs on 18 CDs). The first half or so of this
  biography is mostly enjoyable, loaded with period details. The
  last third is the worst: Weir's fawning dedication to a glorious
  rehabilitation -- nay, elevation -- of Queen Isabella to the role
  of long-suffering, much-wronged, highly-deserving, and
  late-redeemed Just Queen of England. This book is really
  "subjective, rhetorical biographal dramatization". I do not
  consider it to adhere to an academic standard for objective
  history and analysis. It is rhetoric because of the endless
  "weasel words" (and expressions) used copiously throughout: "Some
  say", "It has been said", "Many believe", "Therefore we may
  assume", "It can be inferred" ... this isn't just an attribute of
  her style ... it *is* her style comprehensively. These
  expressions occur many hundreds of times, commonly in conjunction
  with Wier's subjective analyses that present her beloved Isabella
  in the best possible light, always giving her every benefit of
  the doubt and shifting negative interpretations onto other
  persons. Equally irksome is Weir's double-standard of historical
  psychological analysis. She is always 'declaring' for us the
  contents of Isabella's thoughts. Remarkable gift she has for
  this. Many times Weir reasonably states that modern psychological
  and socialogical interpretations of medieval history are
  inherently invalid or at least not meaningful. But then moments
  later she will portray Isabella's actions from a 21st century
  point of view ... always telling the reader how Isabella must
  have, might have, could have, would have been thinking and
  feeling about one situation after another ... often presented in
  a positive way that is only supported by a present-day
  psychosocial interpretation of 800 year old history. This isn't
  historical writing, it is historical op-ed, with an obvious
  agenda. I don't loathe this work, it is enjoyable in many parts
  for its color characterizations and depth of detail. The narrator
  of the audio book has a wonderful voice and good pacing. But this
  is highly flawed in its editorial approach to historical
  biography. (Other egregious examples of such hagiography include
  Edmund Morris' "Rise of Theodore Roosevelt" and "Theodore Rex". I
  could not complete either of those since Morris is so obviously
  enthralled by his subject, lovingly lionizing him in every sappy
  sentence. Yuck. Really.) If prefer more history when reading (or
  listening to) history. And much, much less editorial
  subjectivity, retroactive psychology, biased interpretation and
  rhetorical postulation. The only way I could enjoy "Isabella" by
  Weir is to accept her bias up front and listen accordingly,
  taking it with "several pounds of salt" as the above referenced
  reviewer advises. 2.5/5</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">I checked this out because I wanted to take a
  look at what the new Doctor Who people have been doing in the
  recent past. The Second Coming isn't quite as cosmic, but it
  certainly engages us in some comparable flights of fancy. Steve
  Baxter (Christopher Eccleston) has an epiphany one night when
  he's out on the town with some mates. He reckons he's become the
  Son of God and he proceeds to turn night into day at Maine Road
  football ground in order to demonstrate his divinely-chosen
  status (a bit like David Icke, except with powers). His immediate
  friends take their time to come to terms with this and despite
  becoming the `new disciples' some of them - notably Judith his
  girlfriend (Lesley Sharp) - remain sceptical. Through the media
  he tells the world that they must come up with a `Third
  Testament'. It later transpires that if they do not, the end of
  the world will soon follow. What are this messiah's credentials?
  Well, he spends forty days in the wilderness which is Saddleworth
  Moor and he has no earthly father - it turns out that his dad is
  infertile and couldn't have fathered him. This tickled me. Did
  writer Russell T. Davis pass his GCSE in Religious Studies, do we
  think? I couldn't really work out whether the religious symbolism
  was unconsciously corny and na&amp;#x1A;ve or whether it aimed at
  giving us a laugh. I'd like to think the latter. Steve,
  curiously, isn't what we might describe as spiritual - certainly
  not religious. He swears all the time, boozes and although not
  quite loutish, is somewhat laddish. He's a laddish messiah. His
  disciples swear at him and he insults them back. (Message to
  southerners - we in the north are not all like this, despite the
  plethora of dramas which suggest otherwise: Preston Front, Our
  Friends in the North, etc. Writers do seem to have this desire to
  patronise us thus.) What's noticeable about the founders of the
  major world religions is that they managed to espouse some degree
  of religious wisdom. Steve, who just witters nonsensically to the
  crowds, seems to lack this facility. Is he meant to be devoid of
  wisdom? Are we asking too much of Russell T. Davis to place some
  in his mouth? Could he have done so had he wished? Presumably our
  writer would need to possess some himself! (Jury's out.) It turns
  out that the party piece belongs to the sceptical girlfriend who
  clearly becomes the mouthpiece for the programme's message. So
  what happens? Despite almost two hours of waiting for Judgement
  Day, with little action or plot development we eventually come to
  learn that our messiah is something of a damp squib. He ends up
  at the girlfriend's home where she feeds him a dish of spaghetti
  a la rat poison which he takes willingly but not before we
  discover that he is really just a sort of encapsulation or
  epitome of human religiosity. Enlightened humanity - Judith -
  finally comes to realise that she can and must live without him
  and she spits him out. They argue for a while before atheism wins
  out and Steve chomps down the poisoned pasta (after the two hours
  I found myself saying `bon appetit'). So we get the sermon,
  although it's a secular one which declares the futility of
  religious belief. But this messiah seemed to me to be almost
  devoid of any meaningful religious ideas anyway. You can't debunk
  what doesn't exist. Steve can't be a foil for atheism if he IS a
  kind of atheism. I suppose that we do end up questioning Russell
  T Davis's understanding of spirituality, not to say he should
  necessarily adhere to religion or spirituality, but perhaps to
  understand it to come degree. And yes, there is a naivety and a
  corniness which underpins all this third-form philosophy, typical
  of so many young people working within the arts. It's a pity that
  the message of the piece couldn't have been delivered within the
  actual context of the drama itself. What we have is a two hour TV
  play followed by a secular sermon, subtext puked out and all. We
  do have an epilogue, however, where our new-found heroine is
  hilariously transfigured at the supermarket. I do recommend The
  Second Coming for amusement, but for enlightenment you'd better
  have something else to hand.</Text>

  just didn't find it involving, suspenseful or stylish enough to

  <Text category="book">I bought this book before my first trip to
  Austria. I had a sinking feeling while reading it that it was
  mostly a pastiche of unusable generalizations. That turned out to
  be true. What shall we do with a paragraph that tells us that
  Austrian women are strong-minded and independent and organize
  their homelife well, although many go to work? This book might
  have some value for a person who had never left their
  english-speaking homeland before and needed to be warned that
  people are sometimes naked in the sauna or at the beach. It also
  provides some amusing anecdotes about language (especially
  viennese) and useful info about festivals. Mostly, though this
  book was good for reading aloud to Austrian friends. I would
  quote it as an iron-clad authority when their behavior didn't
  quite match the book's version and thereby amused them
  tremendously. --Lynn Hoffman, author of THE NEW SHORT COURSE IN

  <Text category="dvd">Even though I am not a Streisand fan, I was
  astonished at just how dopey and annoying this movie was. The
  plot is supposed to revolve around a big change in appearance for
  Streisand's character, making her attractive - no, irresistible -
  to the main male character. The problem is, she looks almost
  exactly the same before and after the makeover! Somebody
  (probably Streisand) thinks that highlighted hair, a tight black
  cocktail dress, and a baggy-lipped smirk are irresistible whereas
  a pink bridesmaid dress, casual clothes, and everyday looks are
  disgusting. BAAAAAAMP! (That's the fallacy alarm going off: men,
  in my experience, don't care much about clothes and makeup.)
  There was a lot of emphasis placed on the Streisand character's
  losing weight by riding an exercise bike, but she looked exactly
  the same afterward - no detectable weight difference! Yet truly,
  the low point of the movie is the scene in which Streisand,
  discussing her baby and early-childhood photos with her mother
  (played by Lauren Bacall), blubbers, "Wazz I a pretty baby? WAZZ
  I A PRETTY BABYYYYEEEE?" In that one scene, Streisand's
  neuroticism concerning her looks is fully revealed. The whole
  movie is about this issue, and it's amazing that an entire cast,
  crew, and production company would devote themselves to B.S.'s
  emotional issues like that. I really think that the "Funny Girl"
  phenomenon somehow ruined Streisand's thought processes. The
  media buzz about her at the time was that she was kind of cute
  despite being light-years away from the stereotyped, Northern
  European beauty standard of the time (think Grace Kelly; think
  Ingrid Bergman.....). I recall reading about how her glowing
  complexion, thick hair, and good figure (as well as her energy
  and voice) carried her through despite her looks: long nose,
  large lips, slanted eyes. Myself, I think she looks like an
  Egyptian princess or similar; but she certainly doesn't look like
  Grace Kelly..... So why can't she accept this? The majority of us
  women, whatever our race, color, or bone-structure, learn to live
  with and love who we are.....at least I hope we do! This movie is
  not about that. This movie says that you have to have a certain
  dress and hairdo to be desirable. Maybe I should've given it only
  one star</Text>

  <Text category="music">I'm not exactly sure how to classify this, nor
  do I think it really deserves the time. How this album has
  garnered so many positive reviews is beyond me. My only guess is
  that some tired, pretentious teen on MySpace raved over it and
  voila, the clique was born. Now, I really wanted to like this and
  gave it numerous listens. But each time, it sounds more and more
  like these guys were just doing some busy work around the house,
  started humming some melodies and then recorded them. Immature
  and pretty much unoriginal. And just because an album is labeled
  "concept" doesn't automatically qualify it as a masterpiece. If
  you want a flawless concept album that actually has an
  interesting story just go and buy "The Wall". Unless your circle
  of friends has threatened to emascualte you for not owning this,

  <Text category="book">I ordered this book after reading the rave
  reviews and the who's who of public school using this format.
  Nowhere is it advertised or even mentioned that this is a
  Christian book, espousing Christian dogma and assumptions. I'm
  surprised this is acceptable for use by Government funded public
  schools. Furthermore, there is a lot of non-scientific rhetoric
  in the book that eschews logical debate and exposition. I'm very
  disappointed and consider this to be false advertising. Some of
  the parenting tips are common sense that I didn't think needed to
  be reiterated. A person already interested enough in buying a
  book would already have the basics down. I was looking for more
  than that. The advertising led me to believe that the book would
  be about language manipulation, how to speak more effectively
  with children to ease the learning process. There is false logic
  in some of the parental mistakes. An example is always
  attributing "hovering parents" to ego issues, that a parent
  "needs to be needed". Some hovering parents are survivors of
  abuse and can't see the lines between normal risks and when a
  child is in real danger. False assumptions leads to false
  conclusions. I gave this 2 stars with the thought that someone
  who is so out of the loop and a danger to their child may read
  this book-at least could adopt some common sense. But it isn't
  helping my family.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Well, this was about as formulaically
  politically correct as a movie can get, unfortunately: the female
  teenage protagonist (played by Witherspoon, whose acting powers
  have increased dramatically since her stilted acting here) acts
  masculine and heroic, the male teenage protagonist acts craven
  and flippant. At one ridiculous point, the girl runs around
  acting like a commando, a veritable one-gal army, blowing up the
  bad guys, while the boy hides in a cave sniveling. Later, when
  the boy tries to assert himself by offering to carry the gal's
  backpack as they cross a desert, the gal snaps at him, Bella
  Abzug-style, and walks quickly ahead, leaving him in the dust.
  Clearly a modern radical feminist thing going on here, and what
  is most unfortunate is that this movie was made for a young
  audience and therefore is in keeping with the modern radical
  feminist propaganda which is brainwashing young women into
  unnaturally behaving like men. Of course, in the real world, the
  result for such manly girls, once they become women, is that men
  do not choose them and they remain alone, and therefore become
  bitter--ironically and inevitably blaming men, of course. In this
  movie, the wimpy teenage guy falls for the brassy, masculine
  gal--but that's why they call them movies. When are these
  post-modern writers, artists, and other culture-shapers with an
  agenda going to realize that when they tout modern radical
  feminism, they are touting something unnatural--men simply do not
  prefer masculine females. Men want someone to COMPLEMENT them,
  not COMPETE with them. Men crave FEMININITY in females, not
  FEMINISM. Wow, is there ever a difference in those two forms of
  comportment! This poor teenage guy depicted in this movie, at
  least his character does progress a little bit: by the end of the
  movie, instead of craven and flippant, he graduates to something
  akin to a metrosexual-type with a wild-boy haircut, if that is
  even a step upward. But the plucky gal--she's still the one in
  charge in this fictitious world of upside-down gender relations.
  Uh, another problem with this movie--and there are many--is when
  the kids are going through the Kalahari Desert, something which
  should be, and for a time is here depicted as, a foreboding and
  life-threatening task. Yet we see Witherspoon in this desert
  frolicking with a dog; and we see the boy's flippancy and
  joviality emerge in a totally out-of-place manner, considering
  the dire situation they are in. The sense of urgency which had
  been built up is totally excreted away by these light-hearted,
  inane scenes. Look, I dig Disney kid movies--more realistic ones.
  You know, old style Disney movies. You take "Old Yeller" for
  example. Now there was a quality kid movie, and quite true to
  life. This movie was not. It had a plastic,
  spoiled-American-materialistic-teenybopper feel throughout.
  Disney has gone down the tubes. In any number of ways, they've
  been subverted by radical Marxist agendas (Note: One more of
  these was the fact that an African Bushman was allowed to evince
  a pagan ritual from his PC pagan religion--something called
  "tapping," while the Caucasians were of course not shown evincing
  any sign of their un-PC Judeo-Christian religion--this is bias,
  folks, leftwing, PC bias, same as the aforementioned feminist
  bilge). I am learning to run, not walk, away from Disney stuff,
  and this movie was further cause for me to do so.</Text>
  <Text category="music">Unlike most other items I've bought from
  Amazon, I failed to read the reviews for this particular CD
  before purchasing. Being a fan of the Final Fantasy series, I
  think I fell into a bit of the "fanboy" (well in my case,
  "fangirl" I guess) syndrome. Also I didn't do my homework at all
  and thought this was an orchestrated recording, which it most
  certainly is not. I own most of the Final Fantasy OST's (and
  heartily endorse them for fans of the games) and this particular
  CD does nothing new or compelling to the music. Tracks 1-7 are
  pretty much carbon copies of their OST counterparts. Track 8, the
  opening theme of FFVIII (Liberi Fatali) has a very odd synth-solo
  vocal mix covering what is in the original a very moving choral
  section. Tracks 9-11 again are basically copies of the OST. Track
  12, "Alexandria (Vivi's Theme)" is the only somewhat-original
  track, as it seems to put together several pieces from the FFIX
  soundtrack in a medley of sorts. Unless you are a rabid fan who
  must have everything FF, I recommend saving up and purchasing the
  real OST's instead of this disc. While I don't see non-fans
  flocking to purchase this disc, it might be worthwile if you're
  only slightly interested in the series and want a taste. Even in
  that event I'd be worried this disc would turn those people off
  from the series entirely. Pros: Cheap (I paid $6, new) Track 12
  is worth a listen Cons: Tracks 1-7, 9-11 offer nothing much new

  <Text category="dvd">Why the production team of this movie didn't
  film in New Orleans is beyond my comprehension. When I first saw
  this movie, I could see based on the footage that it was filmed
  in Canada. The terrain is totally different from south Louisiana.
  It looked like a movie set. I guess the set designers thought
  they could put a few stands of fake Spanish moss on the trees and
  a hunk of it in the fountains and a banana tree in that corner
  and a palm in the other. It looked like a theme park! The streets
  looked too clean. For some reason they could not depict the
  elegance of decay of old New Orleans which to me is paramount in
  the telling of these people's lives but maybe I am being too
  technical. All the principle characters all had straight teeth
  and clear skin. Back in the 1840's just about everybody had some
  sort of illness then and they looked it. The actor who played
  Marcel could not act. The actor who played his white father did
  not age at all for 18 years. Still looked the same, yet he had
  very young children by his white wife who he married 18 years
  before. The architecture of the plantation house was also wrong.
  It was'nt even French No live oaks anywhere which are major icons
  in southern Louisiana.The supporting actors and actresses were
  quite good.Let me just say this, white men maintaining women of
  color was not only prevelent in New Orleans but also other states
  in the south, the difference is is that in New Orleans, the white
  master would leave them property and money. Not so in other
  southern states.The more beautiful the woman, the more she would
  receive from the white man.The placage system in New Orleans was
  a business arrangement and it worked for both parties.</Text>

  <Text category="book">I actually know where Trieste was before I
  read this book. Unfortunately I have never visited the city. I
  wanted to read this travel book about this famous city, but after
  a few chapters, I wondered where the book was going to. After the
  final chapter, I still do not know what the author's intentions
  was with this book. Perhaps I don't read too many travel books.
  Obviously the city means a lot to the author, but she did not
  express it clearly in her writing. I was scratching my head at
  the end, and wondering what I read. I learned a little about the
  city, but not in relation to the amount of time I spent reading
  this short book. The city of James Joyce and Maximillian. The
  imperial port of the Austo-Hungarian Empire. The meeting point of
  Slav, German, and Latin Empires. One of the ending points of the
  Iron Curtain. This city breeds interest and yet the author took
  us on a round about journal that confuses the reader. I am sure
  the author's other books are good, her last one was not the
  greatest.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">A 130-minute barrage of unrelieved bathos and
  sentimentality, this Swedish import doesn't so much insult your
  intelligence as complacently assume that you never had any in the
  first place, wouldn't know what to do with it if you did have it,
  and in general favor entertainment that bypasses the brain
  entirely and addresses itself directly to the tear ducts. The
  plot is of the type commonly described in laudatory reviews as
  "well-worn," which seems to be a euphemism for "shop-worn,"
  "clichï¿½," or "stupefyingly unoriginal." Here it
  is (spoilers follow): Daniel, a big-shot conductor in emotional
  difficulties and poor health, returns to the quaint rural village
  of his childhood, takes over and revives the local church choir,
  heals himself and everyone else in sight with his life-affirming
  yet charmingly diffident zaniness, finds love, finds his inner
  child, and finally, at the moment of his and his choir's greatest
  triumph, croaks. A great director and screenwriter might have
  been able to conjure some life out of even this forbiddingly
  stale and schmaltzy program, but Kay Pollack isn't up to it.
  Instead, in a kind of perverse tour de force of misbegotten
  inventiveness, he celebrates, embraces, wallows in the schmaltz,
  throws it at you until it's dripping off you like oobleck, and
  somehow keeps finding more reserves of it tucked away in odd
  little corners of the film. Indeed, there's something
  horrifyingly impressive about the way this movie gets
  relentlessly stupider and more bathetic from the first frame to
  the last: it almost bespeaks a kind of strange talent, albeit of
  the Ed Wood variety; and while watching it I almost suspected a
  cynical provocation of some kind, as in the Kingsley Amis story
  about the poet who, at the end of a long and successful career,
  publishes a volume of intentional gibberish in order to expose
  the critical establishment as a passel of clueless poseurs.
  (Speaking of whom: "As It Is In Heaven" was nominated for Best
  Foreign Film at the Oscars in 2005, after being strewn with
  similar honors in Sweden, where it was reportedly seen by some
  TWO MILLION viewers. We're used to this kind of idiocy from the
  Academy, but what's going on in the country of Strindberg and
  Bergman? Has someone been putting something in the
  kï¿½ttbullar?) A standard feature of movies like
  this (and books like this, if it comes to that--cf. Ayn Rand) is
  that characters are presented not as human beings but as
  representatives of some principle or other that the filmmaker
  deems important and relevant. AIIIH is no exception. The parade
  of didactic marionettes includes: -- Daniel's love interest, a
  ditzy twenty-year-old blonde, who represents the Life Force; --
  the humorless, sexually repressed, hypocritical preacher, who
  represents The Church, which as we all know is a sinister combine
  bent on stamping out the sex drive and repressing all
  manifestations of joy and spontaneity, especially in modern
  Scandinavia; -- the wife-beater whom everybody at first
  inexplicably tolerates, and then finally locks up and
  forgives--who represents Violence and What to Do About It; -- the
  retarded kid whom Daniel insists on letting into the choir,
  chiefly so that he can become the film's symbol of the Virtues of
  Inclusiveness and the Deep Human Wisdom of Special People.
  (Incidentally, it's about time somebody realized that
  sentimentalizing retarded people, in movie after movie, as
  symbols of
  purity/goodness/wisdom-beyond-the-ken-of-those-cursed-with-normal-intelligence,
  or whatever, is just as disrespectful and exploitative as making
  cruel fun of them; it just SEEMS nicer. CAN'T we have a movie
  that depicts a retarded person as a human being? The only one I
  can recall seeing is "Best Boy," a documentary about the life of
  a retarded man that came out about 25 years ago. Apart from that
  they've been reduced to targets of witless ridicule, as in
  "There's Something About Mary," or turned into plaster saints as
  here.) So, to sum up: save your money and your time, which would
  be better spent sleeping or watching reruns of "The O.C." Run,
  don't walk, from your local art theater if this is the main
  attraction. And don't forget the moral of the story, rather
  comforting to me as an expatriate American living in a Europe
  that preens itself on its superior wisdom and sophistication
  vis-ï¿½-vis the USA: kitsch is global.</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">The daughter of a prominent Boston doctor is
  dead, apparently from a botched abortion (which was illegal in
  the late 60's). Dr. John Berry's friend, Art Lee, is in jail for
  the crime, which he says he didn't commit. So, Dr. Berry sets out
  to prove his friend's innocence, and runs into cover-ups and lots
  of secrets. But there are many doubts, such as was the girl
  really pregnant, and did Dr. Lee actually perform the surgery,
  and why is Dr. Berry so interested in finding the culprit? For
  Michael Crichton's first novel, it's not bad, but nowhere near as
  good as some later ones. The plot is marginally interesting, but
  it was hard to keep characters straight and the dialog didn't
  sound very natural. Dr. Berry (who just takes the whole work week
  off to investigate) talks more like a cheesy "private eye" than a
  doctor. Also annoying was the use of footnotes and endnotes to
  explain various medical terms and concepts - nice to know but
  annoying to look up</Text>
  <Text category="music">There's a reason Oar flopped when it was
  released back in 1969: it sucks. Thirty eight years later, with
  Skip Spence safely in his grave, some now give this pitiful mess
  *five* stars. Since you can't give more than five stars here,
  they're saying Oar is on a level with masterpieces like Sergeant
  Pepper... Dark Side of the Moon... Led Zeppelin 4....! Just
  between you and me, I think the government is still secretly
  drugging people. With all due respect to Skip's venerable memory,
  Oar is a painful aural experience. The first two tracks, Little
  Hands and Cripple Creek, are halfway good, and show some
  production values; but things quickly deteriorate from there. One
  gets the impression the rest of Oar was cobbled together in the
  recording studio just prior to taping - then put in the can after
  only one or two takes. Lastly, the bass playing and drumming are
  just awful. Yes, it's too bad that things ended up like they did
  for Skip. And it's hard not to sympathize with him - he flew high
  only to crash hard. But let's keep a sense of perspective: His
  tragedy did not translate into good music. One extra star in his
  memory.</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">I admit that my expectations were totally
  wrong concerning this film. I was expecting a Spanish reworking
  of Noel Coward's famous play about the dead returning to
  humorously haunt the living. The advertising for Volver in the
  local media certainly led me to have this expectation. Maybe this
  is why I found this film to be so perplexing and disappointing.
  But even on it's own terms I found Volver a difficult movie to
  enjoy. Others see a celebration of strong women. I see a movie
  about murder, incest, deceit and theft. Every main character here
  is a criminal. Raimunda, her mother, her daughter, all commit one
  crime or another, some truly monstrous. Who is there to admire?
  This is empowerment? I'm trying to avoid spoilers here but
  suffice to say there is not one truly likable character in this
  whole film. Aside from the overall unpleasantness of the movie a
  director as experienced as Almodovar should have produced a
  tighter work than this. There are numerous loose plot threads
  here. The whole subplot concerning the Jerry Springer-like tv
  show didn't really make any sense. The restaurant owner seems to
  like Raimunda but nothing comes of this. In fact the whole
  restaurant subplot just peters out, with no resolution. When the
  movie ended my first thought was "What, that's it? It's over?".
  People might say "Well, life has loose ends" but this is a movie,
  not life. It should have an ending. I know I'm definitely in the
  minority concerning Volver. My wife thinks I'm nuts for not
  liking this film but I really think the emperor has no clothes

  <Text category="dvd">Don't expect a comedy in the vein of TRINITY
  or THEY CALL ME TRINITY. If you do, you are in for a fall. Both
  of those were silly but redeemed themselves by being
  entertaining. This one has no such pretensions. It is merely
  boring. The story concerns a corrupt mining company out to cheat
  the local town's folk out of their claims. They do this through
  intimidation and violence. When a couple of friends get hold of a
  claim, they put together a plan to secure that claim and those of
  the rest of the town from the bad guys. To do this, they enlist
  the aide of a traveling circus to serve as a distraction. They
  yell, they fight, they wrestle, they shoot and then they do it
  some more. Its not very exciting cinema. This production is made
  worse by the DVD. I suspect that the original film was a rather
  low budget affair. The DVD, however, is of such low quality that
  who could really tell? The edges are clipped off, the transfer is
  grainy and the effect is of someone holding a hidden handycam in
  a theater trying to bootleg it. IT was not worth the effort.

  <Text category="dvd">As a character movie this is largely a
  failure, unless you find poignancy in "average-ness." The
  characters are all one-note half-stereotypes who seem to be
  sleeping their way through the non-existent plot. "Oh, look how
  average they are! Isn't it charming how they sit around and talk
  about nothing? It's so lifelike!" And the main character's
  seeming inability to be anything other than perfectly angelic at
  all times makes it awfully hard to sympathize with her. If this
  is intended to be an issue movie with the message Robert Ebert
  has suggested (that anti-abortion laws are really just a form of
  discrimination against poor women), it's taking a rather
  belabored approach just to tell us what anyone with a head on
  their shoulders already knows. Munich and Syriana also "bring to
  light" ideas that are not new or novel or shocking to anyone who
  cares to be informed and think about the world. Perhaps the only
  thing truly shocking is that movies like this would need to be
  made to say such obvious things. Perhaps next they'll make a
  movie to make the point that, shockingly enough, the sky is blue,
  or that paint dries when applied to walls, or that grass grows. I
  imagine they'd be somewhat more interesting than this

  <Text category="dvd">The casting for this production could scarcely
  be better (of particular note is the harrowing performance of
  Judi Dench) and it's one of Shakespeare's best plays. That said,
  this film of a production on stage doesn't quite carry the
  viewer's interest for the entire play. There are times when the
  actors seem downright pretentious; you feel as if they're
  tellings us, "We know how deep this is so appreciate it, please."
  That's too bad since "Macbeth" is a work thriving with intense
  imagination with a few hallucinations thrown in so it should
  invite a great film. Sadly, this relatively slow-moving
  production isn't it. There are, of course, wonderful moments with
  Mackellan and particularly Dench (no one plays the scene where
  Lady Macbeth goes crazy better than Dame Judi). I just don't know
  if that alone makes this a worthwhile purchase. For my money,
  Kurosawa's "Throne of Blood" is a far better choice.</Text>

  <Text category="music">This album is one of the only live albums that
  I don't have. I have heard samples, and a few extra songs on
  other cds though. The first thing I hear from somebody that tell
  about this album is basically that Stevie couldn't have been more
  high. His performance was just imbarrassing for the other members
  in the group (specifically Reese Wynans). Most poeple don't know
  this but, on the old vinyl copy of this album, (I've never heard
  it but someone told me) there was originally a 14th track. It was
  the song that usually comes close to the end of Stevie's sets.
  The song was Life Without You. Since it was the very last song,
  I'm guessing Stevie was more pooped than ever beacause it was the
  last song and that he was extremely high and everything. Being
  high is one thing, but being high and playing your last song in a
  set is terrible. In the old vinyl disc, Stevie was on his last
  song and he was so terribly slow that Reese Wynans walked off
  stage embarrased and discusted. This track was taken off the
  album because of its discracefulness</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">I had high hopes for this movie, Marlon
  Brando, Robert DeNiro, and Edward Norton, how could I go wrong
  with this movie with a cast like that? Despite the cast this
  movie sinks under a terrible script. The film is often tedious
  and the characters never seemed very realistic to me. This was a
  poorly contrived and at times silly film. The tension never
  really builds even though the filmmakers try. Embarassing for all
  involved. I only give it two stars to be nice to the cast</Text>

  <Text category="health">The concept is cute, although the size makes
  it a bit difficult to store when you are not wearing them, but
  the main problem is that they give you hat hair, compressing your

  go in between the hairs, so everything fluffs out. If you never
  take off your reading glasses, have a buzz cut, are bald or
  otherwise wear your hair flat against your head (but be careful

  conventional glasses are a better bet</Text>

  Fuel w/ ephedra several years ago. I needed energy this time and
  to lose a few extra baby pounds. Within minutes of taking my
  FIRST and ONLY pill I had a horrible reaction. I broke out in
  WELTS within 10 minutes all over my body. I was shaky and sick to
  my stomach. I drank 5 glasses of milk to neutralize it and
  finally started to feel better. I thought I was going to die. My
  only thought was there was no way losing weight was worth never
  seeing my kids again. After about 2 hours the welts disappeared
  but I felt horrible for the rest of the day. Obviously there is
  something in it that doesn't get along with my body but after
  that reaction I had I have decided that no diet pill is worth the

  gooey sugary base. What I received was a bar with little taste,
  nothing at all similar to the name on the bar. In my opinion, the

  <Text category="music">I do not understand why people are so waxing
  poetic about this album. There is nothing new or 'fresh' or
  'original' or at all thought-brovoking about this music, unless
  you happen to be easily pleased by any simple pseudo-pop sound. I
  have only recently discovered the world of no-wave music, but I
  was introduced to it through artists like Arab on Radar and
  Scissor Girls. So when I tried out my first Sonic Youth album, I
  was way more than dissapointed. I don't know how this can be
  classified as no-wave anymore. Sure they show some trait in a few
  wailing off key guitars and an occasioinal shouted spoken word,
  but they are all only half-assed and are muddled up in cliche
  indie pop love tunes that have only been done in every other
  band. The most notable anything is the catchy medlody of Becuz.
  It is really catchy, yet it managaes to be unique enough to rise
  above the typical "catchy tunes" ethos. Xiu Xiu's "Knife Play"
  would probably be considered more of a pop/no-wave sound that
  does not sacrifice the aggressive anti-music drive of no-wave...
  AND still retain the emotional pop sinsibility. I don't know..
  All I know is that Wasing Machine is a letdown. It does not reach
  me artistically by a long shot. Emotionally, I can think of am
  million other artists (Mars Volta, Emerson Lake &amp;amp; Palmer,
  cLOUDDEAD, Ulver, Edvard Greig!) who can put me on a much higher
  cloud and help me get in touch with the human condition. This
  however is far to cheezy, and I don't know, but I think it reeks
  of that shallow indie fashion clique..</Text>

  <Text category="toys_games">Purchased 2 pairs for my 8 &amp;amp; 9 year
  old daughters for Christmas. The shoes are made of cheap pieces
  of plastic. The box includes bunches of black, elastic bands that
  you need to really s-t-r-e-t-c-h onto the shoes to provide the
  "bounce". The more your child weighs, the more bands you use, but
  you have to double or triple them onto the same hooks. They are
  very hard to install and could be dangerous if they snap back
  into your face while you are installing them. Once assembled, the
  kids played with them for about 10 minutes before becoming bored.
  They haven't played with them since. Don't waste your

  <Text category="dvd">Fight Club is without a doubt the greatest
  film I've ever seen. Yeah, I'm a fanboy. And what? And to make a
  great film flow, you need great music, right? Well, you need
  great music that fits the film, and the Dust Brother's score more
  than does the trick. The film is dark yet satirical, and it
  needed a score that would compliment that. However, the score
  simply doesn't stand up on its own. At times in the film it
  perfectly enhances the dark atmosphere, but its only a part of a
  tense scene. And hence, it sounds rather empty by itself. No
  matter how much you like the film or thought the music sounded
  good in it (as I did), I wouldn't recommend it. Like so many
  other scores, it could have been made into great music but fails
  since its just lifted from the film</Text>

  <Text category="music">Generally on Amazon.com, the average rating of
  an album does not accurately indicate its quality - that is, the
  albums are usually highly overrated. This is probably due to the
  voluntary nature of the reviews and the fact that the fans of an
  artist are far more likely to review their albums and give them
  high scores than a casual music listener giving them the score
  they deserve. As a result of this, generally, albums that have an
  average score of 4.5 - 5 stars are usually excellent albums. Ones
  with a score of 4 are generally good and 3.5 indicates a pretty
  average album. Average scores any lower than 3.5 stars generally
  indicate a pretty poor album. As I mentioned before, due to the
  high proportion of fans reviewing albums, the average score
  rarely falls below 3 stars. It takes a pretty horrendous album,
  like Limp Bizkit's Results May Vary, to get a score of even 2.5.
  In fact, I didn't even think that it was possible for an album to
  get less than 2.5 - that is, until I saw this pile of feces. Now
  to put this average score of 2 into context - this means that the
  proportion of "hataz" reviewing this album is even more than the
  proportion of fans reviewing it. Out of all the terrible albums I
  have viewed, I have never seen this happen before. Not even to
  bands as terrible as Limp Bizkit or even An*l C*nt. This
  obviously indicates a decline in fan numbers and, hopefully, the
  end of Chingy's 15 minutes of fame</Text>

  <Text category="music">When it comes to Big Star's 70's output, you
  can call me a HOPELESS FANBOY, because after listening to In
  Space, it seems that ONLY a hopeless fanboy would think that
  thirty-some-years later, exactly one-half of the classic Big Star
  lineup could---or in forever difficult Alex Chilton's case, WOULD
  be so inclined---to attempt to recapture the
  lightning-in-a-bottle transcedent pop magic that made those 70s
  discs so great. This disc has WAY MORE in common with Chilton's
  oft-times difficult, mostly self-indulgent solo work than with
  any of Big Star's previous fascinating pop near-perfection. While
  I'll admit that I have enjoyed a good chunk of Chilton's solo
  work, (in a slightly guilty, rolling-my-eyes, "Oh...that Alex!"
  sorta way...) my musical sensibilities are somehow offended by
  the fact that THIS group and that THIS particular collection of
  songs are presented as "Big Star." In Space is connected
  musically to the original Big Star by little more than the fact
  that two of the same guys in THIS BAND were in THAT BAND. If you
  don't expect much, you won't be disappointed.</Text>
  <Text category="music">He was at his best when he sang about the
  loneliness, perseverance and dreams of ordinary people. In
  "Sandra" for instance it felt like he was singing about a
  neighbour. The combination of his warm voice with his piano could
  be very moving and was definitely unique. In the late eighties he
  started focusing on merely performing and doing cover versions.
  He released a few inspired tracks now and then, his first
  Christmas album had a lot of charisma and warmth, and "Here at
  the Mayflower" was a sincere effort. He is an intelligent person
  who cares for music and doesn't let his superstardom go to his
  head. So, what has changed? And why this late in his career?
  Barry has reinvented himself as a Las Vegas entertainer, Liberace
  style. And he's released an album with unchallenging versions of
  evergreens. I have no doubt that he genuinely wants to make
  people happy, like Liberace did. And I have deep respect for
  that. But I personally regret that Clive Davis and Manilow have
  now decided to manufacture products for a larger audience - one
  that doesn't really have any demands.</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">Why did they even bother transferring this
  movie to DVD? Seriously? The [...] child of a masterpiece, "The

  sucks. If I hadn't seen the original I'd just think, "what a
  brilliant plot, too bad they decided to bury it (no pun intended)
  with everything else in the movie". Jeff Bridges manages an
  unintentional bust a gut type performance as the sociopathic
  professor; his accent is so forced and ridiculous that one
  wonders occasionally if this a parody of that great, gut
  wrenchingly disturbing, Hitchcockian 1988 movie. Sandra Bullock
  and Kiefer Sutherland are themselves, which add nothing to the
  movie. And the ending. Oh, the ending. We've been cheated.
  Totally cheated. All the power that this clunker might have had
  is torn away in a fervor of "It has to be upbeat!" Hollywood
  cornball syndrome. Sandra Bullock is RESCUED, the villain is hit
  with a shovel, and everything is A-OK! Even though Kiefer
  Sutherland's original girlfriend has been buried alive and
  suffocated. This is [...]of a great movie.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This toy needs work ... First of all, it's
  HEAVY! My daughter (now 19 months) usually likes to pick it up
  and throw it. After all, it IS a ball! We have hardwood floors -

  damage to our floors! We don't have any problems with it moving

  <Text category="book">One of the Spotlight Reviewers says that by
  combining two great characters--Sunny Randall and Jesse
  Stone--Robert B. Parker has doubled our fun. Quite the reverse.
  He has cut it in half. The characterizations of Sunny and Jesse
  are enormously feeble; and the the rest of the characters are no
  great shakes, either. Sunny's Irish Mafia uncle is a cardboard
  cutout. Suitcase Simpson has three funny lines and is heard from
  no more. The villains--Buddy, Erin, Missy, Gerard, Moon--are
  little more than vague names and stereotyping. Spike is relegated
  to a scene and a half. Oddly, the only interesting character is a
  very minor one: Eddie. But he only stays around for 10 minutes
  Even the plot is tissue-thin. The love-story is lame; the
  sex-scenes boring. Worst of all, who should appear but (Christ!)
  Susan Silverman, from the Spenser series: one of the dampest and
  most wooden and least interesting characters in fiction. As with
  "Cold Service" and some others, Parker is just coasting with this

  whose tastes, likes and dislikes, decide it so. Given that
  aesthetic claims are empirically nonsensical--a matter of pure
  subjective opinion--why is it that some art is valued at all
  while some not at all? Besides this interesting question, which
  is put forth explicitly, without the pretentious riddles of
  terrible poetry, and in about 60 seconds, the rest of the movie
  is obnoxious editing and narration. Avoid at all costs.</Text>

  better complement to reading Shakespeare than hearing him, right?
  Well, not with this recording. The cast is made up of
  &amp;amp;quot;distinguished actors,&amp;amp;quot; the insert

  Shakespeare since they were in junior high school. Nor have they
  improved since then: none of the actors has any feel for the
  Shakespearean line. The speaking is stiff and mechanical, and
  half the time it sounds like a Monty Python farce! When there are
  no visual effects to distract us, low-quality acting really

  <Text category="book">Even if somehow Bin Laden did pick up this

  struggling people. The fictional letter/diary to Bin Laden from
  the mother of a fictional attack victim from an Arsenal-Chelsea
  soccer game which eleven suicide bombers interrupted is so boring
  Bin Laden would give it away before learning what the author
  wants him to. The mother just waffles on and on and on and on and
  on taking forever to get to the point of what she wants to say in
  any paragraph. If Bin Laden is ever captured maybe force him to
  read this as torture or something. Also why does Chris Cleve
  chose to glorify Bin Ladden by crediting him with a new attack
  when lets face it he hasn't achieved much since September 11 2001
  other than be the world hide and seek champion cowering in a cave
  somewhere. This book would have been more realistic and made more
  sense as a letter to the IRA, Hezbollah, Hamas, Islamic Jihad or
  one of the current more frequently operating groups.
  Alternatively base it on a fictional mother of a fictional
  character on one of the planes or in the World trade Centre. A
  good concept for a book but poorly written and to be quite frank,

  When I think about the number of times I've heard him touted as
  "World's Number One Best Voted DJ" or "DJ Mag Top 100 Finalist",
  you'd start to think that the man can actually mix records, when
  in fact rather than mix them, he tends to grind them together
  roughly into a nightmarish aural paste then reconfigure them
  violently in new, unusual and horrendously nauseating forms. I
  can absolutely confirm this. I have had the startling and

  be given clues so as to be involved in the logical process of
  solving the crimes. The narrative in general is not Kellerman at
  his best, either. The characterizations are so shallow that one
  wonders all the time why the characters act like they do. A small
  part of the book talks about Brazil, and Kellerman simply invents
  a couple of Portuguese words making them sound Spanish:
  ("favilla", "favillitos"). One wonders how much of the author's
  research is similarly fictional. In sum, a book carelessly
  executed</Text>

  <Text category="book">'Introducing Postmodernism' is a good source
  to gather names of philosophers, architects, artists,
  anthropologists, linguists, and everyone in between that have
  been somehow connected to PM. The problem, and it is a big one,
  is that this style of tour de force writing does little to
  contextualize all these diverse disciplines. Sure, if you only
  have half an hour to read up on PM, you can whip through this
  book and go on with your life. But if you're wanting to really
  absorb the phenomenon, and perhaps go on to read more, this book
  is NOT the place to start. Check out David Harvey's 'Condition of
  Postmodernism.' This will rip the top of your head clean off!
  It's much more weighty (in every sense of the word), but your
  understanding of PM will vastly improve, and will better prepare
  you to go on to other important writers of the 'genre'</Text>
  <Text category="book">Never in my life have I been so outraged by
  what I have read as by the drivel spouted by Dr. West in this
  book (in his Translator's Note), and by the use of
  `unponderingly' and "the Thinkery" (among other things) in his
  translation of The Clouds. I also read his translation of Plato's
  Apology of Socrates, and found it grossly inferior to Jowett.
  Four Texts on Socrates is not a book to be tossed aside lightly:
  it should be hurled with great force. (Apologies to Dorothy
  Parker.) Not only are the translations themselves inexcusably
  inept, almost everything that he writes in his Translator's Note
  is wrong. The Clouds is a play, not a scientific or mathematical
  treatise. As such, it has characters and dialogue. A `modern'
  translation of a play must be something that could be presented
  on a stage and make sense to a `modern' audience. If a character
  is supposed to be bizarre or out of the ordinary, one does not
  make him spout drivel such as 'unponderingly'; one gives him a
  `shtick', which is a theatrical term. It's more or less a running
  gag associated with a particular character. You create, through
  clever ways of speaking or odd ways of stringing his words
  together, a characterization. He could be made to speak like a
  parody of William F. Buckley or the Star Wars character Yoda. As
  it stands, West's text cannot be presented as a play. It is
  neither necessary nor useful to coin such nonsense as
  'unponderingly'; indeed, it is inexcusable. It conveys neither
  humor nor cleverness. It comes off simply as stupid. The
  translator of a play must know something about theatre and
  drawing characters, which Dr. West obviously does not. To state
  it bluntly: The translation of plays should be left to people who
  understand theatre and characterization, and who are creative.
  Dr. West doesn't have a creative bone in his body. In regard to
  his translation of Plato's The Apology of Socrates, the
  translation by Dr. West is both original and good, but the parts
  that are good are not original, and the parts that are original
  are not good. After all, when one has the work of such a
  brilliant predecessor as Benjamin Jowett to follow, the
  temptation to do something entirely different is strong. But it
  must be resisted. If Dr. West had merely lightly revised Jowett's
  great work, he would have made a contribution to learning. Alas,
  he did neither. The version by Jowett is clearly superior. Here
  is a short excerpt: "And I must beg of you to grant me a favor:
  If I defend myself in my accustomed manner, and you hear me using
  the words which I have been in the habit of using in the agora,
  at the tables of the money-changers, or anywhere else, I would
  ask you not to be surprised, and not to interrupt me on this
  account. For I am more than seventy years of age, and appearing
  now for the first time in a court of law, I am quite a stranger
  to the language of the place; and therefore I would have you
  regard me as if I were really a stranger, whom you would accuse
  if he spoke in his native tongue, and after the fashion of his
  country: Am I making an unfair request of you? Never mind the
  manner, which may or may not be good; but think only of the truth
  of my words, and give heed to that: let the speaker speak truly
  and the judge decide justly." Compare West's inept version: "...I
  do very much beg and beseech this of you: if you hear me speaking
  in my defense with the same speeches I am accustomed to speak
  both in the marketplace at the money-tables, where many of you
  have heard me, and elsewhere, do not wonder or make a disturbance
  because of this. For this is how it is: now is the first time I
  have come before a law court, at the age of seventy; hence I am
  simply foreign to the manner of speech here. So just as, if I
  really did happen to be a foreigner, you would surely sympathize
  with me if I spoke in the dialect and way in which I was raised,
  so also I do beg of you now (and it is just, at least, as it
  seems to me): leave aside the manner of my speech--for perhaps it
  may be worse, but perhaps better--and instead consider this very
  thing and apply your mind to this: whether the things I say are
  just or not. For this is the virtue of a judge, while that of an
  orator is to speak the truth." "Speaking...with the same speeches
  I am accustomed to speak"? How utterly inept and repetitive!
  Didn't he even proof-read? One doesn't speak with 'speeches', one
  speaks with words! It is obvious that Dr. West never read his
  version aloud as a test of its appropriateness, which is
  surprising, because this work is supposed to be a speech. Dr.
  West's version is clearly not suited to speaking aloud, whereas
  Jowett's is. In West's translation, Socrates is a clumsy,
  repetitive, and inept speaker. Needlessly so. If you want to read
  a good translation, see Jowett's 3rd edition (1892). Why does Dr.
  West believe himself qualified to make translations? Nothing in
  his work suggests that he is competent in any way to do so. This
  is not the work of a scholar, but that of a bungling hack. These
  translations are travesties. How does work this nauseatingly bad
  get published? NOT RECOMMENDE</Text>

  <Text category="music">Remember the days when we were punks and we'd
  gather 'round the phonograph and listen to some Puccini on the
  old Edison cylinders? They held up to 4 minutes of music! Count
  'em, 4 minutes! Then that hippie opera singer Enrico Caruso came
  along and all the young punks would listen to him, including
  myself. He was quite the singer. When I was a young kid though,
  the only form of music we had were the concerts. I remember
  seeing Franz Liszt play the piano in concert, quite an amazing
  virtuoso, and Johann Strauss Jr. conducting his orchestra, those
  were the days. Then they came out with those things called
  grammophones, which were even more modern, if it was even
  possible. But it was, because then they came out with a new
  modified version of the phonograph that all the young punks would
  listen to, lazy kids. I mean, you didn't even have to crank a
  handle like you had to with grammophones. And what's this, 1
  hour, a full 60 minutes of music, on 1 record? Pshaw! 4 minutes
  of music was all I needed, and I was still pooped out even after
  that. In my day, it was bed at 4 p.m., breakfast at 2 a.m., then
  off to the mines. We didn't have 60 minutes of free time. I have
  no idea what form of music they have now. Appearently, they came
  out with a couple other things after the phonograph. Now all I
  see these days are kids with their fancy eye-pods (?) and MP3,
  MP4 players, whatever they're called, listening to that "hip-hop"
  tomfoolery of theirs. You can't even call it music, it's just
  noise. Well, gotta get ready for bed now, it's almost 3:45</Text>
  <Text category="book">"The Island of Lost Maps" is the story of a
  petty crook named Gilbert Bland who stole rare and irreplaceable
  maps in the '90s. Posing as a researcher, Bland would enter
  rare-book collections and slice old maps out of antique atlases
  with a single-edged razor. Then he would sell the maps to
  unsuspecting -- or at least unquestioning -- dealers. Before
  being busted at the Peabody Library at Johns Hopkins University
  in Baltimore, he had stolen more than a half million dollars'
  worth of maps. "Island" is the first book for author Miles
  Harvey. In the book, he tries to pull together enough material on
  the crime and map collecting to create an appealing 350-page
  book. He is only partly successful. I found the material on
  Bland's crime fascinating. However, Bland as a subject does not
  fill the entire 350 pages because his life is dull. Unfortunately
  the author inflates incidents and descriptions to pad the text. I
  found myself skipping pages to get back to the crime. There is
  some interesting stuff about map engraving in the age of
  discovery and modern mapmaking. But as a true crime book, it over
  extends itself. It would be a more interesting book to read if it
  were shorter and more focused</Text>
  <Text category="book">This book is a standard one for graduate-level
  algebra courses. I practically wore mine out over a year-long
  course, and came to know it intimately. Dummit and Foote is a
  book that teaches via wordy explanations and lots of examples. Of
  course, examples are very important. However, the explanations
  are often muddled and not clear (e.g. see tensor products). They
  frequently relegate important theorems or definitions to the
  exercises, and the organization is poor. Consequently, it can be
  very hard to find things later when you might need them. Also,
  the bindings on this book frequently fail. My book fell apart
  very quickly, and I know other students who had the same problem.
  I recommend Rotman's Advanced Modern Algebra instead of Dummit

  <Text category="health">The batteries that come with this charger
  we're not a problem for me. In fact, I was surprised that they
  were fully charged right out of the package and seem to work
  fine. I was however, disappointed in the charger. The charger
  requires that all four AA batteries be in the charger for it to
  work. You cannot charge just one, two or three batteries because
  the circuit is not complete without all four batteries inserted.
  Also, there are a maximum of two slots for AAA batteries and when
  they are in use none of the other AA slots are usable. Given the
  price of NiMH batteries, the charger works out to be about $2...

  <Text category="toys_games">The only thing "Deluxe" about this addition is
  the glossy foil cover of the box, which is designed to make you
  think you are getting something special by paying more money.
  Nothing could be further from the truth. This edition screams
  "CHEAP" from the second the lid comes off. Let's go thru the hype
  above and set the record straight on all the "Deluxe" features:
  The board is a quad-fold affair, redesigned presumably to allow a
  smaller, less expensive box. It has much less rigidity than the
  single-fold board of the "classic" version. When it is left out
  for an extended period of time, especially overnite, the ends of
  the board curl up and refuses to lay flat. The houses and hotels
  are completely featureless, just small blocks of wood. They
  looked to be dipped in some type of vegetable dye rather than
  painted. This is probably an attempt to eek out a few extra cents
  of corporate profit. The "bankers tray" and "property wheel" are
  flimsy plastic jokes. Neither would last under play by children
  much more than a few games. This edition is a sad legacy to a
  great game, and the cheapness of the set detracts from the joy of
  play. For the additional cost, all you are really getting is the
  fancy foil cover and one extra play token, plus a board that
  curls up at the edges: Whoopee! My advice: Save the extra money
  and buy the "classic" version.</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">They say all the major characters come back in
  `Stitch the Movie,' quickly made direct-to-video sequel to the
  hugely popular `Lilo and Stitch.' For me, the original film's
  most appealing part is, and will be, Lilo and Stitch, one of the
  most delightful characters Disney created in the last decade. Do
  we still need Pleakley when we have Stitch? How about Cobra? Or
  some alien whose name you have forgotten? Do we need them? No, I
  don't think so. But `Stitch the Movie' crammed all these
  characters into this small film of which running time barely
  exceeds one hour, together with a weak story that repeats exactly
  what the original was doing. The original's idea of `Ohana' or
  `family' is changed to `cousin' this time, but for most of the
  viewers this is literally a twice-told story, no longer
  attractive enough. What makes us feel short-changed is, however,
  the lack of music and scenery, the impressive parts of `Lilo and
  Stitch.' Instead of Elvis songs, they have thrown in parodies or
  homage to other films and TVs like Monty Python and Ed Wood,
  completely missing the target audiences who would buy this DVD to
  experience the joyful sound and rhythm of this great singer.
  Moreover, the charming, water-color Hawaiian scenery is reduced
  to the generic, unimaginative backdrop which is barely OK even by
  the lower standard of the Disney's cheap sequels. The only saving
  grace is the presence of the actors who provided the voices to
  the characters. Except that, and the funny but brief scenes about
  the lovely pair Lilo and Stitch, `Stitch the Movie' looks like a
  pilot film for the original. Or perhaps it is.</Text>

  <Text category="book">I first read this book back in the mid-80s
  after watching the miniseries starring Gary Cole as Dr. Jeffrey
  MacDonald. The miniseries absolutely riveted me, as did this
  book. But upon repeated readings, I began to pick up inaccuracies
  and errors. I found that the book, rather than answering
  questions about this case, caused me to question more and more.
  Joe McGinniss, while never a stellar writer to begin with, was
  eventually exposed as the worst kind of writer, twisting facts
  and quotes to serve his own purpose, which was to sell his theory
  and therefore, his book. I have nothing against Mr. McGinniss
  forming his own opinion as to Dr. MacDonald's guilt or innocence,
  but to omit certain facts and blatantly lie about others and
  misquote principals and research in order to further your own
  propaganda is sickening. If you want Joe McGinniss' theory on how
  and why the murders happened, with no regard to the cold hard
  facts and legal evidence, pick this book up. If you want to read
  about the case, with all the facts in place both supporting and
  questioning Dr. MacDonald, do as other reviewers have suggested
  and read "Fatal Justice", a far more in-depth review of the case
  and evidence and form your own opinion.</Text>

  <Text category="toys_games">I bought this puzzle for my kid after he
  solved the original cube. I had read the review here and other
  places stating that one needed to be cautious when turning the

  peel back and fall off. We tried using glue (they had no stick to
  them) to put them back but it was not long after that the green
  stickers began curling back and falling off as well. The major
  problem is that these turned out not to be "stickers" after all,
  but rather colored squares of vinyl adhereing to additional
  stickers beneath (all white) by means of static. They fall off
  easily. This is a nice puzzle for show (impressive on the desk)

  <Text category="health">This is the first time in my life I have been
  inspired to come online and write a review of a product. When I
  first saw the ad for this on TV, I thought it sounded like just
  what I needed. I rushed to the store, but it wasn't even on sale
  yet. Finally I found it yesterday at walgreen's- and I hate to
  say- it stinks! I have just below shoulder length curly hair. I
  generally throw in some gel and let it air dry- I hate spending a
  lot of time on my hair. But once in a while I straighten it-
  which involves blow dry with a round brush, and then using a
  ceramic flatiron to finish. I am not very good with a hair dryer,
  and it takes me a long time and I find it awkward managing the
  brush and the dryer, and I don't do a very good job. Plus then I
  need to use the iron too, and it takes me a good 30-45 min total.
  So I thought this product would be great. All in one! A
  time-saver! Easier to use! Well, I was wrong. First of all, it
  took about twice as long just to dry my hair as it would with my
  hairdryer. It's not very powerful. Next, it was barely straight!
  Even on the "4" setting, there wasn't much tension at all. It
  left my hair puffy and frizzy and barely straight. So after an
  hour, I had hair that was not as straight as if I had just dried
  it alone- and I still needed to use the flatiron. Don't be
  fooled. It will NOT give you the flat sleek hair that they
  picture on the box. I just hope I can return it. Guess I will
  stick with my CHI iron for now. I *might* try the "long hair"
  version of this dryer to see if that's any better</Text>

  said this is NOT a manufacturing defect and left the costs of
  repair to me. I checked the manual before I used the shaver in
  the shower - it does not say that you cannot use it in a shower.
  I have not opened the shaver, I have not cleaned it in water.
  Thus, based on my experience, this shaver and Braun are a scam as

  same cannot be said for '60s peers like Paul McCartney or the

  <Text category="music">I bought Guerolito after hearing "Heaven
  Hammer," the remixed version of Guero's "Missing." That remix, by
  Air, is the sort of product that makes remixes valid - it takes
  the passion and yearning lost in the original production of
  "Missing" and makes it feel at home in a louder, more tempting
  sonic landscape. That song became astonishing where the Guero
  song was simply alright, and the new song, "Clap Hands," is at
  least a good time. However, it's hard to swallow the cobbled
  remixes on the rest of Guerolito - the beat and the original of,
  say, "Earthquake Weather," (here as "Terromoto Tempo") are both
  individually appealing enough, but together sound dismayingly
  like they're from different planets and belong nowhere near each
  other. "E-Pro" becomes a groaning mess, the lovely "Farewell
  Ride" an electronic nightmare, and both those descrptions would
  be apt to describe the record as a whole</Text>

  He lyrics aren't all that great either, making him have the worst

  to appeal to the mainstream. There's nothing wrong with that, if

  <Text category="music">I have both Volume I &amp;amp; II so couldn't
  resist buying Volume III. The music was good, can't complain
  about good pickin' like that but I did notice that the original
  intent of the album is being re-thought it appears and it takes
  away from the entire concept for me. Will The Circle Be Unbroken
  II was originally made to showcase the talents of the decendents
  and family of the original players/singers on Vol I. It was
  keeping the "circle" alive by bringing in fresh new sounds from
  new generations of musicians of those who played on volume I. TOM
  PETTY?? Where does that come in to play? How does he fit in the
  circle? I was amazed that "this ones son" and "that ones son"
  were invited to play on this album, but the Huskey's (whom I
  loved for their bass playing) were totally ignored this go
  'round. Junior Huskey played Vol. I, Roy Huskey Jr. (Junior's
  son) played Vol. II. Why wasn't Roy's son John invited to play on
  Vol III? Isn't that the purpose of this album? To keep the circle
  alive? Roy Huskey Jr has 2 sons, one of which is a musician (not
  sure about the other one). Where was he? Given the tradition of
  the albums, I don't see how Tom Petty could possibly be invited
  over a 3rd generation family musician. I was very disappointed to
  find the Huskey's not on this album. They were the backbone of
  the first two. Not just the Huskey's, but there are other
  noticeable's left out of this album as well. It's just a shame
  that such a great concept has gone down the tubes. It seems to
  me, that in favor of the elite, the circle has most definitely
  been broken which really takes away from what the album was
  intended for</Text>

  <Text category="book">This book reads like a horror novel. By
  allowing her dogs (as well as another one in her care) to roam
  freely throughout an urban area crisscrossed by busy roads, the
  author demonstrates her utter disregard for the animals' welfare.
  Not to mention the antisocial attitude she displays with her
  total inconsideration for her neighbors, and for the countless
  strangers kind enough to phone when her lost dogs seek refuge on
  their doorsteps. Oh, and let's not forget the dozens of shelter
  dogs killed because their potential adoptive homes were filled by
  the plethora of puppies spawned by the author's choice not to
  spay and neuter her animals. This book moves at a peppy pace, and
  might have been interesting (albeit morally reprehensible) if the
  author's "observations" actually provided any insight. But those
  eighteen-wheelers on the Alewife Parkway veered closer to poor
  Misha than the author's whimsical interpretations stray within
  range of scientific evidence. Case in point: She is so clueless
  about the reality of canine behavior that she inadvertently
  allows one of her dogs to kill another one's litter of puppies.
  Oops! Any genuine dog lover (or any human with an ounce of
  compassion and common sense) will despise this book. A previous
  reviewer hit the nail on the head: If "feelings" are your road
  map to life, you might enjoy this book. If you regularly take
  your brain out for walk, forget it. Calling this a meaningful
  book about dogs is like calling "Jonathan Livingston Seagull" the

  loves Care Bears and she loves the game hide and seek. This toy
  was a big disappointment! She was so excited when she opened the
  package but when we tried to play with it, she got frustrated and
  lost intrest very quickly. The Care Bear "finder" does not give
  good clues to where the Care Bear is hiding and makes it very
  confusing for a child. It was saying "come find me" even when she
  was within a couple feet of it and she had to be right on top of
  it before it would tell her that she's "getting warmer." It
  doesn't let the child know that they are getting close to it
  until they can see it. My daughter gave up on it quickly because
  she would be wandering the house aimlessly without any clue as to
  it's where abouts. I do not recommend this toy to any one. I
  would have given it no stars, but she does like the bear itself.
  Do yourself a favor...buy a care bear (much cheaper), hide it
  somewhere, and you can truthfully tell your child when they are

  <Text category="dvd">Let me start by saying that I may need to quit
  listening to the opinions of some of my co-workers in regards to
  movies to watch, at least when it comes to the horror genre.
  Numerous people where I work told me that this movie, "The
  Descent" was absolutely one of the best horror movies ever to be
  made. In their defense, my co-workers weren't the only people
  with this opinion, many critics and other moviegoers said the
  same thing. Well, apparently the hype that was built up for me
  regarding this movie was more than the film could live up to,
  because I was sorely disappointed, but more on that later, for
  now I will give you my plot summary for last year's supposed
  horror spectacular, "The Descent" "The Descent" begins with a
  young woman on vacation with her family and friends, when her
  husband and her daughter suffer a tragic accident. One year later
  at the prodding of those same friends, she accompanies them on a
  spelunking adventure, the problem is none of her friends have
  ever been to this cave, in fact it's a newly discovered cave that
  no one has explored as yet. So as they attempt to explore the
  unexplored these brave young women become trapped in the cave.
  Making matters worse, this cave is not like any ordinary cave,
  for this one is inhabited by bloodthirsty mutant creatures who
  have just found their next meal. At the beginning of watching
  this movie I was really interested in the developing story, and
  the shocking opener really caught my attention, giving me a sense
  that this movie is going to be different than most horror movies
  by actually giving you the unexpected. However, once the story
  gets to the part where the girls are inside the cave, which is
  actually where the majority of the film takes place, things begin
  to go awry for the picture. At first, the filmmakers were doing a
  good job of using the claustrophobic atmosphere, giving the
  audience a sense of entrapment and anxiety which served to
  heighten the suspense regarding the possibility of impending
  doom. Then the filmmakers introduce a fact that I felt completely
  derailed the movie, this is a cave that no one has been in, and
  these girls are hardly professional. So, who in their right mind
  would put all of their friends lives in possible jeopardy just to
  be the first to explore a newly discovered cave. It's absolutely
  stupid, especially when placed viewed in the context of the
  character's interaction and companionship with each other, none
  of these girls would do this to each other. After this occurs the
  mutants show up, a plot point that I was hoping would help put
  the movie back in the right direction; however, this is where the
  movie begins to unwind even faster, because it's now just one
  gory scene after another, and the movie is nothing more than your
  average monster movie. A decision I somewhat agreed with, yet
  still didn't agree with was the decision to keep the mutants
  origins unknown. On the one hand this served to add to the
  mystery of why they are attacking these girls, you just assume
  they're cannibalistic, but on the other it would have been nice
  to know how they got there. Even though "The Descent" was hyped
  as being one of the best horror movies of recent time, by both my
  friends and many critics and moviegoers, to me it was merely
  another average addition to a genre that is already full of
  mediocrity. "The Descent" is unrated and contains violence and
  language</Text>

  this... But just wait for the next record when you'll get
  &amp;amp;quot;Hold On Loosely!&amp;amp;quot</Text>
  <Text category="music">I am completly shocked at how high the scores
  for this album are on amazon. Trust me, I am not someone who
  claims to be a music expert, but I am a big fan of Jam/Funk and
  Jazz fusion. I play bass, I understand music, and Umphrey's is
  among my favorite bands (others include 311, Widespread Panic,
  Deep Banana Blackout, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Soulive, Medeski
  Martin Wood). In general I am open to all kinds of funky music,
  and Umphrey's usually puts out. In my opinion, this band had the
  talent and unique sound to become the next generation of funk
  (following the Red Hot Chili Peppers and 311). With this album I
  was expecting them to develop their sound from Anchor Drops into
  an album that could achieve mainstream success like RHCP's Blood
  Sex Sugar Magic did, while staying true to their unique roots in
  Jazz, blues, rock and even some metal. Like I said, they fuse
  genres like no one else can...THIS album, however, was a complete
  failure in the areas I have described above. First off, I can
  understand how reviewers point to the production quality, and the
  musical talent displayed throughout the album. Umphreys Mcgee is
  insanely talented, and no effort could hide that from the
  listener. HOWEVER, to be blunt this album is boring as hell, has
  no funk or rock in it period, and is frankly somewhat depressing.
  IF your expecting wild guitar improv, explosive beats and fun,
  uplifting music--ignore this album. If you are a fan of Umphrey's
  live show and their past albums--ignore this album. If you tend
  to be willing to overlook production quality in search of
  funkier, jazzier guitar rifs and bass experimentation--do not buy
  this album. The only way I can summate this album is that its a
  typical indy type album. Slow songs without enough music, little
  variance from song to song, depressing lyrics, and a slow pace.
  Some say this is Umphreys showing their full range, I say this is
  them bottling up their range in a more mainstream package that is
  not all that enjoyable. The only reason I wrote this review is
  that Im amazed by the other reviews on this page. I wish I had
  never heard this album, it is a pathetic effort from a band as
  experimental and fun as Umphreys Mcgee. They missed a golden
  opportunity to come out with the next great funk compilation,
  this album is a step in the wrong direction. I strong advise the
  listener who likes to be entertained by music, rather than
  production quality and introspective lyrics, to steer way clear
  of this album. This was a massive dissappointment beyond any
  album release I have ever heard (including By the Way from RHCP,
  which is an achievement in musical creativity compared to Safety
  in Numbers)</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This video's only redeeming quality is its
  excellent pilates instruction. Like all Stott videos this one
  takes extra care to explain proper form and technique.
  Unfortunately, the aerobics portion is extremely boring and
  simple. You just walk in place the whole time with no interesting
  variations. If you are looking for a video for a beginner, this
  one might work for you if you are truly new to exercise and are
  REALLY out of shape. Although I consider myself a beginner when
  it comes to exercise, this video was too easy for me. I haven't
  exercised consistently in several years. However, I do have a
  moderately active lifestyle. I walk and hike on occassion and I
  play with my kids at the park--that sort of thing. If you have
  trouble with everyday activities because you are out of shape,
  this would be a great place to start. If you are somewhat fit,
  this video might be too easy for you as well. You might also like
  this video if you feel like you have no coordination. There are
  no fancy moves at all. If you can walk, you can do this video. I
  like simple steps, but this was too simple. In general, though, I
  think you'd be better off saving your money and taking a walk.
  Spend your money on one of the other excellent Stott videos that
  focuses exclusively on pilates</Text>

  <Text category="book">The book starts off ok with a good
  introduction of the various API's and is ok reading up untill
  chapter 6 "Programming Linux Audio". This is where the book fails
  terribly. None of the audio samples will compile and the
  information about OpenAL is just plain wrong. First the function
  used to open a WAV file is no the corerct function to use for
  linux. The author uses the win32 version. This is just the start
  of the openAL errors. Minus one star! Second the book's two
  websites (one of which no longer exists (Loki) ) contains no
  errata and no way to contact the author. The only information is
  avalible is a zip file of the books sample files (which do not
  compile of course). Minus two stars! Ohter things about the book
  that did not work for me was the fact that the author uses C
  instead of C++. While C is still used for game development , most
  programmers are attempting to migrate to C++ and OOD. Books
  released about 1950 should reflect that! Second the author uses
  Tcl as a game scripting engine. While I can agree to a point
  (based on the fact of the easy of implementation) the author
  should have used a common scripting engine such as Lua. (although
  the author does mention at the end of the book that Tcl was
  proably a bad idea. Third the author should have introduced
  Autoconf very early in the book instead of waiting untill Chapter
  10. The main thing that I liked about the book was the good intro
  to programming with Linux in general. The topics of linux
  debugging and Makefiles I thought was good (assuming you have
  experince in these areas on other platfoms). Also the coverage of
  SDL was a pretty good intro.</Text>
  <Text category="book">I too read the TA for Tots to my 3-5 year-old
  30 years ago. She loved it a lot so I've been looking for it
  again, this time for my grand-daughter. Even though the title is
  different from the original one I knew, I purchased it and read
  it as soon as I received it. Bottomline: this story is _not_ the
  original one and I don't like it at all. Other than showing
  stereotypical Happy Prince and Princess fairy tale characters
  (which I can live with up to a point), I saw bunches of red flags
  when I got to the evil witch, drawn with a full-blown ugly face
  "who was very clever and devised a very wicked plan". Unhappy
  because there are so many happy warm-fuzzy people around she
  freely starts giving away cold pricklies. Without enough warm
  fuzzies (we read earlier) it puts people "in danger of developing
  a sickness in their backs which caused them to shrivel up and
  die". Ouch. So instead of embracing the wisdom of old women, here
  we have another story that villifies them (OK, I'm a
  psychotherapist also and know all too well how these images
  affect us all). No, it's not funny, and there is no way I would
  introduce this book to any child. The book also does not do a
  good job of showing clear examples of what warm fuzzies and cold
  pricklies really are, as the original book did. Too bad, for
  using images of "warm fuzzies" and "cold pricklies" is an easy
  way to introduce feelings and consequences of behaviors to young
  children. I am returning the book.</Text>
  <Text category="book">Having just read the book (most highly
  recommended) I decided to treat myself to the movie. I could have
  cried. While I did not expect the movie to contain everything
  from the book, I was sadly dissapointed to see that it totally
  changed the plot around. In the book, the 5 men bonded together
  and were great men of character. In the movie, they got rid of
  one man, had the other eaten right off the bat, Pencroft is shown
  to be a coward and greedy. In the book, Nemo appears only in the
  last two or three chapters, and he does not have an elaborate
  home on the island. And what about those stupid giant animals? I
  don't recall reading about them. The fence around Nemo's home
  looks like it came right from Jurassic Park. The whole story was
  about 5 (eventually 6) men who were stranded on an uncharted
  island and the wonderful adventures they had there. On another
  note, the graphics were pretty bad. The panning was very blurry
  and the picture was often grainy. As one reviewer well said, it
  is suitable for children who are easily pleased, but it is
  nothing like the book. Perhaps this is why Amazon sells it for
  only $6.99</Text>
  <Text category="book">"The Other Boleyn Girl" and "The Queen's Fool"
  are two of the best books I've ever read--and I've read a LOT of
  books, especially about this period, which especially fascinates
  me. They were gripping to the end, and my involvement with the
  characters was complete--true masterpieces. So whenever a new
  book by Philippa Gregory comes out, I buy it, hoping to have the
  same experience, and lately have been sorely disappointed. "The
  Virgin's Lover" fell flat, and now I am trying to read this book
  but not finding myself engaged, must give it up. One reviewer
  suggested the books were being written too quickly--that is
  always an easy guess, however it depends on the writer. Anthony
  Trollope, for instance, was able to turn out amazing book after
  amazing book with incredible speed. That may or may not be the
  case with Gregory. I know, as a writer myself, that there are
  times when the work flows out, feeling almost as if it's
  channeled from another source, and times when it's harder, more
  mechanical. The more challenging situations are those when I'm
  not entirely convinced or in love with my subject. So to me,
  neither of these books feels as if they spring from a natural
  impulse. They feel forced, constructed. I'm going back to
  Trollope</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Incredible does describe this movie-
  incredibly bad! This movie doesn't know what it wants to be. At
  times one can see attempts to recreate and milk the genuine rage
  and drama of "Mississippi Burning" or the anger and impunity of
  "Ghosts of Mississippi", or a hybrid of those and bits and pieces
  of other movies of this genre. At other times it looks like its
  just trying to draw from the sex appeal and cheesy interaction of
  2 of its main actors, Matthew McConaughey and Sandra Bullock. As
  a result this movie picks up the rear in that genre's list of
  movies for lack of originality, and the scattered hodge podge
  statements it tries to make. Some of my favorite actors are
  wasted, either by being given cliched dialogue, over acting, or
  being put there merely for their brand name with no script to
  support their presence. If this script is considered a great
  adaptation of a great book, then I have no interest in reading
  the book. I'm sure the idea and the premise looked good on paper.
  But the direction doesn't guide the story with any coherence or
  identity of its own. Bullock is mere cheesecake and is
  unbelievable in her role, proving she's only worthy of b-grade
  "Miss Congeniality" type crud. McConaughey over acts so much (as
  can be said for Keifer Sutherland and others) that it can be said
  he balances out the under acting of Patrick McGoohan, Kevin
  Spacey and Donald Sutherland. Samuel L. Jackson should be ashamed
  of himself of not only his worst performance ever, but also
  easily his worst choice of movies to participate in. Even the
  extras in this movie are horrible. Enough can't be said about the
  terrible direction in this movie, equating elongated facial shots
  with drama to a fault, making Sergio Leone westerns look much
  more authentic by comparison. This is not "a powerful film." It's
  a powerful attempt at using a big name cast, a brand name book
  and a capable director to use material that they know would
  easily jerk the emotions of its audience, and in doing that they
  resort to all the cliches of this genre scattering the story line
  in so many directions, culminating in an over the top, pleading
  hunk of cheese summation scene by McConaughey that wouldn't hold
  water in any real court of justice. Maybe people claim greatness
  to this movie out of guilt, or because they haven't seen quality
  comparisons and classics like "Mississippis Burning," that has
  both a great script and fabulous acting. I don't know. All I know
  is it tugs from so many hokey directions it takes the final scene
  to remind everyone how it started. Among the top of my most over
  rated movies</Text>

  <Text category="book">While some critics can argue with Dan Brown's
  research and reasoning on certain historical points, one thing
  these Da Vinci "debunking" presentations will never be able to
  refute is this: the downplaying of the feminine role in western
  civilization and Christianity, primarily by the Catholic Church,
  and the fact that the Church still considered Mary Magdalene a
  common prostitute until just a few short years ago: 1969. Nor is
  it possible to refute the recent polymorphously perverse scandals
  that have rocked the Church after centuries of suppression and
  may have everything to do with the doctrinal distortions that Dan
  Brown has brought out in the open for serious review. This
  institution is in trouble because it is seriously out of balance
  with itself and has cut off its spiritual nose to despite its
  face by downplaying or denigrating the role of women as sacred
  beings and bearers of the Light, when their healthy presence is
  needed more than ever as a corrective to some of these abuses and
  scandals. Dan Brown has done the world a great service by showing
  how the feminine role in the divine was written out 2000 years
  ago, with help from Peter whose misogynistic views of women are
  plainly evident in the scriptures even today and are still, quite
  frankly, shocking and debasing. Sorry, but upon this "Rock" of
  male dominancy was built the Church. Thank you again, Dan Brown,
  by bringing these matters into the light of day so people can
  know more of their authentic history or at least do their own
  research to make up their own minds about which spiritual path is
  best for them and which ones were built on two millenniums worth
  of manipulations, obscurations and lies. These obscurations and
  lies happened through the efforts of a group of petty, insecure
  and misguided men down through the centuries to ensure their
  dominance and control over the masses, and they found a way to
  dominate not only the minds of the masses but their vast material
  resources, worth trillions, through guilt, control and other
  hidden but consistent abuses of power. And those of orthodox
  faith who continue to blindly support such hypocritical
  institutions have a lot more to answer for than any twenty Dan
  Browns put together. People are angry and they are angry at the
  failure of religion to live up to its own standards of behavior
  and for distorting what may have been Jesus' actual relationship
  with the women in his life--or were the disciples just supposed
  to be members of a exclusive Men's Club with Jesus as head and
  women as a species relegated to second class citizenship? To
  answer these questions, some of you will finally have to turn to
  your own heart and mind for a change instead of some literal
  interpretation of the truth, because not everything of the light
  is found in scriptures or on the printed page, especially after
  the scriptures have been selectively riddled with scissors for
  reasons of self-interest or from spiritual corruption. The next
  thing people should ask for is to have the vaults of the Vatican
  thrown open for public view. Lord only knows what plunder they
  contain</Text>

  <Text category="book">Paul Ehrlich may understand butterflies more
  than most of us do, but he definitely does not understand how the
  real world in general and the human society in particular works.
  He just does not seem to have sufficiently organized brain cells
  to think realistically about the world. This book starts with the
  bold statement that "he had understood the population explosion
  for quite some time". Nevertheless, the whole book proves that
  it's not the case. All his reasoning is based on the worst
  possible extrapolation of the worst imaginable short-term trend.
  His assumptions therefore include the "intelligent" assumption
  that there won't ever be any technological progress in the
  future; the climate will evolve in the worst possible way, and so
  forth. It's not surprising that he predicted that there would be
  mass starvation in the U.S. in the 1980s, and even when this was
  shown to be complete nonsense, he repeated the same prediction
  for the 1990s. Why does he - and people like him - continue to
  produce predictions that have been humiliated so many times by
  the actual course of history? It's because of their religion.
  Maybe they don't call it a "religion", but it is a religion
  nevertheless. Jehovah's Witnesses typically believe that there is
  going to be a judgement day. Because it did not occur in 1918 and
  other years for which it was predicted, they are a bit more
  careful and vague in their predictions nowadays. Malthus had done
  very similar errors as Ehrlich, but you may think that in the
  20th century, people could know more than Malthus knew many years
  ago. But Ehrlich does not know more. In some sense, even Karl
  Marx himself could be viewed as a producer of catastrophic
  predictions. Marx predicted that something wrong would occur with
  capitalism as such, and it would be globally replaced by
  communism. (This is what I call a truly catastrophic prediction.)
  Marx was wrong, of course, because he completely misunderstood
  the magic power of the society and of the market to improve
  things that need to be improved and its ability to self-regulate
  and accomodate to new conditions. Ehrlich is repeating all errors
  of Marx and many other errors, too. But other people who have a
  different kind of a religious belief that we must simply be
  approaching a judgement day can't learn from Jehovah's Witnesses
  mistakes. Of course that Paul Ehrlich's reasoning has nothing to
  do with rational approach to important questions. (Bjorn Lomborg
  may be an example of a person who tries to solve very similar
  questions - namely these speculative questions about the
  long-term food problems - rationally.) Ehrlich confuses the total
  amount of food available today and the total production of food;
  he does not understand that the efficiency of agriculture can
  increase much like the population or even more; he does not
  understand that the growth of the population in the developed
  world would be naturally reduced if it became difficult to feed
  children, and so forth. He just does not understand the
  "invisible hand" of free markets and the visible hand of
  scientific and technologica progress and the power of human
  decisions. His reasoning could easily be proved wrong if he
  simply tried to make similar predictions about the past. But it
  was not his main goal to find a realistic prediction for the
  future. His goal was to write down pseudorationally sounding
  justifications of his religious preconceptions that would impress
  many people who are not exactly smart. The similarity between
  Ehrlich's predictions of mass starvation and the recent
  predictions of catastrophic global warming is not just a
  superficial coincidence. Find the book "Boiling Point" by Ross
  Gelbspan at this website - one of the silly recent books about
  the climate change disasters that expect us. Among the 15 mostly
  positive reviews of the book, you will also find a 5-star review
  by Paul Ehrlich of Stanford himself! The global warming alarmists
  continue with the traditions of Paul Ehrlich. It is still the
  same pseudoscience and people will apparently always believe this
  kind of stuff because there are only two infinite things: the
  Universe and human stupidity, and I am not sure about the
  Universe</Text>

  <Text category="health">Have this unit in out house, we have the one
  with one base unit and two mobile units. A few things to note.
  The ones we had do not offer rechargeable batteries. It uses
  alkaline only, or if you have your own charger you could use
  rechargeable but would be nicer if it recharged while plugged in.
  We live in NYC, Queens to be exact. We hear taxi cab radio
  chatter over this at times, especially at night. Also if unit is
  close to base unit static is not too bad but still annoying in
  bedroom, BUT if you have it one floor away, forget it. Unless
  child is screaming all you hear is static. on both units. Only
  has two channels A &amp;amp; B which are set manually at both
  base and hand held units. So if you have a bad signal in middle
  of night, you have to go into child's room and change channel.
  Just don't wake the baby! Ouch! Also missing a pager and a
  "walkie talkie" feature. They would be very nice. Not a deal
  breaker if they don't have it BUT it can be handy especially if
  your two floors up with baby with a full diaper and Spouse is in
  basement and you need more diapers from Garage. I am about to
  have a second child, and I am replacing this unit with a better
  one, I am looking at one of the new digital units that have the
  noise/static reduction. Consumer Reports gave some of them their

  near $200 and only one receiver. But they all have charging bases

  have considered his movement (Christianity) a cult by definition
  and now it's the largest religious form of worship in the world.

  relationship with such relish, he sounds to me like a P.C.
  Caucasian who is drawn in patronizing fashion to the "otherness"
  of Asian people and doesn't see them for what they are, just
  wants them to appreciate big strong white man. I thought it
  interesting that in the story the woman never mentions to the man
  that she already has a young son living with her mother. So she
  was not honest with him. But Olen Butler wrote about her as if
  this stripper/pros. was wonderful, the kind of wife any man would

  <Text category="book">While my son enjoyed the illustrations anf fun
  content of the books in this set, I felt it was disappointing as
  a learning tool for beginning readers because it moves much too
  quickly. The first book is just letters and letter sounds. Very
  introductory. The second book introduces three letter words right
  off with no transition at all like 2 letter blends. That was ok
  to me since it was phonetic 3 letter words, but by page 2 we were
  already "leaping" to 4 and 5 letter words and by page 3 they were
  already introducing a sight word - "does" and a double consonant
  word - "cannot". I thought the pace was frustrating for my son. I
  was hoping/expecting a book devoted to just blends and/or 3
  letter words. Instead this program is organized by vowels with
  the letter a being introduced first. I don't see that as a
  problem, but I was expecting more phonetic 3 letter words to
  start and introducing harder 4 and 5 letter words by maybe book 3
  and sight words coming later, like maybe book 4. Unfortunately,
  you can't see exactly what your getting until you open the box.

  <Text category="dvd">Denzel Washington is probably my favorite
  actor. Even in that dog of a movie called THE MANCHURIAN
  CANDIDATE, he shone. Tom Hanks? Well, lemme quit hating the guy.
  This is a well-intentioned movie, Tom did a creditable job, and
  we had extreme close-ups with funny colors to camouflage the
  spots where he overreached. I was also pleasantly surprised to
  see Antonio Banderas fly in the face of his Latino studliness by
  playing a gay guy. A passionate one, though, since he's still a
  Latino, after all. Actually, this is a Hollywood "message movie,"
  and you know what that means. It's about as subtle as Michael
  Moore. Those who agree with the message flock to be beaten about
  the head by it for two hours. Those who the filmmakers would like
  to see the movie, those who don't agree with the message, stay as
  far away from it as possible. There's a scene in the library
  where nobody wants to sit at the table with AIDS boy. The way
  they stared at him reminded me of "lao wei in China" experiences.
  Denzel's character was reminded of segregation, even though he's
  too young to remember it, and started to care about Tom Hanks'
  character. AIDS discrimination is bad. Actually, any
  discrimination at all is bad. And that's the movie's message. I
  agree with the message, but still. That's all we've got. As a
  totally irrelevant non-sequiter, if the name "Sam Francisco"
  means anything to you, you've seen subtle commentary on
  discrimination. I love a great courtroom drama. This one was
  merely good. With so much of an agenda to squeeze into a two-hour
  film, they had to take a few shortcuts here. Sad, ain't it? But
  even so, a well-intentioned film that I'm glad I saw. Once. Not
  twice. Once is enough, thank you.</Text>

  comedian and that's his problem, if he was truly edgy he wouldn't
  have to constantly remind us in his CD/DVD titles, his show on
  Comedy Central, radio/TV interviews and most importantly during
  his own act. Sure he talks about very racial and socially taboo
  subjects but so does Chris Rock, George Lopez, David Cross,
  George Carlin, Dave Chappelle, Richard Pryor (RIP) and countless
  other comedians and they are much better at it. In fact they are
  so good at it Mr. Mencia often feels to need to use some of these
  comedian's jokes in his own act, a true sign of respect for those
  who came before them; at least that's what Carlos seems to think
  or maybe he's just plagiarizing because he's not funny enough to
  come up with descent material. Needless to say I was not laughing
  while listening to this CD and it wasn't because I find Carlos to
  mean spirited, or crass, or politically incorrect; it's because
  everything he talks about that's supposed to be so gosh darn edgy

  <Text category="dvd">This movie had many of the ingredients to make
  it truly great, including a phenomenal cast, lead by Cate
  Blanchett, and great scenery and cinematography. The actors
  playing Elizabeth, Cecil, and Walsingham spoke and acted
  admirably, each phrase spoken with such honesty and feeling, but
  the words themselves rendered the performances useless. The
  director and the author of the script greatly misunderstood the
  characters and the material. They should have read Elizabeth the
  First's biography by Elizabeth Jenkins. It is useless to say a
  movie does not need to be historically accurate but has only to
  entertain: had the author and director been more historically
  accurate, they would not have created the unbelievable character
  they created in Elizabeth, who is in turn hysterical, defeatist,
  overbearing, childish, tyrannical, who never shows her core
  intelligence, her great love of her people, who had a private
  core described by her motto "Semper Eadem", be always one.
  Elizabeth ruled with her advisors, she was not totally ruled by
  them. She would not have put up with Norfolk screaming at her
  across the council table, nor would Burleigh have allowed it.
  Cate Blanchett's wonderful acting and presence were pearls thrown
  before swine, wasted on a character portrayal that totally lacked
  any integrity, much less truth. How could the director think that
  the woman he was trying to portray was any kind of real woman?
  The ending had me blushing with embarassment for one and all. We
  are laughably given William Cecil as wimpy and ineffective, and
  Walsingham as the mastermind behind the throne. One of the
  reviews said that the director inspired Rush to play Walsingham
  much like the Hindu god Krishna. I suggest that he should have
  first read some English history</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">Incredible does describe this movie-
  incredibly bad! This movie doesn't know what it wants to be. At
  times one can see attempts to recreate and milk the genuine rage
  and drama of "Mississippi Burning" or the anger and impunity of
  "Ghosts of Mississippi", or a hybrid of those and bits and pieces
  of other movies of this genre. At other times it looks like its
  just trying to draw from the sex appeal and cheesy interaction of
  2 of its main actors, Matthew McConaughey and Sandra Bullock. As
  a result this movie picks up the rear in that genre's list of
  movies for lack of originality, and the scattered hodge podge
  statements it tries to make. Some of my favorite actors are
  wasted, either by being given cliched dialogue, over acting, or
  being put there merely for their brand name with no script to
  support their presence. If this script is considered a great
  adaptation of a great book, then I have no interest in reading
  the book. I'm sure the idea and the premise looked good on paper.
  But the direction doesn't guide the story with any coherence or
  identity of its own. Bullock is mere cheesecake and is
  unbelievable in her role, proving she's only worthy of b-grade
  "Miss Congeniality" type crud. McConaughey over acts so much (as
  can be said for Keifer Sutherland and others) that it can be said
  he balances out the under acting of Patrick McGoohan, Kevin
  Spacey and Donald Sutherland. Samuel L. Jackson should be ashamed
  of himself of not only his worst performance ever, but also
  easily his worst choice of movies to participate in. Even the
  extras in this movie are horrible. Enough can't be said about the
  terrible direction in this movie, equating elongated facial shots
  with drama to a fault, making Sergio Leone westerns look much
  more authentic by comparison. This is not "a powerful film." It's
  a powerful attempt at using a big name cast, a brand name book
  and a capable director to use material that they know would
  easily jerk the emotions of its audience, and in doing that they
  resort to all the cliches of this genre scattering the story line
  in so many directions, culminating in an over the top, pleading
  hunk of cheese summation scene by McConaughey that wouldn't hold
  water in any real court of justice. Maybe people claim greatness
  to this movie out of guilt, or because they haven't seen quality
  comparisons and classics like "Mississippis Burning," that has
  both a great script and fabulous acting. I don't know. All I know
  is it tugs from so many hokey directions it takes the final scene
  to remind everyone how it started. Among the top of my most over

  <Text category="health">I'd give this machine 5 stars if #1)it wasn't
  so expensive and #2), it wasn't so darn small. It barely fits
  anything inside. It works well for pacifiers and a rattle or two,
  but that's about it. Anything else just won't fit. And the design
  of the inside, with the piece in the middle, makes it even more
  restricting. In my personal opinion, this product is not worth
  the money. I am so disappointed, because it sounded so perfect.

  <Text category="health">I have three bathrooms used by two teenagers
  and their friends, a toddler and her friends and so they need
  heavy duty cleaning every week. A neighbour suggested the Mr
  Clean to me saying it really cut down on her cleaning time and
  she didn't have to wreck her back scrubbing the tub. I am
  disappointed with it. The one thing I did like was the pole. I
  was able to scrub the tub, the tile on the walls without needing
  to overreach. That said, I really had to scrub hard to get the
  grime off the tub, and still couldn't get it all until I used my
  regular scrub brush. I think I was expecting this to be a way
  that I could do a lighter clean in between the heavy duty ones
  but obviously not so. The other thing that bothered me was that
  you have to RINSE off the stuff after you scrub; from watching
  the commercial I feel misled because you get the impression that
  you just scrub and you're done. At least it wasn't that spendy so
  I don't feel too bad about the wasted money</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I bought a couple of Bob vidoes through Amazon
  for my son, age nearly 2, who loves the series. We were

  replaced by American voices. WHY do they do that? For us it means
  the videos are unplayable because they just ain't Bob. British

  <Text category="music">A lot of people are meriting Ja's credibility
  on all his albums because he has been able to keep his voice on
  the airwaves since 1998. So he released his sophomore album Rule
  3:36 in Sept 2000, that is one of the worst Ja albums I've heard
  (not the worst, The Last Temptation takes that title). Ja tries
  to be "gangstafied" on this album but fails terribly. Starting
  with the first single "Me &amp;amp; You" thinking his thug style
  can attract women. I haven't bought the concept in 2000, and I'm
  still not buying it six years later. Or how about the flat
  falling track "F*** You" featuring Vita and 01? Or as many
  revewers have pointed out that he tries to boast his singing
  vocals on this album, which seriously damages his creditablity.
  How about the song "Put It On Me" before Lil Mo joined song.
  Sounds wack(er) with out her. Or how about the late Barry White
  imitation on the song "Extacy" (and thats one of the decent
  tracks on this album). Oh and remember when "Between Me &amp;amp;
  You" was highly antacipated that you downloaded the single on
  Napster? Well do you remember that the origonal/demo that some of
  you downloaded didn't have Christina Millian singing the hook,
  but had Ja singing it himself. Thank god that wasn't on the
  album. Now there are some listenable tracks on this album that I
  would like to point out. "6 Feet" is a standout track, and is
  possibly the best track on this album and my personal favorite.
  "Watching Me" is another tight track, as Ja spits with a load of
  energy within him. "I Cry" and as mentioned earlier "Extacy" are
  decent at best. Other than that, most of the tracks on this album
  are skippable. Overall, a sub medicore Ja Rule album. Most of the
  4 and 5 star reviewers are either big time Ja Rule fans or just
  in love with mainstream overrated rap ("Put It On Me" [Remix]).
  To me, this album is nothing else but a pop rap, falsafied thug
  rap album that just doesn't appeal to me. I recommend this to
  hardcore Ja Rule fans if they don't have this already. Lyrics: C

  <Text category="dvd">I read all 33 of the other reviews here to get
  other perspectives - a lively debate. There were so many
  brilliant things said about the film, that I found myself passing
  out "Helpful" votes (to both positive &amp;amp; blisteringly
  negative reviews) like they were candy. The movie is an evocative
  work of art. I encourage people to read all the reviews if they
  want to enjoy the movie from many different points of view. I
  agree with many of the positive and negative comments that have
  been made by other reviewers, but I will limit my comments to
  items not previously mentioned. The DVD cover gives the false
  impression that this is a love story about two young lovers, a
  sort of "Blue Lagoon" from the Renaissance. It is not. It is
  misleading. I concede a) the story is probably not historically
  accurate, b) statutory rape occurred and probably rape under any
  definition, &amp;amp; c) Tossi was probably inconsiderate,
  conceited, and immoral. But the quality of a film is not judged
  solely on historical accuracy and the high morality of the
  characters. Having said that, I do object that the movie,
  according to the rape trial transcript and some of the best
  evidence available, is not just inaccurate, but oppositional to
  what probably occurred. Therefore, I critique the film for
  portraying itself as the story of a real person. The movie
  stumbles internally because it tries to justify actual historical
  effects with fictional (or incorrect) causal factors. And those
  cause-effect relationships don't seem to ring true. Having said
  that, I agree with some of Richard Burt's review comments that
  "historical accuracy" may still be subject to interpretation. It
  is reasonable that Artemisia may have been more adversarial
  speaking in a public rape trial (defending her freedom and
  reputation) than she might have been with Tassi personally. And
  it seems too easy to just paint Tassi as a purely evil character
  as other reviewers have done. There is usually more complexity
  and diverse/conflicting interests in most people, especially
  artists. One strong objection - near the end of the film,
  Artemisia says, "No one dies of sorrow." While there is probably
  some intended sarcasm in the comment, the line frustrated me.
  People DO die of sorrow. My limited experience has suggested that
  some of the smartest, most sensitive, artistic, and caring people
  I've encountered were the same people most threatened by sorrow.
  And the people I have admired the most are the same people who
  have been mortally threatened by sorrow. Not selfish,
  controlling, or passive-aggressive sorrow, but rather sorrow that
  comes from other less obvious motivations - often unidentified
  &amp;amp; misunderstood misconceptions. Sorrow can lead to
  literal death and deaths of the spirit, character, the soul,
  &amp;amp; creativity. Sorrow is not incidental. Sorrow can
  destroy health. Or as the Angel of America in "Angels in America"
  says, "The body is the garden of the soul." Sorrow is worth full
  attention. The movie tries to examine the effect of Artemisia's
  loyalties to her father and her teacher. The screenwriter is not
  bent on us assessing those relationships as simply "good" or
  "bad"; both relationships are drawn as having both good or bad
  effects on Artemesia. Her loyalties encourage her artistry and
  her expression. They work to create an environment that does not
  inhibit or conceal her gifts. At the same time, they are so
  intrusive that they almost certainly affect her choices, privacy,
  and pacing beyond her desired level of influence. Artemisia
  realizes she would probably not be the painter she becomes except
  for her father's drive and design. At the same time, she also
  laments that his constant intervention narrowed the occupations
  she could participate in - in polite society. May your loyalties
  encourage seeking and speaking the best personal truths you can
  find. And may the best personal truths you can find shape your
  loyalties. Compare Caravaggio's "Judith Beheading Holofernes" to
  Artemisia's version of the same painting. Her version is more
  violent, realistic (less idealized in posing, dirtiness,
  lighting, etc.). Her version has the female servant actively
  helping Judith. Artemisia's paintings show a palpable
  understanding of hate, violence, sexuality &amp;amp; compassion.
  Artemisia likely became expressive of the personal feelings and
  experiences she knew best. That's why people care about whether a
  movie about her life characterizes her experiences accurately -
  because we want to know what led her to her creative
  decisions</Text>

  soon become intertwined in their quest for the secrets of Sigma,
  an elite cabal with roots in Nazi Germany that is bent on world
  domination. What starts out as reasonable and entrancing enough
  genre pulp becomes sheer Bond by the end, but there's no denying
  Ludlum has a gift for keeping the heat turned up from page to
  page. If you are new to espionage fiction and have even slightly
  literary sensibilities, run don't walk to writers like Alan
  Furst, Graham Greene, or even John Le Carrï¿½. But
  if strong characters aren't a necessity, you are able to suspend
  your disbelief, and you are lusting for pure literary sugar, you
  probably won't be disappointed. Ludlum is a great author for
  those who typically spend hours in front of the television and
  tremble in anticipation at the release of the next Hollywood
  blockbuster, because he provides essentially the same experience
  in written form. He is a master of the wildly oscillating plot
  line, but barely approaches apprentice status in any other
  literary area. I found myself cringing in embarrassment for the
  author at many points, but to his credit I was compelled to
  continue turning the pages until I had reached the end. It's like
  candy, you can't stop eating it but feel ill once it's gone. If
  you are a die hard Ludlumite I admit this is my first foray.
  Please point me to a better example of his work if one exists,

  <Text category="book">The author is a sociologist and tells of

  learn anything new from this book. It has a long list of books on
  the subject, but the author gave no ratings or summaries on them.
  Were they all equal in quality? The OJ case received more
  publicity than the Oklahoma City bombing or the Clinton
  impeachment. The National Association of Editors and Publishers
  has never told of the reasons for its play in the news. Could it
  have been intended as a distraction from other news? In May 1994
  the newspapers carried stories on how North Korea was ready to
  attack and start a war; this was repeated weekly. In 1999 I read
  that President Carter had been sent on a diplomatic mission to
  North Korea (must have been a success, since the propaganda
  stopped). Could the double murders in Brentwood have been
  well-publicized as a distraction? Isn't two murders a day the
  usual LA statistics? How many other waiters (just from Mezzaluna)
  were murdered each year? Are murders by organized crime often
  solved? The book "Killing Time" noted that restaurants and health
  clubs (in LA and elsewhere) were often used a fronts for drug
  dealing and prostitution. If this explains the murders, you won't
  find much in this book. [My experience is that most white
  Americans made up their minds in June 1994 and never let the new

  <Text category="book">The author of this book, Warren Wagar, is
  apparently a professor of "Future Studies." I certainly hope he
  has long been fired from that post. "A Short History of the
  Future" was written in 1989, but the writer is so ignorant of
  politics, and so WRONG, to be blunt, it reads as if it was
  written in the 1940's. Orwell's 1984 is more on the mark than
  this. He shows barely any creativity in his "predictions" and
  clearly was barely even aware of much of the contemporary
  political developments of his time. The fact that he assumes the
  Soviet Union will continue plodding along well into the 21st
  Century is incredibly naive. The fact that he assumes the
  nation's socialist economy system would survive equally long is
  similarly bizarre. Did he read the newspapers? Did he pay ANY
  attention to that Gorbachev fellow and the path he was bringing
  Russia down? And honestly, did anyone really expect that Germany
  would remain divided into two states until time immortal? Or that
  Latin America and Africa would remain dictatorships forever? Or
  that black rule in South Africa would not occur until 2014? If
  this book had been written 30 or 40 ago, it would be excusable.
  This book is just sloppy. He doesn't even do a good job
  describing how his corporations take over the world. Everything
  is just described in these overly flowery sweeping
  generalizations. Like "and then the capital lords seized control
  of the governments and made the state wither like an autumn
  rose." That sort of thing. The author is clearly an "ivory tower"
  academic who believes history can be predicted sorely through dry
  Marxist theory and analyzing dubious vague "trends." The fact
  that this book became horribly dated something like three years
  after it was published is quite a strong indictment of a man
  whose entire job was devoted to predicting the future.</Text>

  <Text category="toys_games">Just like a big chunk of us right now, I'm
  quite the sudoku addict. I just can't put those little puzzles
  down! So, I have to tell you first, if you haven't worked sudoku
  puzzles yet, you are really missing out! Get your hands on some!
  Naturally, I was excited to try out a sudoku game and race
  against my friends to solve the puzzles. But what a
  disappointment! One small board, several people straining to see
  it, everyone racing to fill in the puzzle...it just doesn't work.
  The way they designed this game was to have a board, which is the
  puzzle to be solved, and number tiles that you distribute evenly
  amongst the players. Everyone rushes to fill in the puzzle, and
  the person who uses all their number tiles first is the winner,
  assuming the puzzle is solved correctly. First of all, if you
  have more than 2 people playing, the players aren't all going to
  be able to see the board well. Some people are going to have the
  board upside-down trying to solve it. That's rough! Talk about
  getting confused between 6s and 9s! Plus, everyone's hands are in
  the way while they're laying their tiles, which makes it really
  hard to see and concentrate on the puzzle. Next, inevitably in
  the games I've played someone lays a tile wrong. Then the whole
  game is thrown off. The instructions say that if someone rids
  themselves of their tiles but placed them incorrectly, then the
  next person to finish would win provided all their tiles are
  correct. Most likely, if one person has made an error, that will
  have caused a chain reaction and the next person's tiles will
  also be placed wrong, and not necessarily by fault of either of
  the players. It could have been anyone who started the chain
  reaction. The format just doesn't work for this game. My advice
  is to pass on this particular game. Perhaps a game where people
  were racing side-by-side on the same puzzle, but with their own
  puzzle, would work better</Text>

  <Text category="toys_games">The pedometer arrive held prisoner in a
  difficult-to-open plastic cell -- what are these "packaging
  engineers" thinking? It took me ten minutes and two ruined
  fingernails to open it, and then I took the scissors to it, and
  the hard packaging almost broke them! But I was thrilled. A
  handsome object, thought I, and I loved the clip in the back that
  you pinch to open. So much better than having to wrestle it down
  over a soft waistband. I yanked out the plastic battery protector
  and set to work to rev the thing up to speed. But, alas, it would
  not follow instructions as they were written. "Press and hold the
  Set button. Hour display blinking." (Could they not have said,
  "The hour display will blink"? I pressed. "Press Memory button to
  adjust the hour." I did. The Memory button never did a thing. So
  I asked a friend of mine to try and he had no luck either. We
  both tried several combinations of maneuvers, but nothing worked.
  To this moment, the hour display is blinking, blinking, blinking.
  I'd like to get my money back, but ya know what? J &amp;amp; R
  Music &amp;amp; Computer World in NY demand such a rigamarole to
  send it back, including with all the original packaging (I threw
  the OP in the trash), that you almost have to be a genius in

  <Text category="book">I read this book with an open mind. I am
  familiar with the tremendous criticism that has arisen from
  claims that survivors of child abuse may use their backgrounds to
  claim some sort of privileged status. In a few cases, I think
  this criticism may be legitimate; in other cases, not. So I was
  interested to see if there were perhaps legitimate reasons to
  criticize survivors of the Holocaust or their advocates in the
  Jewish community. (Note: I am not equating child abuse and the
  Holocaust. I am saying that when people speak up about terrible
  things, there is often a tendency to see them as whiners who are
  shirking their responsibilities. All things do not have to be
  equally terrible to promote this societal reaction.) I didn't
  find anything in this book to convince me of that. What I found
  was to me an unconvincing and highly subjective summary of the
  Jewish reaction to the Holocaust, in which the author claims that
  it did not become a big deal until a long time after it was over,
  and that it was made into a big deal for illegitimate reasons,
  but this discussion is so subjective and brief that I was not
  persuaded to adopt his point of view. The bulk of the book
  consists of complaints that Jewish organizations unfairly
  extorted money from countries such as Switzerland. The argument
  becomes fairly technical here and evaluating it is beyond me
  because I have never read the reports ("audits," etc.) to which
  the author refers. But I think that focusing so narrowly on money
  misses the point. I expected to see a general discussion of the
  ways in which the author alleges that an emphasis on the
  Holocaust caused some Jews to "play the victim card," and what I
  got was a very indepth discussion of several fights about money
  about which I have no way of determining the truth of the
  author's allegations. To me it seems obvious that the Holocaust
  was a terrible atrocity with devastating consequences for the
  Jews, and many lives were destroyed or damaged as a result. It
  seems reasonable to me that the Jewish community would insist
  that society recognize the destruction and damage, and to the
  extent that this book detracts from this, I think it is
  unfortunate</Text>

  <Text category="music">Having been a casual fan of Stax records for a
  few years; I decided earlier this year that I should go all out
  and splurge on this 9-CD box set. Big mistake. I have many, many
  complaints about this set; but what it basically boils down to is
  that this whole set is an absolute mess. It misses many key
  B-sides such as Otis Redding's "Hard To Handle" and Booker T
  &amp;amp; The MG's "Tic Tac Toe"; and doesn't even include every
  a-side the label released, despite the title of the compilation
  (where are the sides that Hoyt Johnson released for the label?).
  The linear notes by Steve Greenberg (the man who gave us that
  phony "Soul Queen" Joss Stone; and the headache-inducing Baha
  Men) are horrible, mostly focusing on his personal opions of the
  artists and/or songs rather than the stories behind them. And
  within the sections for each disc in the booklet; they entries
  aren't actually arranged in any particular order (least of all
  the order of the tracks on the CDs, that would make too much
  sense). And there should've been more photos, too. Add to this
  the set's main problem: the music. The fact is that most of the
  songs on here are really lame. Seriously. "Why did you buy it,
  then?" I hear you say. Well; the Stax songs I was familiar with
  (such as "Green Onions"; "B-A-B-Y"; "You Don't Miss Your Water";
  "(Sittin' On) The Dock Of The Bay"; "Soul Man"; "Born Under A Bad
  Sign" etc) are all great songs. "Well, why don't you like this
  set then" you're thinking. Answer: because the 30-or-so great
  songs on here are sandwiched between over 200 filler songs over 9
  discs. If you think I'm being harsh on these songs, I'm not; I
  can appreciate songs like Wendy Rene's "Bar-B-Q" and the Memphis
  Nomad's "Don't Pass Your Judgement"; but aside from a few good
  numbers and a few pleasent-but-dull numbers, most of the non-hits
  on here are pretty bad. Basically, if you really like a Stax
  artist then go and buy a best-of for that artist; if your looking
  for a sampler of Stax's best songs, then go and buy the 4-CD Stax
  Story; don't bother with this one</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">Okay, the rating above is not going to be
  liked but I have to be truthful. The only good thing going for
  this movie was the return of "Snake Plissken". This film's plot
  was essentially a rehash of the original "Escape From New
  York"...A bit more special effects (which in fact, did not make
  this a better movie)... When I go to a sequel I expect to get
  what I paid for a totally new adventure with the same character /
  characters. Kurt Russell's character is older and even more in
  the know of what the rewards are before he is offered them.
  Obviously the movie doesn't really know where it's going as it
  takes two scenes (15 minutes of the film) (1st scene - President,
  Commandant, and Lackey give Snake the mission) (2nd scene -
  Commandant and Lackey brief Snake before he leaves for the
  mission) to explan to the audience what's the basic conflict. I
  guess either Carpenter or Russell are just getting too old to
  take a GREAT leap and recount either an earlier Snake Plissken
  adventure or an adventure well worth telling.. I also wish to
  comment that this disc has no special features besides a movie
  trailer... "Carpenter....Russell! " Please don't tell me "money"
  caused you to revisit a "cult figure"! Some redeeming qualities
  are the acting performances of Cliff Robertson, Stacy Keach,
  Steve Buscemi, and Pam Grier. Robertson, Keach, and Grier may be
  old but they can sure make you believe in their characters!

  <Text category="dvd">I saw this movie years ago, but didn't
  remember much about it, except some of the songs, and the basic
  story. I also saw "Nights of Cabiria", from which the story was
  taken. I love musicals, and I think Shirley MacLaine is very
  talented. She is very sweet as Charity Hope Valentine, and one
  can't help wanting a happy ending for her. So why did I think
  this movie was awful? First of all, some of the dialogue was so
  repetitious it became irritating-- how many times can you listen
  to Charity say "Fickle finger of fate" over and over without
  wanting to hit the mute button? Also, some of the scenes went on
  and on and on-- especially the elevator scene. And-- the
  intermission was totally unnecessary. But the worst
  disappointment for me was the musical numbers. I didn't like any
  of them--- they were so far over the top as to be silly. Bob
  Fosse must have thrown everything into them that he could---
  instead of letting the dancers and the songs carry the numbers,
  he had so much busyness in all of them-- too many people,
  costumes that didn't fit the story, silly moves-- and they all
  went past the point of enjoyment. I fast forwarded thru a couple
  of them just to get them over with. I have never done that before
  with any movie. This could have been so much better-- the story
  was good, the charactors were good-- but the whole thing should
  have been toned down. The movie could have been 30 minutes
  shorter if there had been some trimming. It was entirely too
  long. Also--- all that stop action-- what was that all about? I
  know, I know-- it was to show the progress of the story, but it
  was a distraction. I didn't like the movie and was glad when it
  was over.</Text>

  <Text category="book">Despite the description and synopsis on the
  books cover this is NOT a computer crime novel. In fact with the
  exception of about 20 pages total the novel quickly looses its
  snazzy cyber crime appeal. In the first few pages we're
  introduced to a dark haired female hacker but just as quickly
  she's gone and the book spirals into Japanese gangs, corrupt
  police, horribly bland and indistinguishable characters, and it
  just sucks from then on out. The story is good albeit incorrectly
  marketed. The characters however have no identity! They all sound
  the same, with the exception of the Japanese characters. Sadly
  the book lacks serious writing talent, very little character
  development, on what could've been a good story. One positive
  note perhaps is that the descriptions of Japanese culture, etc.
  are really good. Perhaps this is due to the authors departure
  many years before from England to Japan. My advice: spend some
  time abroad again</Text>
  <Text category="book">The amount of violence in this book is
  excessive over relatively insignificant motives. I had a hard
  time believing all this was happening in 1948. I am not
  questioning Mosley's portrayal of racism. However, I did a little
  research into just how violent place Los Angeles was in 1948, and
  the answer is not very. There may have been poverty, racism,
  alcholism, but L.A. county seemed pretty safe; the late 1940s had
  some of the lowest homicide rates since as far back as one
  researcher was able to find, 1827! Mosley may have been more
  familiar with L.A. of the 1970s and 1980s and just assumed that
  it had always been that way. Throw in speakeasies, gangsters
  hijacking liquor trucks, and one gets the impression that Mosley
  is confusing the 1948 with 1928. I am not so pedantic as to
  insist that fiction be historically accurate. But many, many
  people hail Mosley for depicting a dark side of life/era/place
  that had not been shown before. From what I can tell, he has
  simply combined stereotypes from the 1920s and 1970s (I guess
  those years average to be about 1948). Mosley is depicting a
  fantasy world of his own creation. However, I doubt he ever tried
  to pass it off as authentic, and I hope readers realize that it
  is not. Easy Rawlins in this novel falls into the rather weak,
  but unfortunately large, group of fictional detectives that
  actually accomplish little detecting. A detective actually solves
  a mystery using his own intellect; that is interesting to read.
  Detectives in less skilled hands solve mysteries via confession.
  Easy does solve one of the murders on his own, but just about
  everything he "solves" is simply confessed to him. I find that
  extremely dissatisfying. Mosley has packed the book with
  violence, but seems to know very little about violence himself.
  None of the fights are well described. Easy, for being a
  self-professed "killing machine" can't actually fight worth a
  damn and is surrounded by guns but does not apparently know
  anything about them. They are either big or they are small. He
  does not come of as being hard-boiled, but rather a pathetic
  braggart Mosley does show signs of being a very good writer. But
  I think he is too far over his head in this genre to come up with
  something exceptional. I imagine that his work must have
  improved, but this effort is nothing to get exceited over. And
  again, I don't obsess over accuracy, but a little bit of research
  would have gone a long way in firming the foundation of this
  novel.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">When the preview aired, I was pushing the
  movie to all my friends, based on the hilarity of the preview. At
  that time, I skeptically said, "I hope these don't turn out to be

  rest of the movie was full over overdone gross jokes, crass humor
  that went way over the line and kept running. The pee joke was
  funny once, but even at that one time they overdid it, then
  overdid it again, and then again. The Harry Potter parts were
  hilarious! Jack Sparrow was awesome! But I wished I had not been
  forced to watch the rest of the crap just to see a few funny
  parts of the movie. It's another Scary Movie (1) deal, only
  worse! I love the newest Scary Movies, they are funny, but 1
  really sucked. It was funny now and then, but a lot of it was

  <Text category="dvd">Ahh, "Iron Eagle". A classic of the 1980's
  Golan-Globus production mill. With the current spate of
  historic/"current" military movies, it's sometimes good to see
  how Hollywood's come in trying to get the details right. One
  can't do much better than using this flick as a baseline. In case
  you aren't already familiar with this gem, Louis Gosset Jr.
  playing a reserve Air Force Colonel, and a teenage kid fly a
  mission inside an unnamed Arab country -OK I'll name it: Libya-
  to rescue the kid's dad. Pop gets shot-down when he's intercepted
  in international waters, but the US refuses to do anything more
  than diplomatic pressure. The kid and Lou Gosset meet up when the
  kid's challenged to race the local bully with his PLANE while the
  bully's using his dirt bike. Suffice it to say he wins and
  impresses his babe; he doesn't get his slot at the USAF Academy,
  though. You gotta take the bad with good I guess. When the words
  on Dad get back to the family, this kid uses his base "network"
  to get access to imagery, enemy air defense data, and two F16s
  carrying a B52's worth of ordinance. All of this being done by
  his friends exploiting the dim bulbs who are their parents, no
  less. (If only strike planning was this easy.) Of course, the kid
  has flown training missions with his dad, and has a boatload of
  simulator time, so he's a natural to fly the mission. He
  convinces Gosset to go along with him, and his two-ship is on the
  way. The flying scenes are nothing spectacular, with obviously
  Israeli F16s playing the good guys, and Kfirs (modified Mirages)
  acting as MiGs. Cockpit scenes are completely the imagination of
  the set designer; I'm guessing he never was anywhere near a real
  aircraft. These are especially dated now as many computer flight
  sims are pretty darn accurate in cockpit, flight, and combat
  models. Anyway, lots of explosions on the way in, Lou gets hit
  and aborts and our hero must press on alone-go figure. He manages
  to talk with the evil dictator directly and get his dad on the
  runway for him to land (!) and pick him up. More silliness ensues
  as he launches weapons on the ground, taxi's out and takesoff. He
  kills the bad guy and heads home to find Lou punched out and was
  rescued. Rather than the prison sentence for espionage, and theft
  of government property that Lou, the kid, his pals and the idiots
  they exploited on base should've got, he gets his slot at the Air
  Force Academy. The end. Overall, I guess Lou's performance was
  fairly good, but everyone else performed at the grade-B level
  this flick is. Note especially a very young Shawnee Smith as one
  of the kid's buds. Worth seeing for laughs, and as a film version
  of a kid's pilot fantasy.</Text>

  taken to bring it to life. Like restoring a canvas where not only
  the colors and forms had faded but also sizeable parts were
  ripped off and lost, reconstructing Motezuma presents the
  challenge for the restorer of thinking and dreaming, and becoming
  as inspired as Vivaldi. In listening to Motezuma, one can pick up
  the original Vivaldian compositions from the reconstructed
  material as clear as looking at a combination painting part
  Picasso part Michelangelo. As much as such painting can be taxing
  to the eye, portions of this opera can be as disappointing to the
  ear. Except for several arias and the two sinfonias, the music
  has a touch and taste of the 1800's, but not of the baroque
  settecento. The juxtaposition of the restorative style is also
  distractive, and just does not work. It makes at times the
  orchestration devoid of the Vivaldi unf , charm, and texture.
  Nonetheless, Motezuma's musical beauty can be found in great
  arias such as D'ira e Furor Armato, La Figlia Lo Sposo,
  Gl'otraggi della Sorte, D'ove La Figlia?, S'impugni La Spada, and
  performances by Vito Priante, Inga Kalna, and Marijana Mijanovic.
  Bravo for Vito Priante and his interpretation of GI'otraggi della
  Sorte, and D'ove la Figlia. He does a great ornamentation in the
  da capos, and turns up the volume in all the right notes. Just
  like "Terribile lo Sento", and "Orribile lo Scempio",
  "GI'otraggi" shares the same musicalization. Somehow, this
  version of the score is especially more dramatic and subtlely
  more melodic.</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">My main motivation in seeing this movie was to
  better understand the reputation of Echo Park, a little area
  nestled next to downtown Los Angeles. I moved to Echo Park in
  late 2004. It's depressing - the vicious cycle of drugs,
  dropping-out, and domestic violence. And it's all here, told
  through the eyes of Latina teenagers. It was easy to see the
  woman's hand on the direction of the piece with the important
  roles that women played. I didn't care for the movie as a whole
  because it felt sluggish and uneven. I also found myself not
  caring about any of the characters. So-and-so gets shot, la la
  loo goes to jail. Whatever! As an aside, though, the evil
  neighborhood druglord was called Ernesto. It turns out my
  next-door neighbor in real-life is also called Ernesto. Luckily,

  <Text category="book">I agree with the reviewer who said this work
  is boring. It seems Roth is trying to glorify Philip Roth and not

  story or try to use less erudition in his narration. It gets to
  the point where the reader loses interest in finishing the book.

  <Text category="music">John Coltrane was villified most of his
  creative life for playing at the edge of a world he was helping
  to redefine. Wynton and the LCJO are in effect the death of
  creative musicians like Coltrane, or most of the truly creative
  Jazz scene for that matter. Wynton is establishing himself as
  "the face of Jazz". A market oriented phenomenon which freezes
  some of the elements making Jazz without ever capturing the true
  essence of the music. By telling us (and make no mistake, these
  guys do...): "this is what Jazz is" and trying to re-appropriate
  themselves the music of Jazz giants such as John Coltrane who, if
  he were alive, would not be given the time of day by these folks,
  Wynton and his posses are raping what is true and beautiful in
  this music. The recording, since I must talk about it, features a
  set of crafty yet discomboluted arrangements merely mimicking
  what Coltrane was, mostly empty of content, setting in motions
  soloists who sound more like "Jazz puppets" than anything
  remotely close to what Coltrane was striving for (notable
  exception: Ted Nash !). You do NOT need this record. Wynton and
  the LCJO does NOT need your money; spend it on musicians who put

  dog behavior. Instead, I felt I little duped. Most insight into
  dog behavior came from previous third person experiments/theories
  or anedoctal accounts of "My Friend's dog Fido, one day did
  this..." I hardly think that what one dog did can be generalized
  to the whole dog population. I mean, the author doesn't even have
  a dog!! I suspect that I, who have had a lifelong history with

  author. I don't recommend this book to all the dog lovers out

  Armstrong would sell his own grandmother's last pair of socks in

  <Text category="health">Herf applies a very simplistic test to

  background East Germany's reluctance to pay reparations to
  expropriated Jews, serves as his prime evidence for the
  continuation of things Nazi in the GDR. But both of these
  arguments completely ignore the Marxist ideology underlieing the
  rationale of the East German leadership and bypass more
  complicated issues of political allegiance. Moreover, they
  totally eclipse the East German cultural discourse on the

  <Text category="book">In 1980 Michael Weiner saw the publication of
  Weiner's Herbal: The Guide to Herb Medicine, which states the
  medical benefits of marijuana [7]. However he recently stated
  that the chemicals in marijuana make it too dangerous to be used
  as medicine. On his program, he strongly cautions against the
  recreational use of marijuana, occasionally devoting his show to
  "marijuana horror stories" and its claimed potential to ruin
  lives. He has authored a number of other books on various herbal
  medicine topics under this name. More recently, Savage's books
  are political in nature and published by WND Books, a partnership
  between the conservative website WorldNetDaily and Thomas Nelson,
  a publisher of Christian books. In January 2003 he published The
  Savage Nation: Saving America from the Liberal Assault on Our
  Borders, Language and Culture, his first book under the pseudonym
  Michael Savage. The book quickly reached the top of the New York
  Times bestseller list earning Savage, as noted above, a
  commentary show on MSNBC. The controversial book directs attacks
  at "media bias", the "dominating culture of 'she-ocracy'", gays,
  and liberals. Critics have faulted Savage for making a number of
  assertions in the book that he often fails to substantiate with
  facts or resources. Exacerbating this condition is the fact that
  the book itself has no index. The book is divided into two- to
  four-page sections, many of which are near-exact replicas to
  columns he published on the conservative site NewsMax.com. In
  January 2004, Savage published his second political book, The
  Enemy Within: Saving America from the Liberal Assault on Our
  Schools, Faith, and Military. His newest book, Liberalism is a
  Mental Disorder was released on April 12, 2005. Both of these
  books contained citations of nearly every assertion made,
  contrary to "The Savage Nation." In January 2006, Savage
  announced that he would be releasing a new book, The Political
  Zoo, in mid-March. [8] The book will contain satirical profiles
  and cartoons of different people in politics as animals in the
  "Political Zoo" including one of Savage himself, who will be
  portrayed as the zookeeper. Savage has remarked that the book
  will be "easier to digest" than his previous political books.

  Michael Alan Weiner was born to a Russian Jewish family [1] in
  the borough of The Bronx in New York City. Michael Savage earned
  a Bachelor's from Queens College in education and sociology. He
  taught high school for several years in New York City. Following
  that, he earned two Master's degrees in ethnobotany and
  anthropology from the University of Hawaii. He then received a
  Ph.D. in nutritional ethnomedicine in 1978 from the University of
  California, Berkeley. His thesis was titled Nutritional
  Ethnomedicine in Fiji. Savage spent many years researching botany
  in the South Pacific, and has a background in alternative
  medicine. He has stated he was a liberal at one time and never
  served in the military. Weiner was a friend of openly gay beat
  poet Allen Ginsberg, offering to arrange readings for Ginsberg
  and Lawrence Ferlinghetti in 1972. [2] Some of his letters to
  Ginsberg are held in Ginsberg's archives and one of those letters
  describes an encounter with a young Fijian man. [3] Savage denies
  writing the letter and called it part of a "smear campaign" by
  "gay fascists". [4] Savage also once posed naked for a photograph
  with Ginsberg while swimming in Fiji. [5] Ferlinghetti views
  Weiner's reincarnation as Michael Savage as "total opportunism,"
  the crowning achievement of someone who was "always looking to
  make a fast buck" and "always trying to think up new schemes to
  get famous." Michael Savage began his radio career in 1992 on San
  Francisco's #1 news/talk radio station KGO, first doing fill in
  work for other hosts, then getting his own show on the weekend.
  Two years later he was given a weekday show on KGO's sister
  station KSFO where he shared airtime with a liberal talk show
  host. He chose his "nom de voix" in "the Tonga Islands in the
  1960s. I stumbled upon the name of a [19th-century] shipwreck who
  was locally infamous -Charles Savage. His exploits were
  legendary," he said. "So the name was bouncing around in my
  head." At the time, his slogan was "To the right of Rush, and to
  the left of God." On January 1, 1995 he was given his own show
  during the drive-time hours. The show quickly became a local hit.
  In 1999, he came to the attention of the Talk Radio Network. On
  January 17, 2000 he started doing an additional two hours of
  radio which was broadcast nationally. For the next eight months,
  Savage would spend a total of five hours a day just talking. His
  national experiment was a success, and on September 21, 2000, he
  stopped doing separate shows, beginning a full three-hour
  national show. After just one year, he was in 150 markets. By
  2003, he was in over 200 markets and is currently the No. 3 radio
  host in the United States. In June 2003, he had a salary dispute
  with his flagship station KSFO who refused to renegotiate his
  contract. He was off the air for three weeks. On July 1, 2003 he
  began his show on a different station: KNEW in San Francisco.
  Since that dispute, he speaks badly of KSFO and of "Vanity or
  Pretty Boy" Sean Hannity, whose show replaced his on the station.
  Savage also speaks pejoratively when referencing his fellow talk
  radio hosts or individuals with whom he disagrees (see List of
  Michael Savage neologisms). As of 2005, Savage has between 8
  million and 10 million listeners per week. This makes his show
  the third most widely listened to broadcast in the United States.
  In 1996 he applied to be a dean at UC Berkeley's Graduate School
  of Journalism. When he was not granted an interview due to lack
  of qualifications--less than two years of experience in radio,
  with a Ph.D. in epidemiology and nutrition science--Savage filed
  a discrimination lawsuit that was eventually dismissed. The
  position instead went to China scholar Orville Schell who,
  according to Weiner, was less qualified than himself. Savage was
  hired by MSNBC to do a one-hour show starting March 8, 2003. On
  July 7, a mere four months later, he was fired for making
  anti-gay remarks in response to a caller, later identified as
  prank caller "East Coast Bob." Savage was doing an "Airline
  Horror Stories" piece, when Bob called into his show to talk
  about undercover security guards smoking in the bathroom. His
  next words were "Half hour into the flight, I need to suggest
  that Don and Mike should take your show so you can go to the
  dentist because your teeth are really bad". The words after
  "should" were bleeped out by a MSNBC exec, which would make one
  believe that the caller was actually making lewd comments about
  Savage's sexual orientation. Savage asked if he was a "sodomite",
  to which the caller answered "yes" . Savage then said to the
  caller: "Oh, so you're one of those sodomites. You should only
  get AIDS and die, you pig, how's that? Why don't you see if you
  can sue me, you pig. You got nothing better to do than to put me
  down, you piece of garbage, you got nothing better to do today,
  go eat a sausage and choke on it. Get trichinosis. Now do we have
  another nice caller here who's busy because he didn't have a nice
  night in the bathhouse who's angry at me today? Put another, put
  another sodomite on....no more calls? I don't care about these
  bums, they mean nothing to me. They're all sausages." [6] Before
  the show was canceled, MSNBC was replaying his show during
  primetime hours Saturday night; many believe the show would have
  been canceled even without his comments, and that MSNBC was
  simply looking for an excuse to dump the program due to pressure
  from special interest groups. Others point out that MSNBC has had
  poor programming and ratings performance for a long time and that
  many talk shows of all different political stripes have come and
  gone quickly on the network.</Text>

  <Text category="book">This is the worst book of Shakespeare
  criticism I have ever read. Bloom makes no attempt to link one
  paragraph to the next. It reads like 30 years of lecture notes
  piled together haphazardly, handed to a graduate student, and
  entered into a computer over a weekend. He contradicts himself
  several times. I donated my copy to the library as soon as I was
  done reading it, so I cannot cite the pages where the
  contradictions occur; but several times I recall reading a
  passage where Bloom had just said the exact opposite a few pages
  earlier. To make matters worse, he even says the bard contradicts
  HIMself. He points to supposed paradoxes regarding Hamlet's age,
  stating that his seeming age does not jive with textual evidence
  that would put his age at about 30. Apparently the point is that
  if Shakespeare contradicts himself, so can Bloom. Bloom ignores
  the obvious conclusion that Hamlet is a slacker. He has not grown
  up yet. That is why his parents tell him to come home from school
  and not to waste his time as a professional student when he
  should be learning how to run a kingdom. Some of the book's
  observations are interesting, but they are glossed over and
  presented as a random jumble from Bloom's notes. Interespersed
  between the passages scribbled down from Bloom's lectures are
  outbursts where Bloom reminds us that Shakespeare is without any
  question whatsover the greatest writer, in verse or prose, who
  ever lived. Bloom is a great critic when he still tries, but in
  this book he was not even trying</Text>

  the healthier your babies will be. Well the first 13 weeks I
  managed to gain NOTHING, and I felt horrible about it, but food
  made me so sick the last thing I could do was eat MORE food to

  altered like a woman's! No scenery or homes of interest, except a
  glance at the sailing ships in the harbor. Not a pleasant pace,
  without humor, without intrigue. A lesbian undertone in one
  scene. The only positive thing I can think of is this good line
  of Jane Austen, quoted. Fanny sums up in one sentence, why she
  will not marry him. Women who have spent hours within romance in
  uncertainty, will wish to sum up their certainty with Ms.
  Austen's line: "His sole interest is in being loved, not in
  loving". This line is an exception to a lifeless script. There,
  now you do not need to endure the painful movie. Here are two
  lines re-written by me: For the woman dealing with a trifling
  man: "No man suffers pains of love on the stage." For dealing
  with the infatuated man: "You have wounded yourself, but not with
  love." This movie should be re-made by someone sharing the ideals
  of Jane Austen. There is plenty to be mined from the novel to
  create a pleasant film, humorous, with singing, with interest. A
  movie can take the best of the book, in the spirit of the book,
  which this movie did not carry, and make a movie better than the
  book. This movie is bad any which way. Well-made period romance
  films are: "Pride &amp;amp; Prejudice 2005, 1996, &amp;amp;
  1940", "Wives &amp;amp; Daughters", "North &amp;amp; South".
  Fairly made is "Under the Greenwood Tree". I rated "Persuasion"
  at 2-stars for the wooden acting; however "Persuasion" is 5-stars
  compared to this "Mansfield Park". "Persuasion" has attractive
  scenery, costumes, beautiful singing, and an uplifting plot;
  though of interest only to women, preferably who have already
  read the book.</Text>

  <Text category="music">Most other reviewers listed here believe that
  this CD is good - I wonder if the fantastic and marvelous nature

  been my entire life - and this particular CD sounded to me like
  one long track of exactly the same music, just with different
  chords. In fact, if I was not paying specific attention, I
  couldn't tell when one song ended and another started! I enjoyed
  what I heard, but I was certainly expecting more from this CD -
  many of these Disney songs could have easily lent themselves to
  more spectacular stylings - at the very least, some variety seems
  to have been called for. Disney has always included great music
  with their movies, running the gamut of musical styles such as
  classical, jazz, blues, and even hip-hop - so maybe my problem

  <Text category="dvd">There are just some trilogy's that should not

  the same story, with the same twists. If you have seen the first,
  you have basically seen each of the sequels... except the sequels
  are both much worse. Take out the big name actors and make a
  direct-to-DVD release... and you have Wild Things: Diamonds In
  The Rough. I am sure you all know the story by now, but here is a
  brief synopsis... "Things get steamy in Blue Bay, Florida, when
  Marie, a 17-year-old beauty, gets caught in a tangle of deceit
  and double-crossing after meeting the promiscuous Elena, the new
  girl at school. Will they get away with the perfect crime or is
  someone else behind this scheme? If you have seen one of the Wild
  Things films, you have seen them all. This film lacks the quality
  of the original - mainly because we already know the twists and
  turns to come. This disc does look great, and sounds pretty good,
  but the film takes away from the overall DVD presentation. If you
  want your Wild Things fix, the original version is the one to
  watch</Text>

  <Text category="book">I am Vietnamese and I grew up in New Orleans
  during the 80's and 90's when the first waves were settling down
  there. I hate to tell this to everyone on this site but this book
  is the worst piece of fiction ever written. Like many books
  written by someone who does not belong to the culture that he
  writes about, the book takes great liberties with the imagination
  and presents the stories from the viewpoint of the writer and not
  the actual people. The Vietnamese characters in the book are
  portrayed as backwards, uneducated, and simple. Further, the
  stories are depressing and very few of the characters seem to
  have any success. If you actually grew up in New Orleans during
  the time that the Vietnamese Americans were setting root during
  the 80's and 90's, you would know that by and large, the
  community pulled itself from nothing to become quite successful.
  No real Vietnamese American thinks or acts like the characters
  portrayed in this book. I repeat - no Vietnamese American thinks
  or acts like the characters portrayed in this book. The book
  repeats many of the fallacies that I have noticed in other books
  written by predominantly caucasian male authors about East Asian
  Culture. There always seems to be 1) an asian prostitute 2)
  caucasian guy with asian bride 3) asian male in an emasculated
  role 4) asian people as backwards and simple. Quite sad. This
  book reminds me quite a bit of Memoirs of a Geisha, though that
  portrayed Japanese culture in a better light. By the way, the
  lady on which "Memoirs of a Geisha" is based and written about
  was quite upset at the author of Memoirs of a Geisha and did not
  feel that it portrayed her life or her thoughts in any way at
  all. Regardless, if you really want to find out about the
  Vietnamese American experience you should really read a book
  written by a Vietnamese American</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">Alyssa Milano's mother (who is also her
  manager) has made a crusade of tracking down nudie pics of her
  daughter on the internet. She's denounced such websites'
  "exploitation" on national TV, and has even developed a side
  business as a cybercop, lending her web-busting skills to other
  stars. Milano's mother/manager could have saved herself the
  trouble had she instead steered her daughter away from doing this
  film. Embrace of the Vampire is softcore horror porn, and the
  source for many of those Milano skin pics. After TV's Who's the
  Boss was canceled (but before Charmed returned Milano to star
  status) Milano was just another unemployed former child actress,
  so maybe this porn film seemed like a good career move at the
  time. Milano has stated in interviews that she wanted to
  demonstrate that she was not the goody-two-shoes girl she'd
  played in Who's the Boss. In other words, she wanted to "grow" as
  an actress. So she did Embrace of the Vampire, in which she goes
  topless in several scenes, engages in a lesbian romp with
  Charlotte Lewis, and participates in orgies with characters
  tonguing various parts of her nude body. Mission accomplished.
  Actually, Embrace of the Vampire uses Milano's virginal image
  from Who's the Boss by casting her as ... a virgin. A virgin
  whose boobs are straining against her too-tight blouse and who
  undresses before her boyfriend (albeit asking him not to look),
  but still, a virgin. A virgin who dreams of orgies and fondles
  lesbians and doesn't know why. Here's why: Milano is the
  reincarnation of Martin Kemp's true love. Some 300 years ago, a
  pack of scantily clad vampresses turned Kemp into a vampire
  during a blood orgy. Now that he's rediscovered Milano, he has
  three nights to rekindle her love for him. If so, they will live
  forever as vampires. If not, he dies and loses her forever. Why
  the sudden three-night deadline? Why not. The plot and
  motivations are paper thin, as is typical of porn. Milano wanders
  around campus, wondering why she's having so many sexual dreams,
  even daydreams. Her boyfriend wanders about, wondering if she's
  so pure. Kemp wanders about, seen by Milano but often not by
  others. Lewis wanders about for some bisexual action. Other
  collegiates wander about their parties and campus back alleys for
  some hetero action. Amid all this wandering there's much carnal
  action, and more carnal dreaming. Occasionally, Kemp kills
  someone for dissing Milano. John Stanley (in his Creature
  Features movie guide) correctly refers to it as a "meandering,
  almost formless script." Kemp has the best lines. Like many
  vampires, he agonizes and suffers a hyper-romantic vampire angst
  over a lost love. His appearance is a touch effeminate (too much
  eyeliner), but it lends an appropriate sinister element to his
  character. He is part romantic vampire, part bloodthirsty beast.
  Lewis's small part is pointless to the "story." All that's
  required is that she undress, and when she does, it was worth the
  wait. Rachel True (The Craft) has an even smaller role, the fate
  of all the characters who keep their clothes on. All of the above
  three are more interesting, more charismatic, than Milano or her
  boyfriend. At film's end, Kemp's tearful bloodthirsty angst, and
  Milano's tearful rediscovery of her love, the "tragic"
  star-crossed ending, and the Christian iconography, all mirror
  Coppola's Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992). One senses that director
  Goursaud was trying to rise above her porn material. However,
  this is no poor woman's Bram Stoker's Dracula. Milano is no
  Winona Ryder and Kemp is no Gary Oldman. For that matter, none of
  the other talent on this film compare to their counterparts. And
  the budget just isn't there. The strength of low-budget horror is
  a gritty authenticity, which this film tries to hide rather than
  utilize. How low was the budget? Listen, I was an extra on both
  Bram Stoker's Dracula and Embrace of the Vampire. (In both
  instances, I kept my clothes on.) I worked one day on Embrace of
  the Vampire. Don't look for me, I ended up on the cutting room
  floor, and extras are rarely mentioned in credits. But let me
  tell you an "inside story" on the making of this film: We were
  shooting in a nightclub on the Sunset Strip. The extras were
  divided into three camps: union, nonunion, and Modesto extras.
  Union extras earn the most, especially once overtime kicks in, so
  they were wrapped after eight hours (they were only hired in the
  first place to fill a union quota). This was during my nonunion
  days (I'm in SAG now), so I put in a full 14 hours, after which
  we were paid in cash and wrapped. The Modesto extras were still
  working when we left. Now what, you may ask, is a Modesto extra?
  I also wondered, and so I asked one. I was told they were from an
  acting class in Modesto, California. They had been bussed in to
  work on the film as part of a "class assignment." In other words,
  they were PAYING to come to work. There's not a whole lot to
  learn about being an extra. It's neither glamourous nor
  difficult. And nonunion extra jobs for twentysomethings are VERY
  EASY to come by. The lampposts in Los Angeles are covered with
  flyers seeking cattle, ehr, extras. I did it for the cash, and
  because if you do it often enough, you increase your chances of
  getting into the union (which I did, after some 13 grueling
  months). NEVER PAY for the "chance" to be an extra, not in Los
  Angeles. I made the mistake of volunteering to be an extra a few
  times, but wised up after a few months. My guess is the producers
  of Embrace of the Vampire paid this acting teacher to bus down
  some cattle, and far less than even nonunion extras cost. I know
  this teacher was getting paid by the students, and that they were
  not getting paid to be on the film. Another inside story: Someone
  stole a silver pin belonging to a crew member. She was near tears
  because it had sentimental value. Never leave anything of value
  lying around on a set. And some trivia: John Stanley says this
  film was "originally conceived as The Nosferatu Diaries," but on
  the set, we were told the working title was The Collector.
  Embrace of the Vampire is a decent time-killer ... barely. If
  you're looking for horror, there are hundreds of better films.
  Dozens of better vampire films. Even many superior erotic vampire
  films -- Vampyres (British, 1975) comes to mind. But if you're
  looking for Milano nudies, this is the film to see.</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">Gene Hackman is Jedidiah Tucker Ward, an aging
  yet tireless litigant for the public good, enemy of evil
  corporate type and the bane of overpaid attorneys everywhere. On
  the other side of this gap of good and evil is Maggie Ward, Jed's
  headstrong daughter. Between them is a products liability lawsuit
  involving car lights that kill people. The premise suggests the
  ending - Jed will win the day, but not before his daughter has
  been transformed into a noble attorney. Jed will fight the good
  fight (which will require supreme grandstanding) while Maggie
  learns just how amoral her side really is. What robs this
  courtroom thriller is what's missing in virtually every courtroom
  thriller - a case that could go either way, an actual case in
  controversy. Maybe because of the amount of preemptive litigation
  required just to produce a major motion picture, Hollywood is
  simply too beholden to lawyers to make a truly biting film about
  them. Instead of a compelling case, we have one that's ready for
  our verdict as soon as we've seen the suits worn by either side
  or their offices. The case in "Class Action" is one you can
  typify as "David &amp;amp; Goliath", which is to say that the end
  has been fated to be won by the little guy by a higher power.
  There's no way that we're going to see a case won (even by
  dishonest means) by Donald Moffat's hired band of Harvard-trained
  professional liars, and there's no way anybody in the audience is
  going to buy their arguments. Maggie's bosses are so
  transparently bad, that not only do they screw up, but even their
  explanations are patently evil Even so, the film stacks the deck
  against them by cynically attributing to them as evil what are
  basic facts of life for lawsuits of this kind - namely that
  products liability plaintiffs will make overbroad requests for
  discovery, and defendants respond in kind by deluging the other
  side with documents responsive to the request but otherwise
  valueless. For a thriller about high-paid lawyers, "Class Action"
  has all the legal acumen of high-school mock-trial, with fewer

  <Text category="dvd">Let me just preface my review with the fact
  that some of my favorite movies are incredibly slow and even
  "boring" to my friends. So it isn't the glacial pace of this
  movie that so bothered me. It isn't the unresolved ending that
  bothered me. It wasn't the violence (in short bursts.) It wasn't
  the acting (the acting was pretty good actually). But as a whole
  this movie was simply a tremendous failure. I didn't care who was
  sending the tapes and I didn't care what would happen with the
  main characters. They were unrelatable on just about any level.
  This movie is the kind where you will see a remotely interesting
  twist in the plot about 3/4's of the way in and you'll think,
  "wow I wonder where the story will go next". And then it doesn't.
  That was it. Very disappointing. I don't mind excruciatingly slow
  films as long as there's SOME kinda payoff in the end. I really
  don't understand all the acclaim that this movie got. As a
  "suspense" movie or as an "art" film it fails pretty miserably.
  The premise was a good idea that went nowhere...slowly. Viewer
  beware.</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">The basic pilates mat exercises are performed,
  which are okay; however, the cardio segment of this video is
  truly lame! The instructor runs the viewer through marching,
  marching and stretching one's arm at the same time and, finally,
  marching and kicking back one's leg. That's it. How incredibly
  dull! What's worse, the instructor has a terribly artificial
  clenched-tooth smile plastered to her face for the duration.
  "Pilates for Dummies" is a far better instructional video for
  newcomers to the world of pilates (do a series of jumping jacks
  or go for a run afterwards to get in your cardio). I wouldn't
  waste your time w/ this video.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Although this new release from Barbie looks
  very much like the real life singer, the doll itself is not
  something I would recommend for a child under 12. The doll is
  dressed pretty sccantilly and is adorned with realistic jewlerly.
  It also comes with a bracelet appropriate for a teen. The short
  hair of this doll and tight clothing does not lend itself to
  childs play and is more suited to a serious doll collector or
  McBride fan</Text>
  <Text category="music">My copy of "Reckless Nights..." (and yours,
  too, probably) has a sticker on front that reads: "One of the
  Most Influential Musicians of the 20th Century." Well, I'm so
  glad that Columbia cleared that up. Otherwise, I'd have had to
  make up my OWN mind, and apparently music labels don't allow that
  nowadays. I hope similar stickers are included on Chopin, Mozart,
  and Bach CDs (with the century adjusted on a per-composer basis).
  Scott's gimmicky fare makes for pleasant listening, but not in
  such a large dose--monotony sets in after two or three titles,
  let alone 22. Halfway through this CD, I felt as if I were
  listening to the drone of a defrosting icebox. For all the
  outrageous hyperbole thrown at Scott--no one else like him, no
  way to categorize his music, and so on, and so on--the reality is
  that composers and arrangers like Ferde Grofe, Duke Ellington,
  Glenn Miller, Alec Templeton, and Bill Challis covered the same
  ground far more skillfully--and, in most instances, earlier--than
  Scott. Concert jazz, symphonic jazz, or whatever you wish to call
  it, was NOT the invention of any one man, and certainly not
  Scott. Check out Grofe's scores for Whiteman--in particular, his
  writing for woodwinds and his constant, Scott-esque use of muted
  trumpet. Listen to Duke Ellington's "extended" compositions circa
  1929. For that matter, listen to Ellington's 1933 "Daybreak
  Express"--virtually the template for Scott's galloping
  miniatures. Experience Bill Challis and Glenn Miller's pioneering
  big band charts. Or... believe as you're told to believe, i.e.
  that Scott, and Scott alone, performed this kind of music. I
  mean, who needs history when we've got hype? It's up to YOU, dear
  listener</Text>
  <Text category="music">I am a hater, to the core. I hate Puffy and
  thats all it is to it. Now there, you don't have to say it.So on
  to the review. First off every lyrical line Puffy spit in this
  album was outdone by everybody. Every track he had the weakest
  flow and the worst rhymes. And thats the truth. I don't know how
  true this is, but I heard Loon was behind most of Puffy's lines
  on this album. So that should explain the utter wackness in his
  lyrics. The truth is I don't care who writes his lines. It could
  be Tupac and Nas doin it, since its not them spittin it, then it
  actually takes away from the rhymes itself. Almost this entire
  album is filler. The best tracks is Real N**** and journey
  through my life. I really didn't feel that beat a whole lot but
  Nas and Beanie's verses was off the hook. However that is not
  enough for me to give this album more than one star. Now I love
  MC Lyte and Public Enemy, but they should get smacked in the back
  of they heads with crowbars for lettin him mutilate their
  classics. Thats not musical artistry, thats butcher work. Fake
  Thug dedication really gets under my skin. The title alone. No
  disrespect to Biggie as an artist cause I do like him still. But
  they put a diss on Tupac on Life after Death after he died, then
  denied it for years. So perhaps the fake thug dedication should
  be to him, cause thats some sucker s***. I didn't hear his latest
  album, I'm not going to review it, I didn't even visit that
  section. If you a fan of this guy, then you gon cop this and his
  new one regardless. If you like me and hate just about everything
  he puts out, you won't be caught within a mile of that

  <Text category="dvd">Musicals are historically slight in the plot
  department, and this movie is no exception. Three stars: one
  fading, one rising and one coasting do not help matters either.
  Rita is the fading star. It was painful for me to watch the once
  dazzling love goddess reduced to playing the controlling widow.
  The make up department probably had to work overtime trying to
  cover the circles under her eyes, and her hair and costumes are
  just bad. Novak is the rising star, although I don't get the 50's
  obsession with bubble headed, busty, bleach blond bimbos. It
  would help if she could act, but sadly her range is very limited.
  I truly believe they added the dog to help make her character
  sympathetic, since she was unable to convey it herself. Then
  there is Frank just coasting on his charm and cool. Doesn't seem
  plausible that a hep cat like him, who could bag any "doll",
  "dame" or "mouse?", would fall for either of these gals. Anyway,
  I gave it 2 stars because of Snuffy the dog. He stole every scene
  he was in. Although that wasn't too difficult to do in such a dog
  of a movie</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This is a very mediocre Knights Kingdom set.
  There's not much of interest going on here, and the small castle
  suffers from lazy design. The colorful Knights Of Morcia are
  back, once again fighting against Vladek, the black knight. Two
  of the good knights make an appearance here (blue and purple),
  and we also get Vladek, a dark soldier, and a skeleton. The
  minifigs are as charismatic as ever, each sporting his own unique
  expression. Vladek and his henchman have that cute "I'm evil"
  Lego frown. Our knights are outfitted with the usual accessories.
  Swords and shields, and a black hatchet for the henchman. The
  scene is a small mountainside castle that is home to a large
  scorpion monster. The creature is constructed from a mixture of
  regular and Technic parts, and he has hinged pieces for an
  articulated tail and pincers. The blue knight is accompanied by
  his horse, who has a cute mini-catapult strapped to his side. The
  scorpion can fit into his den at the base of the castle, which
  has a front gate that can be raised and lowered. High atop the
  tower is a mini-catapult and a thin boom crane with a small
  barred jail cell dangling precariously from it. The rest of the
  castle is just walls, floors, and a staircase. This castle is
  very fragile. Mine fell apart several times while I was working
  on building it. On the whole, the design just isn't all that
  great. Handle with care, and play with care. Colors are mostly
  black, dark gray, dark red, and brown. This set has one of those
  nice walls with the barred window, and some signature Knights
  Kingdom battlement pieces. This set works as an addition to
  Vladek's Dark Fortress. On its own, it's stunningly less
  impressive. The good news is that a savvy Lego Maniac can take
  the castle parts and build a better castle with them. My verdict:
  one thumb up for the scorpion monster (who can be added to your
  other Knights Kingdom adventures), one thumb down for the rest.
  Could've been better. My advice is to get Vladek's Dark Fortress.
  It's more than worth the price of admission. For those still
  hungering for more Knights Kingdom action after Vladek's fortress
  has been built and conquered, this set is better than
  nothing</Text>
  <Text category="health">I had another Norelco shaver for the last 5
  (or more) years. The difference in the shaves is striking. Both
  less pain when my stubble is a little long and closer. However,
  the reason this shaver is cheaper is that there is 1 battery
  inside it instead of 2. I know this because I took it in to be
  "repaired" because I only got 8 shaves to a charge. I talked
  (online) with Norelco and they said my shaver was broken. So, I
  looked up on the Norelco site a local authorized repair shop. I
  took it in and the guy opened it up. He said it was one of the
  "cheap" versions that has 1 instead of 2 batteries. My old
  shaver, over most of its life, gave me 25 or so shaves before
  needing to be recharged. That's quite a difference</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE is a sluggish remake
  and updating of the 1962 classic starring Frank Sinatra. This
  film is a case study in why some movies should never be redone.
  This is a film that takes globalized issues and reduces them to
  personal jealousies. Afraid to assert a viewpoint, the script
  meanders. Denzel Washington plays the Sinatra role of Ben Markoe.
  He seems dazed on camera as though he is struggling to remember
  his lines. Washington, normally a gifted actor, plays the part
  without any conviction whatsoever and uncharacteristically brings
  zero charisma to the role. Markoe discovers that his Gulf War
  comrade-in-arms, Raymond Shaw, soon to be the next Vice-President
  of the United States, has been the subject of mind control
  experimentation by Manchurian Global, a vast multinational
  conglomerate. Raymond's handler is his Senator mother (Meryl
  Streep in the role of an ice queen). By diluting the threat from
  Communism to Capitalism, the producers lose sight of the most
  powerful elements of the story. After all, it is no great
  achievement to convince a major American political candidate to
  back big business, and so the grotesqueries of Shaw's
  brainwashing get lost against the backdrop, seeming less heinous
  than merely greedy, even when Shaw becomes a programmed murderer
  at the hands of his avaricious, amoral, and possibly incestuous
  mother. Why the film created the unlikely Manchurian Global
  corporation as the demon of the day and shied away from any real
  political controversy is indicative of the Manchurian Global
  mindset that has gripped Hollywood. God forbid we should point a
  finger at mainland China (or anyplace else); it might reduce the
  bottom line. This film says more about its creators than about
  the threat it attempts to portray. Do yourself a huge favor and
  stick with the original.</Text>

  <Text category="book">I am a Jew living in a college town in
  Mississippi for the past 5 years. I was born &amp;amp; raised in
  the North. I think Evans should rename his book "Fiddler on the
  Roof in the South". His book is a very nostalgic look back at
  Jewish history - as it was in the past here. It's very much: the
  southern Jews were all so happy, they all fit in and were
  accepted, etc. He does cite a few instances where they had
  problems - but these usually involved us 'Yankee Jews', like the
  instances when a few (Yankee)Rabbis in the South fought for civil
  rights. Evans should realize that times have REALLY CHANGED HERE!
  The evangelical Christians in my town (which is most people here)
  harrass me like crazy - 'I am praying for you!' 'Have you read
  the words of Jesus, who was a Jew like you?' 'When will you come
  to my Church'. Blah, blah, blah. Thank God for the minority of
  Catholics, Methodists, Presbyterians and a few others who live
  here. They are the only ones to accept me for the way I am, and
  the way I will stay - a Jew. I want all who are reading this to
  realize that I am only speaking for my experience. Jews who
  reside in cities in the South have told me that they have had far
  better experiences, and that they cannot relate to what I am
  saying. But I do want to ask Evans a few questions: 1) If things
  are so great for the Jews in the South: Why have you lived in New
  York for decades now??? 2) Why don't you at least write either a
  new Forward to the book, a magazine article, etc., contrasting
  some of the ways in which the lives of Jews in the South have
  changed over time (for some of us at least), primarily due to the
  rise of the evangelical Christians? I read Evans' books before I
  moved here, and nothing much he describes in his books is my life
  here. For a Jew who really cares about her/his religion living
  here is depressing; it is practically Jew-less; and, at best, the
  majority of a certain denomination of Christians here ignore me.
  (By the way, I am planning to move to a city!) By the way, don't
  bother writing to me to tell me that I am "wrong", or to invite
  me to things like the Bible Study at your Church. Believe me,
  with all the praying for me that is going on in this town, and
  all the myriad attempts to convert me, if it hasn't happened by
  now, as they say in these parts, it just ain't gonna

  <Text category="book">I am an elementary school teacher previewing
  this book in order to find a developmentally appropriate text for
  a study of religion. I am not religious and I strive to take a
  learner's stance and a scholarly approach to any unit of study
  that I present to my students. Betsy and Guilio Maestro have
  written other fabulous books on several topics; books that I have
  made available to my students for their research because they
  were accurate and presented without bias. This particular work
  unfortunately is neither. Their gesture was genuine and gracious,
  an example of the tolerance they wanted to promote. No deity need
  take offense; all were included in the pantheon of possibilities.
  It is however filled with inaccuracies and contradictions and
  finally a statement of belief by the authors. Though written as
  an overview of many of the world religions, this book culminates
  in a doctrinal statement of the confusing theology of religious
  pluralism, the view that no religion is objectively truer than
  any other. One point ought to be obvious, though: Everything
  can't be true. The religions mentioned are like oil and water;
  they can't mix because they represent opposite and competing
  concepts. An appeal to their similarities doesn't help. We would
  never say aspirin and arsenic are basically the same just because
  they both come in tablet form. It's the differences that are
  critical. That's true in all areas of life, especially the
  spiritual. If God exists, He's either personal or not personal.
  He can't be both. If God is merely a cosmic energy, why ask His
  blessing? He can't hear or respond. If He's a person, then He's
  someone, not everyone. This book is not as much a story of
  religions as it is a recipe for religious stew</Text>
  <Text category="health">This thing came off as 10 episodes of a weekly
  night time soap that was squished down into 3 hours. Characters
  weren't given clear introductions or motivations, they react in
  ways that don't make much sense and the accents come, go, and
  change into new accents altogether. While the format reminds me
  of a primetime soap, the acting unfortunately smacks of daytime:
  which is odd considering the long careers of many of the people

  <Text category="health">These hair topia pills are nothing but
  garbage! Pure nonsense! Trust me, I know this because I used to
  buy them. I first bought these pills last year in June 2005 after
  hair formula 37's unsuccessful promise of producing longer and
  stronger hair in the four months of usage. Well, these pills were
  not as expensive as the previous brand mentioned, and had
  promised also change dry and brittle hair into long and healthy,
  and it did absolute NOTHING. I said to myself, like hair formula
  37, that maybe I just need to give this more time, so I bought a
  2-month supply and gave it 3 months in all and there was no
  difference at all. This product might just work for others, which
  it has, but it certainly didn't work for me. I must admit that I
  brought this on myself, as my mother warned me not to buy these
  ridiculously expensive pill since they do nothing for hair that
  grows naturally anyway, and that if you really want to get hair
  pills then just buy them a whole lot cheaper in regular stores
  like Giant or even hair vitamins in the damn Dollar Store! Thus,
  I am here to warn others not to waste their precious money. And
  if you are going to, please don't do it on this site-you can buy
  this product a little cheaper at hairboutique.com.</Text>

  <Text category="music">I don't understand the previous reviews - I
  found this recording positively dreadful, with Ruthie Henshall
  being the only one worth listening to. John Sinclair is
  abominable as George - he sounds like he's doing a (bad)
  imitation of Michael Crawford in &amp;amp;quot;Hello,
  Dolly.&amp;amp;quot; He does strange things to his words - I
  guess he's trying not to sound British, but why is he singing
  &amp;amp;quot;Summ-ar weath-ar&amp;amp;quot; instead of
  &amp;amp;quot;summer weather&amp;amp;quot;? The Ilona is a bass -
  almost literally. &amp;amp;quot;I Resolve&amp;amp;quot; has been
  lowered for her, and yet she still cannot master the range of the
  song. To accomodate her, the second part of &amp;amp;quot;I Don't
  Know His Name&amp;amp;quot; has a truly odd key change. Were she
  remotely talented I could understand key changes to facilitate
  her singing, but she's not worth it. The orchestrations are odd,
  too, with strange sleigh bell sounds appearing frequently. The
  rest of the singers range from fair (Kodaly - a pretty voice but
  not much expression) to bad (Mr. Maraczek drags down EVERY SINGLE
  NOTE of &amp;amp;quot;Days Gone By.&amp;amp;quot; Luckily this is
  his only song.) The Broadway revival, to my ear, still has the
  best voices, except, of course, that Barbara Cook (the original)
  outshines Diane Fratantoni, who is merely good (but who was a
  vast improvement over the Roundabout's original Amalia, the
  annoying Judy Kuhn.) Get the original or revival recordings
  instead - this London version I would recommend only to die-hard
  SHE LOVES ME fans, or masochists. I'd rather sit through another
  terrible viewing of &amp;amp;quot;You've Got Mail&amp;amp;quot;

  <Text category="health">I really wanted to like this product after
  reading all their hype about how quick and easy it is. Not. The
  motor in it heats up quickly and the thing stops working. You
  wait about 20 minutes for it to cool down and it will start up
  again. But by the time you are getting results in one area of
  your foot, the thing heats up and stops working again. I went
  through four intervals of effective operation, heat build-up
  causing it to quit, waiting a long time for it cool off before
  starting up again. Finally I decided it isn't worth the time and
  aggravation, even though it produced good results during the
  intermittent periods when it worked. One more thing -- when I
  gave up and decided to return it, I took my Duracell batteries
  out and they were blazingly hot. I worry that it might be
  possible for the batteries to explode from the hot-running motor.
  I've never seen batteries get scalding hot like this. UPDATE:
  Found Something Much Better After returninng the Artemis, I tried
  the Medicool PediSenso professional pedicure appliance. This one
  costs 5 times the price of the Artemis but is SOOOO much better
  it is well worth it. The Medicool is plug-in electric and has
  much more power than the battery operated Artemis. It has
  variable speeds, 5 different sapphire filing attachments, and
  enough power to operate as long as you need. The sapphire files
  are different shapes and sizes and should last a lifetime,
  whereas the Artemis requires repeated purchases of its disposable
  filing heads and batteries. So over time the costs of owning the
  Artemis will add up -- if the overly hot motor does not burn out.
  If you have serious callouses and corns, like I do, the Medicool
  PediSenso will do a very serious, rewarding job. I'm so glad I
  found it and I am grateful for the relief it provides</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">City of the Dead can't really be called a
  zombie story. It's really a cheesy action novel that just happens
  to have beings called zombies in it. The zombie aren't really
  undead like in the Romero movies, but are corpses possessed by
  demons. I really didn't find any part of the novel scary and it
  doesn't seem like the author was trying to make it scary. He
  seemed to take the route so many Hollywood scary flicks take and
  just tried to gross out his readers through descriptions of the
  decayed bodies of the demons. The action is clunky and not very
  exciting. His hero's are constantly stopping to argue about
  things like how Jim's ex-wife raised their son while being hotly
  pursued by hundreds of demons. There are too many parts that
  require suspension of disbelief: a military Humvee could never
  catch an Explorer SUV, the hero's escape a fire by climbing
  across a ladder to the neighbor's house with the demons somehow
  not noticing, they're being chased by dozen's of demon vehicles
  on the road but second's later after crashing they have somehow
  lost them. And I have to ask why Keene included the descriptions
  of Necrophilia in the novel. In the end City of the Dead reads
  more like a cheesy Schwarzenegger/Stallone/Norris movie than a
  horror novel</Text>

  <Text category="book">Having read a few Bosch books already (The
  Closers and Lost Light), I realized that I should probably start
  at the beginning to get better insight on how Bosch became the
  Bosch I was reading in the later series. However, I was very
  disappointed with this book. One of the most irritating aspects
  of this book was the grammatical errors (mispellings and such). I
  found 3 or 4 in the first 50 pages (before I stopped reading)! I
  thought it was ironic that Connelly was thanking his editor at
  the beginning of the book, because it did not seem that anyone
  was editing this book. Also, I found the book to be too gritty.
  It lacked the emotion and soul that I found in the later books.
  It seemed that Connelly was trying too hard to make Bosch fit
  this certain mold, but then transformed the character to be more
  likeable in the later books that I read. So it was disappointing
  that this book could not hold my interest because I just finished
  reading The Narrows and loved it, and will probably pick up some
  other Bosch books and just read it out of order. Connelly's
  writing seems to be getting better and better, which should
  explain why I didn't enjoy this book and couldn't finish it. I
  gave it 2 stars because it might have gotten better and maybe I
  was too impatient. This is one of those series that seems like it
  is better to read out of order</Text>

  <Text category="music">There are 2 really good songs on here. The
  first is "Untitled," which sounds like Gibbard was listening to a

  sounds like it could have been on pet sounds. "Underwater" is a
  pretty good song...but the real jewel on the album is "Send
  Packing." It really is a beautiful, well-written song. The rest
  of the album sounds kind of thrown together and most of the songs
  would have been much better if they had been recorded with real
  instruments. Basically, the novelty of the kid instrument thing

  sounding a hell of a lot like too many other bands. People
  compliment them on bringing the 'old' and adding the 'new...' but
  I hear nothing new in their music. It's just ordinary,
  clichï¿½d classic rock, except for some reason no
  one told them that the classic rock era was about 40 years ago.
  If I want to listen to classic rock, I want to hear it on the

  <Text category="music">I understand why the Beatles are the top

  I would have to be said that only very few good songs came out in
  the sixties, which one of them is Neil Young's "Down By The
  River". I have listened to the Beatles for about a month and
  thought how lame and pathetic their music was. They were hugely
  one of the most overrated bands of all time. This ONE album is
  definately not the album to buy at ALL unless you are a sick
  moron who does not have a good taste in music. Here you will get
  25 of the worst songs ever recorded. If you want good music, I
  recommend go buy albums from Foreigner, Dire Straits, Green Day,
  Guns N' Roses, and Metallica insted. Don't buy this album at most
  costs as you will waste money on 25 awful songs</Text>

  First of all, it is flimsy in construction. I am under 200 lbs.,

  If only this were true. I didn't believe it. I stepped off and
  got back on and I had gained back 5 of the lost pounds. Off and

  mind. The subject matter seems to be along the lines of the bull

  analysis is used throughout the book, and if anything more than
  an encyclopedic definition is learned from this book, I would be
  astounded. Save some money and go search online for some basic

  <Text category="music">This car pictured could be a BASE or First
  Version defintely not worth 299.00 These are going for 100.00 and
  less on the web. If you havent noticed the differences in the
  packaging it wouldnt suprise me. Lots of people dont notice.
  Heres the differences below... On these 5 cars there is TWO
  versions of each driver(5 different drivers) that were made.
  First versions or BASE version and Second versions or "Added
  Features" Version. The FIRST versions have NO "added features"
  stickers and you CANNOT race ANY TWO (or more) cars of the 5
  different drivers' cars at the same time! Dale Sr. and Dale Jr.,
  Jeff Gordon, Jimmie Johnson and Tony Stewart cars of the FIRST
  versions (no added features) CANNOT race together! Transmitter
  frequencys cannot be changed. Speed and steering are straight
  function. (no varilable anything) They either turn right FULL
  turn or left FULL turn or it goes straight. Speed is either it
  goes FULL ON or it doesnt. Same for reverse gear. Again, each of
  the 5 different drivers' cars made are two different versions of
  the same car one has more features than the other. UPDATED or
  "ADDED FEATURES" versions have "ADDED FEATURES" stickers. Those
  "Added Features" are... Digital proportional steering (variable
  steering), which means you can turn the transmitter wheel
  slightly and the car turns a little. Turn the transmitter wheel
  alot and the car turns alot. Variable speed control this means
  you pull back on the trigger a little the car moves a little,
  pull back on the trigger all the way and the car takes off! This
  also works for reverse gears as well Now if this isnt cool
  enough... Each "Added Features" car has DIFFERENT Frequencies for
  different drivers' car. The transmitters for the cars are
  different as well. "ADDED FEATURES" version transmitter has two
  "trim" adjustments on the back of the remote as well as the
  Frequency Chip on the side of the remote than can be changed, and
  can also be changed on the chassis of the car. So if you own 2 of
  the Tony Stewart cars, you would have to have a Frequency pack to
  race them at the same time. Now, two or more different drivers'
  cars can race together (or Five people can race 5 different
  cars). NO TWO ALIKE CARS can race together UNLESS you have the
  "frequency of another car and transmitter" to change it, or a
  "Frequency Pack" from Team Up Inc. ALL 5 Frequency Chips DO NOT
  come with the car in the box, off the shelf. This "Frequency
  pack" is sold seperately! You can also purchase tires, suspension
  parts and body hold down clips, fully painted and ready to use
  new spare OR other drivers' teams bodies, extra rechargeable
  battery packs seperately! I have done lots of research on these
  cars and should you have any questions please

  <Text category="book">This collection of poems, tho representing a
  fine breadth of Dickenson's works, is in final assessment a crime
  against the poet's great talent. As is freely admitted in the
  introduction, the editor, Mr. Higginson, &amp;amp;quot;worked on
  the mechanics of the poems by smoothing out the rhymes and meter,
  changing the line arrangements, and rewriting the dialect of the
  local area.&amp;amp;quot; This is a free admission of the book's
  guilt, having adulterated Dickenson's original poems in both
  content and form. Gone are the nuances and passions that make
  Dickenson one of the best American writers. Gone are the
  premeditated dashed and capitalizations that add depth and
  intensity to the poems' meanings. And, worst of all, gone or
  altered are many lines that contribute to the unique vision of
  the artist. As Thomas H. Johnson says in the Introduction to
  &amp;amp;quot;The Complete Poems of Emily
  Dickenson,&amp;amp;quot; A representative mid-nineteenth century
  traditionalist was being asked to judge the work of a wholly new
  order of craftsman . . . which he was not equipped to

  <Text category="book">I have enjoyed many of Mark's novels (Do You
  Know That I Love You is my favorite of the bunch), all the time
  recognizing his severe limitations as a writer. Every character
  in every Roeder novel speaks with the same voice--all of them,
  and though his dialog is usually age appropriate for his teen
  characters, his narrative passages invariably sound as if they
  were written by someone decades older. There is frequent
  repetition and redudancy; characters never say anything once if
  they can say it two or three or four times (though he has
  definitely improved since his mediocre first novel Ancient
  Prejudice, which had the unfortunate distinction of glamorizing
  teen suicide). His characters always (and I mean always) mate for
  life, which is a beautiful romantic ideal, but ultimately can get
  tiresome (gay teens are no different from straight ones in their
  need to play the field a bit before a lifetime commitment). All
  that said, at his best (DYKWIK, A Better Life, Keeper of Secrets)
  Mark Roeder writes a compelling and often un-put-downable story.
  But in Outfield Menace, the bad most definitely outweighs the
  good. Did Mr. Roeder do ANY research into the time period??? The
  fifties are certainly a good setting for a gay teen novel (if
  only as an educational experience for contemporary teens, who
  don't realize how impossible it was to be gay at that time), but
  if you want to set a novel in the fifties, don't have a lead male
  character with a ponytail. No one, but no one, wore a pony tail
  in the fifties (and certainly not in a small midwest town). Don't
  have characters use anachronisms like "fifteen minutes of fame."
  And most of all, don't have characters behave and think in
  anachronistic wasys. Mark Roeder illustrates the dangers of self
  publishing. He has apparently made a name for himself (and some
  money I'd guess), and I must confess, I've bought his novels
  (glutton for coming out stories that I am) but no legitimate
  house would publish his novels, at least not without major
  editing and rewriting, something that a self published author
  (especially one with an apparently inflated self image) goes
  without. There has been a renaissance in quality gay teen fiction
  this past year or two. Major publishers have put out such superb
  young adult novels as Totally Joe, M or F?, The Hookup Artist,
  Rainbow Road, Boy Girl Boy. Read them, if only to see how these
  truly outstanding (and published by legit houses) novels could
  teach Mark Roeder a thing or two. If you must read Roeder, then
  stick with his better novels and avoid this serious misstep. Memo
  to Roeder: if you want to write about a time you don't know
  about, do your research</Text>

  certainly not a member of the aforementioned "Scientific School

  can accurately measure sound quality are the ones on either side
  of your head. I listen to what my ears tell me sounds good, and
  generally, tubes sound good. Which is why this book is sort of a
  disappointment, you'd think that out of 80 projects there'd be at
  least one tube phono preamp, but unfortunately there are no tube
  amps, just a few rants about how tubes don't produce enough
  power. Who uses more than a watt anyway? Even the transistor amps
  presented aren't much better than what you could get from Rex or
  Circuit City, similar schematics could probably be found on the
  internet for free. Go ahead and buy it if that's the sort of
  thing you're into, but if its tubes you want, try Morgan Jones'

  <Text category="music">I went into this a pretty big Golden Smog fan
  eager for a new effort from the guys. With Tweedy's songwriting
  having taken a great upward swing in recent years and with
  Louris' departure from the Jayhawks, I was hoping we'd see a few
  more Tweedy gems and some great tunes from the past few years
  since Louris' "Rainy Day Music" was released. Now, while there
  are some really good songs here, nothing really comes close to
  the "Red-Headed Stepchilds," "Radio Kings," or "Jennifer Save
  Mes." The album lacks something but I can't put my finger on it.
  It almost sounds like a band that has too MUCH focus. Considering
  Golden Smog started as a buncha musician friends sitting around,
  drinking beer, and goofing off, this album feels wrong. It
  doesn't have that sing-along feel (with the exception of possibly
  one or two songs) that the first couple albums (and even EP) had.
  Just a little lackluster and, considering the amount of Louris
  has his hand in on this one, almost comes off as an album of
  Jayhawks throw-aways</Text>

  <Text category="book">From a sociological perspective, Hustlers,
  Beats , and others serves what it set out to do, explore the
  sociological aspects of billiards in America and the culture that
  has accompained it through time. However with the recent boom of
  billiards into mainstram american society, many of his
  observations and conclusions are dated if not false. Te book just
  goes to many places, crime, pornography, etc. and fails what it
  set out to originally acomplish. Furthermore, I find it quite
  unusal that the author chooses to contend a great deal of current
  ideologies toward billiards . Is this not a sociological
  perspective, or an historical editorial.As a college student, and

  <Text category="dvd">( DaviD 1930's MOBSTER)...... This movie is
  based on the year 1935, The Dutchman's last year of life. It
  doesn't paint the real picture of the Dutchman or his
  orginazation. ( Dutch Schultz was a ruthless hot head who didn't
  entertain a thing. Billy Bathgate was supposed to be Dutch's
  Protege but was merly an errand boy (No gun play at all). There
  was almost no gun fights in this movie or the showing of daily
  operations which was still going on in 1935. There was a
  apperance by Lucky Luciano which was good but nothing shown of
  the Commission which Dutch was a part of. The best Dutch Schultz
  I have seen on Film is (HOODLUM). If your like me and want the

  <Text category="book">I can see how instructors would be
  enthusiastic about this book, but unfortunately it will in no way
  help the student develop their ear training. Here's the problem.
  The book and CD basically outlines a METHOD of ear training, it
  is not ear training itself. For example, for each step of the
  book there is one and only one example on the CD. It is just
  that, an example, not a training. So, there is one 14 note
  "lesson" on intervals and from this you are supposed to magically
  learn how to identify all the major intervals. I don't think so.
  However, if you were an instructor then you could use that
  example as a starting point to develop your own lessons and work
  with students in recognizing intervals. You could spend a month
  on variations of that lesson itself since that's the core of ear
  training. In fact, if you're an instructor you can use the whole
  book as a blueprint for a year long curriculum from recognizing
  intervals to recognizing chords. By the way, the CD itself mostly
  uses really dull organ patches. The idea may have been to
  eliminate timbre as a distraction. However, since one of the
  goals of ear training is to distinguish timbre from tone, this is
  another example of how this book/CD in itself won't be of much
  use to students.</Text>

  <Text category="book">I wonder if Jance wrote this just to get a
  movie credit based on her novel. One cannot help but be
  suspicious of writers who shift gears in their careers and write
  in a Tom Clancy or John D. Macdonald style just because that's
  what film-going audiences like. I do not think this is a bad
  thing, but I, like some of the reviewers here, are so fed up with
  clich&amp;#x1A; plots that just borrow from i.e., Macdonald's
  &amp;amp;quot;Cape Fear,&amp;amp;quot; or use that tired Native
  American romanticism that certainly sells the box office tickets
  through the roof. As for her writing style, she really should
  stay away from those scenes where character developments have not
  fully grown. What we're left with are people who are one
  dimensional like both the Walker parents, Davy, his fiancee, and
  to some extent, Lani, who just never convinced me that she had
  the fire of the budding Medicine Woman. Her male voice is very
  forced machismo that is typical of female writers who are
  testosterone-challenged. The men in this novel just weren't
  credible when they spoke. I kept seeing Jance speaking for them.
  So we're left with a high-concept piece that is still waiting for
  Hollywood to call and possibly star Penelope Cruz as Lani Walker.

  entirely on random dice rolls to determine every single outcome
  of the game. To move from place to place, you roll dice. To
  challenge another player to a "skirmish" (which is how you steal
  their treasure), you roll dice. To steal jewels from an enemy's
  port, you roll dice. To trade for jewels at a port, you roll
  dice. There's absolutely no semblance of any real strategy in
  this game. You win by accumulating the most treasure, and the
  amount of treasure you accumulate depends entirely on how lucky
  you are in your roll of the dice. This game is not fun, and can
  even be frustrating, especially for a young child who keeps
  rolling low numbers. There's SOME thinking involved... you need
  to judge for yourself who you should attack and when, but even if
  you make the best possible strategic decision, you can still lose
  the die roll and end up empty-handed. I would recommend Dread
  Pirate only if your family is specifically looking for a game
  where you don't have to think, and only if your children are
  mature enough to deal with bad luck (as good/bad luck is the only
  way to win/lose this game). If you're looking for an enjoyable
  family game that everyone can play, I would very much reccommend
  Cranium over this. It's less expensive, there's ALOT more to it,
  and it will have your family getting up, being active, and
  laughing out loud (instead of sitting around and rolling dice to
  determine the number of jewels you can take)</Text>
  <Text category="health">I wonder if they'll continue this to focus on
  the kid, the father, and the other people? Who really cares to be
  honest - such TRASH</Text>
  <Text category="book">This book was given to me by my cousin who
  thought I might find faith after hearing the eulogy I gave at my
  father's funeral a year ago, in which I professed that I do not
  know if there is a God or not, but that the best we can do is be
  good people. I am agnostic, in that I am fully aware that there
  is no factual evidence that God exists and that there is no
  evidence that God does not exist. To be clear - if there was, I
  am pretty sure it would be widely publicized. The gift was a
  loving gesture and I am sincerely appreciative of it. However, I
  have several issues with the book. More than I can possibly
  iterate at this point. This book does not even mention
  agnosticism. As the author was educated at Yale, I am sure he
  must be aware of agnosticism and chose to omit it from his book.
  I can only presume that it was omitted with a reason, perhaps it
  was too hard to explain in the face of his assertion that there
  is evidence for God (see below - all circumstantial and requiring
  leaps of faith). Without getting into too many specifics, the
  evidence he uses in the Case for Faith comes from obviously
  Christian sources - which are surely biased. This is equivalent
  to reporting on terrorist acts by only interviewing terrorists.
  Certainly one's reporting would be validating reasons for such
  atrocities. To be clear I am only drawing this distinction to
  make the point - a true investigative reporter would look to
  include both sides of the story and present facts as opposed to
  opinion. Had Strobel intended to provide a balanced view, he
  would have used non-christian scientists and believers of various
  faiths. Strobel's statements portend to be fact, but are
  generally lacking any actual evidence and in some cases are
  easily determined to be incorrect. A couple of examples are 1)
  His statement that Buddhism says there is no God (various sects
  of Buddhism believe in gods, state there is no Creator God or do
  not take a stand on the matter) and 2) His statements on lack of
  evidence for evolution - specifically macroevolution (which is
  fairly well supported by actual evidence and observation - and
  believed to be accurate by 99% of biologists). Regarding
  evolution, there is actually evidence for macroevolution -
  although he claims there is none. This is where I have serious
  problems with the book. In my opinion, the book is more for
  current believers who need/desire to strengthen their faith,
  which I believe is a good thing. However, his information lacks
  factual support and evidence, which to me is a bad thing. I
  believe that most of the people who would read it would not get
  to the point of questioning the information in it. If one were to
  question it, one could easily find their faith destroyed if the
  information one held to be true (and which subsequently was the
  basis for faith) is found to be false. He states that there is
  evidence for intelligent design; however the evidence he offers
  is only theory in the colloquial sense - i.e. a guess. The Theory
  of evolution is a theory in the scientific sense - i.e. supported
  by on observation and evidence. Another example is when Strobel
  quotes "...when it comes right down to it, the only person or
  thing I know of worth my faith - the only one supported by the
  evidence of history and archaeology and literature and experience
  - is Jesus." The Buddha (meaning one who is awake), or Siddhartha
  Gautama (his real name), was an actual person, supported by all
  of the above listed proof of Jesus. Mohammad was also an actual
  person supported by all of the above. His 3 reasons for disbelief
  in reincarnation (for regular people): 1) If James loses 3
  pounds, he is still James, if he becomes a grasshopper he is not
  James - because he is not human 2) Support for past lives - such
  as memories, are explainable by psychological explanations, lucky
  guesses, or demonic possession 3) The only expert on this
  question, Jesus of Nazareth, said it doesn't happen. To respond:
  1) To believe in resurrection, one must believe that there is a
  substance which makes us who we are that is not tied to our
  earthly form. It is not tied to being human, but to existing. 2)
  How do you discount the possibility that reincarnation exists by
  asserting that demon possession exists - there is factual
  evidence for neither. 3) To be in line with this reason, one must
  already accept the divinity of Jesus and that the resurrection
  actually happened. His arguments for the truth of the
  resurrection (below) are weak and offer no support for the fact,
  only that people claimed it happened. We should not confuse the
  fact that Jesus existed with the belief that he was the son of
  God and specifically that he was reincarnated. Here are his proof
  that God exists: 1) God makes sense of the Universe's origin 2)
  God makes sense of the universe's complexity 3) God makes sense
  of moral values (his argument is - if there are absolute moral
  values then God must exists God makes sense of the resurrection
  (see proof below). 4) God can be immediately experienced. To
  respond: 1) Theories can be used to explain phenomenon that
  correlate to reality, but are not truly an explanation of
  reality. One still must take a leap of faith to believe his
  assertion. While it may explain questions about the universe -
  how do we know it to be accurate? Put another way, there are
  other explanations that could wrap up the universe -
  additionally, one presumes he is speaking of the Christian God
  and discounting other belief systems. 2) See my first objection.
  Same point. 3) Science believes in hard observable facts being
  the basis for making assertions. The basis of scientific fact is
  that it is able to be recreated by anyone. To take the leap from
  the fact that there are widely accepted truths to being proof of
  God requires faith. He gives examples of ideas that most of the
  civilized world thinks are wrong, and uses them as the basis for
  absolute moral values. He omits that moral values have changed
  over time and are evolving. While I do believe that things are
  wrong, one can easily recognize that they are not always
  absolute...for example, it is not ok to kill, unless you are in
  danger - or the other person killed others (presuming you believe
  in capital punishment). 4) His example here is that you cannot
  prove the world exists...fair enough, but one can prove there are
  universally experienced events that we can demonstrate over and
  over again. For example, we can do a physics experiment and
  everyone involved will see the same results (barring
  psychological conditions). While we may not be able to prove that
  the world exists, we can confirm common experience, which is
  essentially what the world is...the ground on which we all
  interact - whether or not that is created in the mind (the
  example he gives for how the world may not exist is that all of
  the world may only be in our mind). Proof Jesus was resurrected:
  1) The location of Jesus' burial was widely known and agreed on.
  2) The Sunday after his crucifixion the tomb was empty, which is
  agreed upon by many (or all). 3) Various groups of people
  experienced appearances of Jesus alive again. 4) The original
  disciples suddenly and sincerely believe that Jesus was risen
  from the dead - even enough to die for this belief. To respond:
  1) This is fact and Jesus did exist. Not sure how it relates to
  his divinity. 2) This could be explained in several ways, hard to
  use this as proof of his divinity. One can suppose it is, but it
  takes a leap of faith - this book is supposed to explain how to
  have faith - but continually requests we make leaps of faith. 3)
  Writings of people who claims to experience Jesus can hardly be
  taken as fact. Other religious text would claim the same about
  their prophets, gods, etc. 4) The disciples had a vested interest
  in proclaiming the divinity of Jesus. This is not actual
  evidence. This is equivalent to stating that the bible is true
  because it says it is true. Additionally, Strobel chooses which
  parts of the bible are literal and which are metaphorical. In
  dealing with "Objection 5" Strobel notes that the descriptions of
  Hell in the bible are metaphorical. It is hard to discern how
  someone can pick and choose which parts of the bible are literal
  and which are metaphorical. It is convenient to do so when your
  explanations support your understanding. I am not sure how you
  justify doing this. He states that only one religion can be right
  or God is schizophrenic. One supposes his assertion is that
  Christianity is the one true religion or God is schizophrenic.
  This again is a leap of faith. One must also presume that the
  various religions are not human error in interpreting God's
  message. My stand is this, we do not know, and to have faith is
  great, however by creating a context in which one can have faith
  by providing erroneous and undeniably false/biased information, a
  false faith is created. Faith should be born out of one's desire
  and belief system. One should not need to discount others because
  of their faith. To me, doing so indicates weakness in their faith
  - not strength.</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">In terms of both format and style, "Rent" -
  despite its superficially modernist tendencies - has its roots
  firmly planted in the grand old operatic tradition. Yet, it
  suffers from the weakness common to most modern musicals in which
  the characters sing virtually nonstop throughout the entire
  production - which is that it makes it hard for the audience to
  connect with the characters. In more traditional musicals, the
  long stretches of spoken exposition between song-and-dance
  sequences serve as an opportunity for the audience to get to know
  the characters as recognizable, flesh-and-blood human beings.
  This is less of a problem with a florid romantic fantasy like
  "Phantom of the Opera," which seems a natural for this type of
  approach, but with material like "Rent," which is small in scale
  and intimate in scope, the constant singing serves as a
  distancing device for the audience. I know that this play (and,
  perhaps now, even the movie) has generated a passionately loyal
  fan base who considers "Rent" practically sacrosanct and
  therefore beyond criticism, but to someone, like myself, coming
  cold to the work, "Rent" adds up to much less than the sum of its
  parts. The story, a modern day update of "La Boheme" set in
  Greenwich Village, starts on Christmas Eve, 1989, and ends on
  Christmas Eve, 1990. This was at the height of the AIDS epidemic,
  and, indeed, many of the film's characters - primarily gay men
  and former junkies - are struggling with the disease (AIDS being
  the modern equivalent of the consumption used in the original
  story). There's also a wheezy subplot involving a real estate
  company that wants to evict the starving artists (one is tempted
  to call them "deadbeats") from a building in order to further
  their diabolical scheme of re-developing a city block. "Rent" -
  with its noble "performance artists" doing battle against the Big
  Bad Corporate Bullies - feels less like a relic from the `80's
  than one from the `60's. Though intended to be the heroes of the
  piece, the artists and bohemians often come across as
  naï¿½ve, painfully self-absorbed, and annoyingly
  self-righteous, an attitude epitomized by one of the characters
  rigging a local ATM machine so that his buddies can withdraw
  unlimited amounts of money from it using his dead boyfriend's
  name (the heavily allegorical "Angel") as the password (this is
  somehow supposed to be seen as admirable and a tribute to the
  spirit of the dead man). Anything`s better than actually working,
  I suppose, and becoming a tool of corporate America. When one of
  the men finally takes a dreaded "job" ( a mere sinecure, I might
  add) so that he can actually pay the rent he owes (horrors!), he
  acts as if he is selling his soul to Satan, and has to have two
  of his lady friends accompany him to the interview for moral
  support and to offer him assurances that he will still be able to
  live with himself even after he has soiled his hands with the
  dirty mammon from an honest-to-God paycheck. I wonder why it
  never occurs to any of these characters that the capitalist
  system they loathe so deeply is also helping to produce drugs
  that will one day lead to a possible cure for the disease that
  afflicts them. With the exception of newcomer Rosario Dawson, the
  filmmakers have retained most of the original Broadway cast
  members for the movie, and even though their acting isn't all
  that impressive, some of them do very well indeed at singing and
  dancing. In his direction, Chris Columbus has broken away from
  the confines of the original production, but he never manages to
  bring us into the world of the people we're watching. Despite the
  constantly tracking - sometimes even spinning - camera he has
  chosen to employ, the film still feels stagy, over-stylized and
  artificial in almost every scene. As to the libretto by the late
  Jonathon Larsen, only one tune strikes me as truly memorable,
  while the rest all sound like repetitive musical doodling. One of
  the problems, too, with having so much of the conversation sung
  rather than spoken is that the lines are sometimes so
  utilitarian, pedestrian and prosaic - when they aren't
  pseudo-intellectual drivel on the order of "the opposite of war
  isn't peace; it's creation" - that they become unintentionally
  funny when set to music. It's not for nothing that the Sharks and
  the Jets didn't actually sing out most of their confrontations.
  There are, admittedly, some very moving passages in the last half
  hour of the film as the disease finally begins taking its grim
  toll on several of the characters, but those moments of quality
  are completely undercut by one of the silliest copout endings I
  have ever seen in a motion picture. In that one crucial moment,
  the movie descends to the level of low comedy and farce, taking
  any pretensions to seriousness right down the drain with it. I
  don`t question for a moment the basic humanity and sincerity of
  the people responsible for "Rent" (or of its many devoted
  followers), but it`s hard to get too worked up over a story whose
  premise seems to be that people - especially "sensitive" artists
  - should be allowed to live on other people`s properties for
  free</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">I was intrigued by "Satan's Little Helper" due
  to several things namely its Halloween theme, which I'm a big
  sucker for, and the heralded return of Jeff Lieberman to the
  horror scene. Lieberman made 4 minor cult horror films in the
  70's and 80's, the last one being 1987's "Remote Control". You
  would think that Lieberman, with all this time off from
  filmmaking would have spent his share of time carefully observing
  horror films in order to craft a good one when he would choose to
  return. Well, it almost feels like Lieberman is stuck in some
  kind of time warp, as this movie looks like it came straight from
  the 80's due to how cheesy, trashy, cheap and godawful it is.
  Many, myself included, look upon the 80's slasher craze with fond
  nostalgia but this is one film that reminds us how truly bad some
  of those films could be. The "plot" revolves around a 10-year old
  boy who is a huge fan of the video game "Satan's Little Helper".
  It's now Halloween season and his mom buys him a devil costume,
  which he wears proudly. One afternoon, he spots a tall man
  wearing an equally devilish costume dragging bodies around to
  serve as Halloween decoration stiffs for the front of his house.
  He becomes enamored with the tall &amp;amp; mute masked man and
  asks him if he can be his helper. The two then go on a rampage
  throughout the small suburban community, as the masked man kills
  people randomly in gruesome fashion all the while the boy (whose
  intelligence quotient appears to be much closer to a 5-year old
  than a 10-year old) inexplicably thinks it's all still a game of
  make believe. If you think the plot sounds bad that's nothing
  compared to how poorly this movie is executed. Nearly everything
  about it is god-awful from the camcorder film quality, to the
  laughable gore effects (including the least-ever convincing
  intestines I've ever seen) and especially, the acting. The
  10-year old boy, who appears in nearly every scene, makes a run
  for most annoying child actor in recent memory. The acting on
  just about everyone's part is bad, and the characters all come
  across as being mentally retarded from the clueless boy to the
  mute villain who kills for no apparent or explained reason, the
  flaky sister and the eccentric, kooky mother. There is not a
  single character we can give a darn about and we don't care the
  least bit when someone gets killed. Granted, dumb characters who
  do dumb things in horror movies are a dime a dozen, but these
  ones truly take the cake. I'm a little baffled as to why this
  movie has gotten its share of enthusiastic reviews. I'm thinking
  some people are going to put this in the "so good it's bad"
  category but I'm not having it. Some of the scenes in the movie
  that were meant to be "funny", such as the parking lot scene
  where the villain and boy knock off a pregnant woman, an elderly
  lady, and a stroller carrying a kid, are downright appalling. The
  villain himself is a bad joke, as he doesn't utter a single word
  throughout the film, instead delivering thumbs-up signs to the
  kid and wagging his finger. Cheesy? Heck, this film is cheesier
  than a Black Diamond factory. "Satan's little helper" comes
  across as the work of a first-time wannabe horror amateur with no
  budget, not something from a guy in his fifties considered a cult
  filmmaker. To sum up how I feel about this film, I will repeat a
  line that I see all over Amazon that I usually feel redundant but
  somehow I find to be entirely fitting for this movie. DO NOT RENT
  OR BUY THIS GARBAGE!!</Text>

  <Text category="book">I bought this audio CD set at the Borders

  The audio quality is very insonsistent, at at times very poor,
  having been transcribed from the original audiotape recording.
  While the author is obviously greatly informed on the historical
  and geopolitical details of the Middle East, it does read very
  much like a history text. With the amount of detail presented,
  and the wide scope of coverage from one end of Europe reaching
  into the former Soviet states and beyond, one immediately feels
  the need for visual aids (maps, timelines, etc.) as guidance. The
  reader's narration is monotononous, with a very constant cadence
  which dulls the senses. Each sentence sounds the same as the
  last. This has the unfortunate effect of rendering each piece of
  information presented as no more significant than any other, and
  so all of the events seem to be lost to obscurity. After a while,
  the narration becomes little more than background noise. No
  information is retained by the listener</Text>
  <Text category="music">In many ways a relic of its era, "Not of This
  Earth" is the first widely distributed release by Joe Satriani (a
  previous EP ended up being reissued as part of "Time Machine",
  years later). The guitarist, supported by drummer Jeff Campitelli
  and percussionist John Cuniberti came into public attention when
  Steve Vai, a former student of Satriani, ended up singing his
  teacher's praises in the music press. The result is that this
  album, more than likely to have been lost in the shuffle of
  instrumental rock music, received wider recognition and poised
  Satriani to explode into a bonafide celebrity on his next record.
  The album itself is a bit uneven-- Satriani is a flawlessly
  brilliant guitarist, but as a songwriter, he wasn't quite ready.
  Several pieces ("Not of This Earth", "Hordes of Locusts") seem to
  run out of steam before they end, and a couple ("The Snake",
  "Driving At Night") feel like bad '80s metal. On the other hand,
  several pieces shine-- delicate and lovely "Rubina", reggaeish
  and emotionally soaked "Memories", and the overtly Frippesque
  "New Day" are all fine examples of what Satriani is capable of.
  But my favorite is probably "Brother John", where Satriani
  abandons all his effects and performs his delicate and bubbly
  melody cleantone. In the end, the album is ok, but Satriani would
  go on to do so much more interesting in the future. Come back to
  this one if you've picked up a bunch of other stuff and are
  looking for more, but most should start with "Surfing With the

  <Text category="music">Reviewgium - Volume I, issue XVII Over sixty
  and still going strong, Neil Young has released a new album,
  largely politcal and essentially a focused attack on U.S.
  President George W. Bush. As opposed to his last album which was
  a more bittersweet, country-tinged effort, Living With War is a
  pretty much straightforward rock album, mostly electric with a
  background choir featured on many tracks, as well as an unusually
  predominant trumpet player on several tracks. Musically, it's
  nothing spectacular, in fact every song more or less follows the
  same tired formula, and there are really no diversions from the
  grunge-like rhythm guitar chords. But the album is obviously
  intended to have a major focus on the vocals and lyrics. Of
  course, many people do not like Neil Young's vocals, but there
  are many well-developed choral passages throughout the album,
  including a soulful, a capella arrangement of "America the
  Beautiful," which closes the album. So basically, I feel the
  vocal performances compensate--though not totally--for the lack
  of musical diversity. Lyrically, the album is pretty blatant; it
  could almost be a 60's protest album. But underlying that, is a
  ray of hope and an urge to change our country for the better.
  There are a few decent tracks on the album, even if they are not
  exactly mind-blowing (not that Neil Young was ever a showboater).
  "After the Garden" is actually quite a good song as is "Shock and
  Awe." "Flags of Freedom" is a bit of an upper, so I can probably
  call that the album highlight, though I'm sure the more
  politically-minded citizen will enjoy "Let's Impeach the
  President," an almost humorous overview of Bush's faltering
  standpoints. The final three songs divert from the general theme
  of dismay and protest, and offer feelings of hope and
  introspection. If you are not a fan of Neil Young, you'll find
  nothing here that will convert you, so you may just want to leave
  this on the shelf. If you are "anti-Bush" you might get a buzz
  off of the lyrical aspect, but that's probably the only thrill
  you will get. I tend to avoid anything political, so music aside,
  this album's message does not really appeal to me. It's like,
  yeah, people hate the President, blah blah blah, we know...give
  it a rest. For fans of Neil, I wouldn't exactly say "you're not
  missing anything" by avoiding this album; there is some good
  stuff on there, but you might want to wait until you see it cheap
  in the "used" bin at your local CD shop. And for those
  interested, this is not a Crazy Horse album.</Text>

  <Text category="health">I've used the CardioChek 6 times, and had my
  cholesterol checked at a doctor's office during the same period.
  My cholesterol levels according to the doctor's tests are always
  around 200. With the CardioChek they vary by as much as 90
  points. It is a lot of trouble (and expensive) to purchase 3 sets
  of test strips and stab myself 3 times to test total Cholesterol,
  HDL Cholesterol, and Triglycerides. No test strips are included
  in the package when I purchased the CardioChek. The box says
  "includes check strips" but those are something other than test
  strips</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I have seen many pathetic films in my life.
  This topped them. Did I rate one star? Sorry- I meant negative 11
  stars. It was the absolute worst movie I have ever seen in my
  entire life. It was a total waste of three hours when I could
  have been sleeping. There was no point. The script and storyline
  were pathetic. The gore was overdone- too much blood, killing,
  and the like. It was totally historically inaccurate, and the
  Civil War scenes were so grossly unrealistic that it was
  laughable. All Civil War veterans are rolling over in their
  graves. Any scene that was supposed to be touching was pathetic.
  One of the abolsute bombs was when Clint Eastwood fires off a
  canon twice with his cigar- yet he does not even load it- either
  time. And somehow, without even aiming the canon, he knocks his
  'friend' off his horse. The movie is a failure. F-A-I-L-U-R-E.
  Crappy. Junky. Just plain DUMB. STUPID. PATHETIC. I am not going
  to waste any more words on it. Just....whatever you do....save
  your money. Don't buy it. It's not worth 50 cents</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">It Could Happen to You was a bit of a
  disappointment, considering the makeup of the cast: Nicolas Cage,
  Bridget Fonda, and Rosie Perez among others. The movie brings to
  the screen the story of a policeman who after winning 4 million
  dollars on the NY state lotto, decides to share half of it with a
  waitress he met the previous day. The acting is surprisingly (!)
  below average, the dialogues are way below average, while the
  plot is not bad at all. Nicolas Cage's character is too naive and
  too slow, and that was just sad/pitiful! Bridget Fonda was
  unexpectedly plain and bland. Rosie Perez's character was overly
  exaggerated to the point that it got tiring AND annoying very
  early on. As for Wendell Pierce and Stanley Tucci this film does
  not seem to be their thing; they don't seem to belong.
  Subsequently, they are not convincing in their roles at all.
  Finally, somebody shoot the "Narrator," PLEASE! Though the
  potential for a great movie was definitely there it fails to take
  off. A shame really... No masterpiece here. If Nicolas Cage is
  what you had in mind, check out the AMAZING movies City of Angels
  and/or The Family Man.</Text>

  <Text category="book">I was intrigued by his &amp;amp;quot;The End
  of History.&amp;amp;quot; I thought his
  &amp;amp;quot;Trust&amp;amp;quot; was a brilliant book and used
  it extensively in my masters thesis and doctoral dissertation. I
  only hope this latest book is a disruption in an ongoing chain of
  good books. In the end, &amp;amp;quot;The Great
  Disruption&amp;amp;quot; is a down right silly book. It has a lot
  of usefull data but Fukuyama's humanistic ideology clouds it all.
  All his empirical data and any real understanding of history
  undermine his polly-anna conclusion: that things just have to get
  better because people are ultimately good. Fukuyama proves that
  the moral consensus -- the social capital -- of the earlier era
  has been wiped away. That crime has sky-rocketed and that the
  apparent drops in recent crime rates are only the result of high
  incarceration rates and lower percentages of younger men. Then he
  turns around and wants us to believe that disfunctional behaviour
  has dropped because people are naturally gregarious and have a
  natural inclination to rebuild social capital. He doesn't bother
  to deal with societies -- like Ethiopia -- that have never been
  able to build up enough social capital. He doesn't really look
  any further back in history past about 1950. His generalizations
  about the 19th century merely show how little he has taken into
  account the big picture of history. He thinks (based on his
  ideology of human goodness) that things just have to get better.
  If he had studied Pitirim Sorokin for a really big picture of
  history, he would know better. People can come to a similar
  optimistic conclusion as does Fukuyama but they will need to be
  much better grounded in history if they are going to make
  generalizations about long-term historical cycles. For that, I
  would recommend Robert W. Fogel's &amp;amp;quot;The Fourth Great
  Awakening and the Future of Egalitarianism.&amp;amp;quot; Fogel,
  a Nobel prize winner, has all the optimism of Fukuyama but with
  the history to back it up</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">Whoever made this film is obviously trying to
  impress upon the viewer the idea that artists are deep complex
  people. But all I see in the film are low life drug addict losers
  who sit around (few of them seem to have jobs) and party all day.
  The main character (Sid) is a pseudointellectual who claims she
  majored in Critical Theory in college (ultra liberal nonsense
  which has the goal of undermining Western Culture to pave the
  pathway for Marxism). The film appeals to naive youth</Text>
  <Text category="music">I can't fathom why anyone would enjoy this
  album. The lyrics must have come out of a Dadaist poetry circle,
  and (most of) the guitar work is completely without personality.
  What is the criterion of a good rock album? By any standards it
  must be a joy to play it. 6teen Stone misses the mark by such
  dimensions one must assume it was intentional. But it doesn't so
  much incite anger than it does disdain for Bush's attempts to
  emulate Nirvana. Where Nirvana has clearly enunciated guitar
  riffs and minimalist, evocative lyrics, Bush has dull, throbbing
  guitar drones that project nothing to the listener but a kind of
  malaise-inspired anger. There's not much more to say about 6teen
  Stone. I could tell you about the embarrassment of listening to
  the lyrics on songs like "Swim": Thinning ice / 14 Hairdryers /
  Swimming to you / Flame on earth desire." Or the artistic suicide
  of the last track, "X-Girlfriend", a song composed of a little
  guitar-wailing and a non-stop chorus that's about six words long.
  That's about all I can tell you. Mostly I figure I've done enough
  warning to let you make your own choice. If you do attempt this
  though, you ought to be told the little good news that there is:
  there are about 5 minutes of good music are contained on the
  album, split between "Machinehead" and "Glycerine." The first is
  an energetic, well-constructed song about control (you might have
  seen the music video for it about 11 years ago on Total Request
  Live), the second a serenade featuring over-dubbed guitars, a
  trembling cello, and a surprisingly coherent Rossdale. They hold
  the album; about as well as a couple of floor joists can hold a
  crumbling building.</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">Every Lakers fan I've ever met lives in the
  past sadly now. To them, the clock stopped when Kareem and Magic
  hung up the shoes [and we know why Magic had to leave]. Their
  basketball knowledge from the 60s to the 90s is rewarding. After
  this, however, they don't have a clue of what has happened to
  this once mighty and moral organization. The Lakers have been a
  good team over the decades [as apparent on this DVD set], but the
  run of greatness is coming to a LONG slide with Kobe driving the
  Bus. The Lakers were once considered the Green Bay Packers of the
  NFL, but now they're just lucky to even get close to a playoff
  spot over a majority of the teams in the Western Conference which
  are much better than the present Lakers. I recently attended a
  game last Fall at the Staples Center, and besides all of the
  celebs eating hummus in the stands, I could barely hear myself
  think over Phil Jackson's mantra "I told you so." Further
  illustrating how things have changed in LA, Jack Nicholson has
  become embarrassed to wear anything purple or yellow. So it is
  understandable that Laker fans would rather focus on the
  achievements of Magic and Kareem, than rather extol the
  diminishing skills of Kobe since his Colorado folly. There are
  some good games on this DVD along with great moments from the
  Baylor, Chamberlain, West days. I recommend any Laker fan to
  purchase this DVD set to relive the past. So Laker fans, keep
  living in the past if you so desire. Maybe Kobe will retire and
  become a man of the cloth and lead the Lakers to the NBA
  Championship promised land once again. Long live the Forum [or
  the Staple Remover Center] or whatever they are calling the
  Lakers home now</Text>
  <Text category="book">Overall, I found this book disappointing. In
  its defense, its basic thesis of the movement of Jewish American
  Orthodoxy towards the `right' (more closed and intensely
  religious) is interesting, and I am sure accurate, and Heilman's
  analysis of its evolution is insightful and well-researched.
  However, I was extremely bothered by the lack of any attempt to
  portray Hareidi society through the prism of its own value
  system, or in fact any attempt to understand their values at all.
  Heilman accepts his own world view as absolute and obvious to the
  reader, and in this context denigrates a society with an entirely
  different set of goals and aspirations. Examples of this include
  his assumption of the primacy of feminism and the worth of
  secular culture. Hareidi society has its own worldview which,
  although too complex to elaborate on here, has valid and very
  real reasons for its hierarchy of values, reasons which Heilman
  completely disparages or ignores. (For an example of a book that
  is not written by a religious author, yet is able to appreciate
  Hareidim from their own perspective try "Real Jews" by Noah
  Efron). In general, I found his view of religion as a mere
  sociological construct (i.e. a defensive reaction to the
  Holocaust) to be grossly insensitive to the Hareidi intense
  religious belief founded on thousands of years of tradition. The
  latter half of the book I found a pathetic attempt to draw
  conclusions from insignificant pieces of information. For example
  the juxtaposition of poster A condemning something to a poster
  advertising B implies that poster A is condemning B as well. Or
  two posters (put out by the same company) advertising two
  different types of music indicates that the community is
  embattled over the appropriateness of one type of music. In
  conclusion, although I eagerly awaited this book and found a
  fraction of it interesting and intelligent, my overall impression
  is negative due to the authors biased approach and manipulative
  use of insignificant information.</Text>

  <Text category="book">The author tries to bring both the biography
  of Walsingham and a discussion of the birth of espionage together
  in the same book and succeeds at neither. It is a fine read if
  you would like a general overview of the time, but, after reading
  the title and reviews, I was hoping for a detailed biography of
  Walsingham or much detail on how he created the group of people
  who became his information gatherers. Instead, it is a general
  overview of Walsingham's life with references to the work that he
  did. There are some interesting facts that the author brings
  forward that the reader might not find elsewhere , but the
  majority of the reading is rehashed from biographies of Elizabeth

  <Text category="dvd">Of the dozen tracks featured here, chances are
  the typical listener will only recognize four:
  &amp;amp;quot;Signs,&amp;amp;quot; &amp;amp;quot;Sweet City
  Woman,&amp;amp;quot; &amp;amp;quot;One Fine Morning&amp;amp;quot;
  and &amp;amp;quot;Gimme Dat Ding&amp;amp;quot; - and the
  last-named is out of sequence, having come out more than a year
  before the others. The star of this show is Lighthouse's
  &amp;amp;quot;One Fine Morning,&amp;amp;quot; and Rhino must be
  praised for offering up the full (LP) version rather than the
  45-rpm edit, which was about two minutes shorter. It's a shame,
  in a way, that this song had lyrics; had it been an instrumental,
  it would have found a perfect and permanent home - on
  &amp;amp;quot;Music From NFL Films&amp;amp;quot; - it had that

  <Text category="music">Michael Jackson is one of the most gifted
  songwriters/singers of our time. You can discuss his person, you
  can discuss his behaviour, and all the other stuff, but you can't
  really take that away from him. And that's exactly why this album
  is so unacceptable, coming from someone like him - when you've
  reached superstardom and gone beyond it, you don't release a
  record that's so horribly mixed up and full of second grade
  tracks that it's bound to be a faliure. At least, you should
  expect to hear for it. And hear for it he did, cause the critics
  didn't go lightly on this one. And it's not that bad, actually. I
  mean, that's what I have my program function in my CD-player for,
  and my CD-burner. The album starts on a fair streak -
  Unbreakable, Heartbreaker and Invincible - are all fair tracks -
  below average for MJ, sounds like a watered down selection of
  discarded tracks from Dangerous that were then discarded for
  HIStory and then discarded for Blood On The Dance Floor, and full
  of badly placed guest rappers to top it off - but apart from
  that, if you forget who made this music, these are actually good,
  funky dance tracks. For Michael Jackson they're passable, but
  nothing more. *SKIP* On to track 8 - Speechless - arguably the
  strongest moment on the record. One of only two tracks that
  Jackson actually penned himself, and it shows. The amount of
  emotion in his voice will knock you prone, and actually proves
  very well what the rest of the album lacks: Joy for the music,
  and personal emotion. The lyrics are like a poem, and one of the
  most beautiful love declarations in all their simplicity. Top
  grade to Jackson for this one track, and if you are into his
  music, buy the CD cheeply just to get this track. Track 9 - 2000
  Watts - is another of the stronger moments of the record. This
  one is simply plain fun, and that's another important lesson
  Jackson should have lurned - to let go of the reigns, and stop
  caring whether it's hip or street or down with the trend -
  because it isn't - but this is darn good pop music, and nigh
  irresistable. *SKIP* On to track 13 - Cry - penned by R. Kelley.
  The same R. Kelley who is guilty of writing one of the most
  horrible songs of all times (I Believe I Can Fly, if you had
  doubts), but it seems that with Jackson, he can do no wrong. He
  wrote the endearing You Are Not Alone - major hit in Europe - and
  this track is possibly even better. Oh, forget about the sappy
  lyrics, and just enjoy the wonderfull music. This is pop writing
  in top class, and if Jackson sounds like he takes the Marthyr
  role a bit too seriously, it's still one of the best tracks on
  the record. Track 14 - The Lost Children - is the other song
  penned by Michael alone, and it's not a bad effort - had it not
  been for the children choir and sleezy intro, you could probably
  have ignored the lyrics and enjoyed a nice pop tune. As it is, it
  falls somewhat flat, and becomes completely choking in the end -
  but yes, it's a nice tune. Thumps up, mr. Jackson. Track 15 -
  Whatever Happens. Ok, that's one weird track. Michael Jackson
  featuring Santane. Wtf? Well, kudos for doing this, and it
  actually works, in a sort of absurd way. Not single potential,
  and not a classic, but it's not embarassing, and as an album
  filler, it's completely acceptable as a cureosity. Well, what
  about the rest of it then? Lead single You Rock My World was
  never my favorite - the spoken intro is downright embarassing -
  but the track is not bad. I can accept that on the record. The
  same is not true for the horrible ballads Break Of Dawn, Heaven
  Can Wait, Butterflies, You Are My Life and Don't Walk Away. One
  is worse than the next, and every time I just try to listen to
  them, I start chocking to the degree of loosing my last meal.
  Yes, it's that bad, no really, it's horrible. I. Can't. Stand.
  These. Songs. Period. There are simply no redeeming qualities for
  me. And then the two monstrosities - Privacy and Threatened -
  that just sound like a very - very - bad joke on the man himself.
  Tabloid Junkie from HIStory actually worked, because it packed a
  great punch, and well, had not been heart before. Well it had
  been, it was pretty much the same as Why You Wanna Trip On Me
  from Dangerous, but still. It worked. Ghosts was a good track of
  Blood On The Dance Floor. Forget about the movie that was - well,
  embarassing. But the music was good. These tracks aren't. They
  sound dated, repetitive, out of place and utterly boring and
  uninspired. Get over it Jackson, we don't want to hear more about
  the media nagging you, it's not going to make them go away. Well,
  all in all, what do we have ... To take the album from A to Z:
  Unbreakable - 6/10 - A fair dance track. Heartbreaker - 6/10 -
  same. Invincible - 6/10 - same. Break Of Dawn - 0/10 - Horrible
  R'n'B overproduced. Vomit. Heaven Can Wait - 0/10 - same. You
  Rock My World - 5/10 - well, at least it sounds new. Butterflies
  - 0/10 - more vomit. Speechless - 10/10 - the flower in the dirt.
  One true MJ song. 2000 Watts - 8/10 - Very enjoyable, and stands
  out tall compared to the rest. You Are My Life - 0/10 - even more
  vomit. Privacy - 2/10 - Yawn. Repetitive and dated. Don't Walk
  Away - 0/10 - end of vomit. Cry - 9/10 - beautiful showmanship,
  Kelly + Jackson works - again. The Lost Children - 6/10 - well,
  it has potential. Whatever Happens - 7/10 - interesting, and
  well, refreshing, if somewhat strange. Threatened - 2/10 - same
  as Privacy, and exactly as boring. This yields and average about
  3.6/10, or 2/5 stars, which actually matches my fealings for this
  album fairly well. Yes, I'm harsh, but from a man as gifted as
  Jackson, you just expect more. Quality control next time, please,
  mr. Jackson. On the bottom line: Outtakes The Way You Love Me and
  We've Had Enough showed up on the 2004 Ultimate collection and
  outranked 2/3 of this album by far. Go figure</Text>

  half of the keys were stuck in the up position. I took it out and

  times I was going to have to do this. I decided to test it once I
  fixed it because the toy just looked horribly cheap with very

  <Text category="book">This book is a disappointment. It provides
  little insight into the life or personality of Robert Redford,
  the actor or the person. The book is basically a chronicle of the
  movies RR has directed or in which he has appeared as an actor.
  But even as a filmography the book fails. The reader learns
  little about the creation of each movie or the relationships
  among the actors beyond the anecdotes that have been repeated
  numerous times on TV or in the press. In addition, the authors
  have the annoying habit of consistently putting down Robert
  Redford with snide remarks. There must have been something about
  the actor other than his white teeth and good looks that made him
  an international superstar. For sure, it must be difficult to
  write a biography of such a private person as Robert Redford.
  However, it is the responsibility of biographers to gather
  information and gain an understanding of their subject, and if
  they can't do so, then there is no book</Text>
  <Text category="book">i did a fast skimming through this book and
  noticed that for an Essential Monster Movie Guide, it certainly
  doesn't praise or hype the genre that well. this book comes
  across like it was written by an elitist who's too good for
  horror. nearly every movie/special gets a low rating and i can't
  understand why a book like this that could've been a good
  companion to the horror fan would be so anti-horror as a whole.
  horror fans, in general, want to be be entertained and or
  scared...i for one don't want logical stories and things that
  make sense IF it detracts from the entertainment factor because
  typically what makes sense and uses logic in horror is BORING. it
  gets 2 stars from me because it offers a diverse selection of
  films and includes mini biographies of horror legends like
  Vincent Price, Christopher Lee, Peter Cushing, Lon Chaney, Boris
  Karloff, etc. But for a horror movie book, the writers certainly
  didn't help their genre by bad-mouthing it so much in this
  book</Text>

  <Text category="toys_games">I bought this game for my new family for
  Christmas. This is not at all the Game of Life that I remember
  playing for countless hours as a child. First of all, my old game
  had all of the mountains, houses, and spinner permenantly
  attached to the game board. With the new version, all of these
  things have to be attached with each setup, which takes about
  10-15 minutes and they are easily knocked off the board. Also,
  the spinner is hard to spin and frequently comes off of its
  pivot. The cars are less sturdy and the people pegs do not stay
  in the car so you are constantly having to put the people back in
  the car. Finally, the rules of the game have gotten more
  complicated and yet the meaning of the game has become more
  trivial. I think I will put this in the top of a closet or in a
  yard sale and go find my old version of the game to play in the
  future</Text>
  <Text category="music">Simply put, Jay-Z is incredibly overrated. I
  own a couple of his CDs but to be honest, I never really liked
  him. His beats never grabbed me and his lyrics never stunned me
  so much that I just had to go back and listen to a specific song
  again. He mostly raps about drugs, money and cars. Nothing
  special, nothing new. I'm just being real about it, since
  everyone else is on his d!ck. I think the reason he's so
  respected is because he blew up right after Biggie died and he
  was the closest thing to him at the time. Granted, Jay-Z does use
  some good metaphors, but for the most part his lyrics are
  shallow. Best tracks on this album: Can't Knock the Hustle
  Brooklyn's Finest w/Biggie Dead President</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">I actually saw this movie when it first came
  out, and was so blown away by Robert Downey Jr's performance (he
  was just starting out on his illustrious, if self-destructive
  career) that I didn't notice much else about the movie, certainly
  not Jami Gertz or Andrew McCarthy who are as close to being
  ciphers as it's possible to have on the big screen. (The adults
  in the film are as cipheresque as the kids, so there is no real
  dramatic interest there -- we have only the kids, and their
  interactions with drugs, the party scene, and each other.) Seeing
  it again 25 years later, well ...Downey's performance still holds
  up, but the rest of the movie is less than zero (sorry). The
  director is so absorbed with staging endless party scenes
  (unintentionally hilarious in their excesses) that he forgets to
  give the main characters anything interesting to do, and they
  never develop into anyone we care about. The final scene, with
  McCarthy and Gertz sitting forlornly in a cemetery, has no
  emotional payoff whatever-- McCarthy says come with me to the
  East Coast, Gertz responds yes, I'll go with you, and the viewer
  says, "Thank God, that means the movie's over." Finally, James
  Spader doesn't play a real character either, but as other
  reviewers have noted, he is interestingly slimy as the chief bad
  guy. Glad to see he's still getting work, in a fairly interesting
  role on "Boston Legal".</Text>

  <Text category="music">I remember this album well; you could hardly
  call it a 'barnstormer', as it was released well before "Under
  The Bridge" made them the bandwagon band of the year, but nothing
  could hide the fact that this was a band hellbent on proving the
  critics right--they never had a good album. For every song worth
  listening to ("Suck My Kiss", "Give It Away"), there were at
  least four more songs that should have been discarded. This album
  was and remains a perfect example of why bands shouldn't feel
  obliged to slam 50 minutes of crap onto a slab of aluminum just
  because they can. On top of that, the vocals were pitched and
  pro-tooled beyond belief. Some friends and I got a chance to see
  the band when they were supporting this album, and Kiedis was so
  off-key, it wasn't funny. They drowned their sound in reverb so
  to try and drown out his lousy vocals, but the damage was done.

  <Text category="dvd">Wedding Crashers is the kinda film alot of
  people will love because it is stupid but alot of others like
  myself, won't enjoy. two womanizers fall in love, one because he
  finds out that his gf is not actually a virgin, like first off,
  what does virginity have to do with love? &amp;amp; second, who
  would actually believe that she was telling the truth when she
  said that she was a virgin? &amp;amp; then Owen Wilson's
  character fall in love with Rachel's McAdams character and well,
  that's the usual predictable romance plot. the problem with this
  film is it's not that funny. it seems to think it's better then
  it is. I don't think I hardly laughed during this film. the part
  about the "supposive" gay guy like people think he is gay so
  therefore of course, because it's this kind of film, he ends up
  being gay and of course, he tries to hit on Vince Vaughn's
  character in a scene that is beyond creepy. lets just say that
  "gay" guy is prob one of the worst actors I've seen. &amp;amp;
  then we get a cameo from Will Ferrell, alot of people I know find
  this guy "so" funny. but I don't get it. it just wasn't funny to
  me. u know, I loved the classic, "American Pie" that was just
  stupid for its own good but it delivered the goods to make it a
  great comedy! this film wasn't so much funny as stupid. &amp;amp;
  for the most part, I'm not going to remember this film in 5 years
  from now because it's just an average film</Text>

  <Text category="book">Oh dear. This is another book like the
  horrible "Who Moved My Cheese?" that attempts to manipulate grown
  adults by treating them like children. Like the aforementioned
  "Who thinks my cheese stinks?" (or whatever it is called), I saw
  some people in the organisation where I work trying to sneakily
  weave it into the corporate culture and it lasted about five
  days. It's all about making work "FUN". Yep, work can be "FUN".
  Tell that to the folks who work in hospital waste disposal. Or
  maybe those who deal with animal cruelty cases. Of course, it's
  just great "FUN" to deal with children who have just had their
  parents killed, or folks who just lost their kids. Because that's
  what work is - "FUN" - or so this book would have you believe you
  can convince your workers. Of course in the examples I have
  listed above, it doesn't really work too well, because this is
  really about getting people in perceived lower-end occupations
  like factories or call-centres to believe their mind-numbing
  daily tasks can be "FUN". Myself, I do have some "FUN" at work,
  but probably like many people with more than one brain cell, it
  is based on having a laugh with my co-workers about the sheer
  absurdity of where our work life often takes us. You can call
  this cynicism, which is probably how it would be viewed by people
  who buy into this dumb "Fish"-style "WORK MUST BE FUN"
  philosophy. I'd call it black humour, but it keeps people sane
  and makes difficult work more bearable. As to the title of my
  review - this method of making the workplace "FUN" in a forced
  way is very useful if you have employees that you wish to isolate
  and marginalise. First immerse people in the cult-like atmosphere
  and tell them that they are now to regard work as "FUN". Second,
  let them know that they now "CHOOSE" their attitude - if they are
  unhappy in any way (regardless of them doing their work well or
  not), they are "LETTING THE TEAM DOWN" and not complying with the
  obligation to "MAKE WORK FUN". Third, while the majority of
  victims or workers, however you choose to view your prey, swallow
  the "WORK IS FUN" message and display the behaviour of sea lions
  clapping to get a mouthful of FISH, you can point to those who
  have shown a small streak of individual identity and are not
  HAVING FUN AT WORK and use the Enron-style message that they
  "just don't get it". In this way, the resistant individual can be
  said to be "incompatible with our mission and values", "bad for
  morale" or just "out of step". In this way, the "FUN-LOVING"
  workers, who have now taken on the costume of "FORCED FALSE FUN"
  can be set against them. Of course this will compound their
  unhappiness and isolate them further until they are totally
  marginalised and can be tossed on the scrapheap or forced to
  resign. This book is useful then, if you wish to convince idiots
  that their "WORK IS FUN". Just don't try it on a group of people
  with a brain between them who might take their work seriously.
  They might tell you to stick your "FISH" where the sun doesn't
  shine</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I am a Sci-Fi / Space geek so this movie
  seemed right up my alley. The cast was solid, the director has
  talent, and the story is a true story so all pretty much went
  well...right? Nope. This was a pretty dull film with very little
  believable suspense. The formula kept repeating over and over:
  Something goes wrong + Houston advises + Astronauts do something
  = All is well. Lather, rinse, repeat. Boring, VERY boring. I
  never once flet any real tension except for the initial "problem"
  which obviously was not THAT bad because everything went well in
  the end. The problem is that all of the "issues" the men faced
  were handled so matter-of-factly. Rarely did anyone seem rushed
  or panicked.... it was just yeah, attach this tube to this tube
  and magically everything will be OK. I never felt that the
  astronauts were really threatened, maybe a few times, but only
  for a minute or two. Some reviews claim that this movie was tense
  and riveting.... how so I must ask? Nothing really happened. It
  was not emotional at all since the "struggles" of the men were so
  poorly portrayed. To each his own I guess, but 4 1/2 stars?
  Geeez, just because Tom Hanks is in it does not make the movie
  good follks! The family interactions were pretty standard: Crying
  wife, kids asking questions, annoying media attention, etc, etc.
  Yeah, I could feel for the characters to some extent, but again,
  this movie needed a LOT more real tension and panic to be
  meaningful. I will say that the launch scene was excellent and
  very cool, so were some of the space shots but even those were
  fake with noise and Star-Trekkish special effects. Too bad, I had
  high hopes for this film but was completely disappointed and
  bored. NOT recommended</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">I give this movie an "A" for "avoid."
  Definitely the worst movie I've ever had the displeasure to watch
  (and yes, I've seen "Angel Eyes" so I do have a valid point of
  reference). Chevy plays a guy makin' bacon with Farrah Fawcett
  (yes, I did just vomit) while Jonathon Taylor "Buy a Last Name"
  Thomas plays the petulant little crapface son who is anti-Chevy
  from the start (let's face it, who isn't?) and makes his life a
  living hell. The acting is atrocious, the characters are poorly
  developed and hideously predictable, Farrah's nose appears poised
  to melt off at a moment's notice, and that little brat from "Home
  Improvement" couldn't be more annoying. There is only one moment
  that is midly amusing (when JTT names Chevy "squatting dog" as
  his Indian Guide name), but too bad I heard that punchline in a
  joke my dad told me in 1982. This movie is so bad that when Chevy
  drives his SUV off a bridge while rushing home to fulfill a
  promise to JTT you actually find yourself praying he can't open
  the window to escape. If you enjoy banging your head against a
  wall, eating glass shards, or applying a curling iron to your
  bare skin, this is the flick for you. Otherwise it is pure,
  unadulterated waste that a coprophagic dog would even avoid.

  personally find this so painfull? Well, the whole thing in
  general is quite painfull. First off, the musicians. The whole
  band sound like studio musicians. No obvious indivuality or
  anything new to offer. Then we get to the vocals. The closest
  thing I can compare them to are Alison Moyet or Anthony and the
  johnsons. I don't mind Anthony and the Johnsons, but this guys
  vocals and the music just don't rock. Which is fine. It's ok not
  to rock! But why the hell, being a Tool fan and Mars volta fan,
  was I recomended this? It's bland, it's week, and the dubby bass,
  boring guitar playing/sound... weak vocals.. Actually, forget it.

  to figure. Most of the live stuff is selected from BLS's
  &amp;amp;quot;Stronger Than Death&amp;amp;quot; album, which
  wasn't all that great to begin with. The only good thing being;
  that album was so poorly mixed that live versions of
  &amp;amp;quot;All For You&amp;amp;quot; and &amp;amp;quot;13
  Years Of Grief&amp;amp;quot; sound much better and immediate than
  their studio counterparts. A new heavier version of

  fails by showing Zakk Wylde's gruff vocals don't always work.

  <Text category="book">This book has major shortcomings; Stein's
  obsession with character over plot, for one (Martin Amis said, "I
  used to sneer at plot until I wrote a novel that had one, titled
  NIGHT TRAIN. It was HARD and I used stay awake at night hoping I
  wasn't leaving any holes."), another being his obsession with
  "show don't tell" (Gabriel Garcia Marquez's novel LOVE IN THE
  TIME OF CHOLERA is probably the greatest novel of the 1980's and
  it's almost entirely "tell" and very little "show.") And the
  passages Stein includes from his own novels as examples of good
  writing were actually examples of terrible writing! (A taxi
  "disengorging" its passengers is categorically bad writing.) And
  Stein admits he rejected Frederick Forythe's THE DAY OF THE
  JACKAL. I wouldn't read a book by Dick Rowe about how to make it
  in the music business (Rowe famously rejected the Beatles from
  Decca Records). Stein excuses himself that he was going by only
  an outline, but then Rowe was going by just a demo tape. Better
  writing books are out there</Text>
  <Text category="music">I never really noticed the soundtrack when
  watching this show on television but I love the show so was a
  little surprised when purchasing the album that all the non sound
  bite tracks are American country music songs. Can't say I'm much
  of a fan of American country music so was just a bit
  disappointed. I think a great inclusion on this album though is
  the sound bites from all the leading housewife characters on this
  show and this alone is worth the price of the CD. Was also
  disappointed that Danny Elfman's Desperate Housewives Theme is
  not a separate track and ridiculously has some hidden track
  attached to it. The Desperate Housewives Theme goes for 0:44
  seconds then you have a break of silence for a while but still on
  the same track before at 1:01 a terribly sung summary of the TV
  show mentioning Wisteria Lane over and over again follows for a
  minute and twenty seconds. What ligic was there in not making
  this a separate track? You would then be able to memory it out on
  your stereo. I like listening to TV themes and I find this just
  ruins that track because you need to be near your stereo to press
  skip after 0:44 seconds. This CD is worth purchasing for the
  sound bites alone but I guess if you're just buying it for the
  theme song you'll have to wait for some other new TV theme
  compilation album to get the theme song on its own. This album
  also comes with an excellent cover insert booklet with lots of
  great pictures of characters and scenes from the show.</Text>

  bolt or a john prebble, but instead it was penned by its director
  kenneth hughes, who also gave us such film masterpieces as
  "casino royale" and "chitty chitty bang bang". richard harris is
  his usually unrestrained self, and thats not a compliment. now, i
  wont even go into the politics, which attempt to portray oliver
  cromwell as some sort of liberating hero: as ridiculous a take on
  the english civil wars as alexandre dumas's paean to charles II
  in "twenty years after", but nowhere near as entertaining.</Text>
  <Text category="music">Best of Dark Horse is another half-hearted
  attempt to gather George Harrison's greatest songs together. This
  time we only get tracks from 1976 to 1989. While there are some
  good songs (Blow Away, Crackerbox Palace, Cheer Down, etc.) the
  rest don't represent his best songs from this period. Where's
  Faster, This Is Love, Someplace Else, etc? The only reasons to
  purchase this CD are for the rarities Poor Little Girl,
  Cockamamie Business and Cheer Down. Until they make a true Best
  Of, we'll have to make our own single-disc compilation. Here are
  the tracks needed: Apple Scruffs, My Sweet Lord, All Things Must
  Pass, What Is Life, Give Me Love (Give Me Peace On Earth), Living
  In The Material World, Crackerbox Palace, Blow Away, All Those
  Years Ago, Dream Away, Cloud 9, This Is Love, Someplace Else, Got
  My Mind Set On You, End Of The Line, Handle With Care, Cheer

  <Text category="music">This CD is the worst "comedy" CD I have ever
  heard. Yet the reviews on here mostly claim it was hilarious????
  Ok, I've come to the conclusion, the only people writing positive
  reviews on Amazon MUST be the people trying to sell the junk.
  I've seen this guy on some tv shows, and on comedy central, and
  he's a somewhat funny guy, but it is painful to listen to this
  CD. You can feel the awkwardness of the crowd, not knowing if or
  when to laugh. And it continues throughout the entire CD. There
  don't seem to be any jokes on the CD at all. It is all
  disconnected negative rants from a bitter angry human being.
  Don't believe me? Then go ahead and waste your money on this
  horrible piece of junk, and see for yourself. Like my review
  title says, Do NOT read the positive reviews. Just read the
  negative ones, and decide how credible they seem. Then make your
  decision to buy or not buy</Text>
  <Text category="book">A favourite writer goes to prison, keeps a
  diary which proves to be an enjoyable read, then, upon his
  release, writes the worst book of his career. The concept of the
  book is good, as is the idea to blend the characters into the
  9-11 tragedy. The first 20 pages flow with typical Archer style.
  Then the characters begin to make a series of continuously
  irrational decisions. My personnal favourite is when 2 characters
  independantly consider driving either to Canada or Mexico in
  order to fly to Europe during the 9-11 grounding of air traffic.
  The idea that New Yorkers wouldn't know that Montreal is the
  nearest international airport seem laughable. While there is a
  direct highway to Montreal, Archer sends the main character to
  Toronto which reqires a least 6 different highway changes, is in
  the wrong direction and nearly twice the drive. Once at the
  border, the border patrol guard turns out to be a world class art
  historian who apparantly doesn't know that McGill University is
  in Montreal not Toronto as is claimed by our hero. The guard then
  remarks that he will "meet" a collegue of the hero when that
  peron travels up to the conference. The idea that only one border
  guard is working the dozens of eastern US/Canadian border
  crossings, with multi-lane checkpoints 24/7 is simply the work of
  a mind out of touch with reality. Its fine to change details to
  enhance the plot and structure of a story, but there is simply no
  benefit to this sillyness. Dan Cormie</Text>

  <Text category="music">Sounds like the background music used in the
  70's Rockford Files TV crime show...and a little like the CHIPS
  music too. Similar to music by Tom Scott from back then. The
  crusaders never really get hard funky or dirty funky, they are
  more smooth groovin funk. The sound for the times is very clean,
  too produced for true funkyness. Don't get me wrong I like the
  old 60's JAZZ crusaders, just not this 70's phase of their
  career...they sold out to a large extent, and continue to do so,
  it's where the money is. No improvisatory feel either. This is
  for smooth jazz lovers. hard funk lovers will be disappointed, as
  will true jazzers. I wish the crusaders kept their jazz chops
  from the 60's but they keep burying it like it never happened,
  even to this day, afraid to lose sales if they get too musically
  adverturous like their mid/late 60's true jazz albums. Their 70's
  albums like this are partly to blame for today's smooth jazz...
  in other words, not really jazz, not really funky, just kind of
  smooth groovin, more for casual adults and offices. not
  challenging, not offensive, formulated to an extent. But hey if
  you like this, that's cool, just dont think it's real jazz, or
  real funk. It's smooth and casual, slightly simmers, pleasant
  background music, but doesn't COOK like so many other groups from
  the same time period that mixed jazz, funk, and fusion. It just
  sounds like they are holding back...I know they can play more
  advanced, and write more creatively, they just choose not to ever
  since the 60's</Text>

  unimpressed, to say the least. However, driving on a trip a

  she looks at him as being responcible for the outcome of her
  birth. It was both infuriating and saddening. If you are looking

  considering the ineptness of this way silly film. OK so she

  that her favorite foods are nuts and bolts. Jon Lovitch also
  tries to prop up Ackroyd and this weak script. However, his

  <Text category="book">Hugh Farnham is a blue-collar survivalist who
  likes to play Bridge. His college-age daughter Karen, her friend
  Barbara, his lawyer son Duke, his alcoholic wife Grace, and house
  servant Joe are playing cards at his house the night the bombs
  hit. Everyone scrambles to safety inside Hugh's modern bomb
  shelter. As the bombs fall and his wife is passed out, Hugh
  starts up an affair with his daughter's friend Barbara, right in
  the shelter. As if Hugh's shallowness and arrogance wasn't enough
  to turn you against the protagonist, this nauseating little scene
  will. When the shakes and quakes finally end, the family pours
  from the shelter to find themselves in an impossible, pristine,
  clean world. At first glance, it looks like utopia, but then as
  they settle into a rustic lifestyle they are suddenly set upon by
  an advanced race, imprisoned, and brought into a vastly different
  culture as slaves. Somehow, Hugh needs to find a way to break
  free of the civilization they are trapped in, so that he can be
  free with Barbara. Of all the Apocalypse Fiction, this book is
  the worst. The protagonist is so lowbrow, so arrogant, so
  unlikable, so self-centered, so shallow, so immoral that he
  simply cannot capture any interest. He's not even a "love to
  hate" person. The dialogue is flatly emotionless and yet
  irritatingly flippant, and Barbara and Hugh's constant prattlings
  of "Darling, Dear, and Beloved" do not fit the characters.
  Neither does Hugh's occasional spouting of words like "shall" and
  "shan't" along with racial diatribes that include heavy use of
  the "N" word. There is little emotion from these one-dimensional
  characters even though they face the death of Hugh's daughter and
  Barbara's friend Karen, cannibalism, castration (Hugh cared more
  about his "boys" than he did his real children), pedophilia,
  racism, and $exual slavery, they show no more feeling than they
  would biting into a doughnut. The entire plot-over-plot had a
  contrived and vapid feeling to it, as if the author himself
  didn't quite believe his story. And if he doesn't believe, how
  can he expect the reader to? Overall, there is no depth or flavor
  in this story at all, other than the ugly aftertaste of a musty
  trailer park visit in the dusty twilight, as old men drink cheap
  stinking whiskey and the wind blows over the city dump next door.
  I recommend avoiding this book.</Text>

  <Text category="book">Saw the knock-off series "Jeremiah" when it
  was the classic Star Trek episode "Miri", in which all the adults

  life. Also saw it as the Canadian TV series "The Tribe", in which
  all the adults are killed by some sort of plague. Also read it in
  "The Kindling", by Jennifer Armstrong, a novel in which teenagers
  must care for the younger kids after a virus wipes out their
  memories and kills all adults. I laughed when the Amazon reviewer
  called the premise of "Jeremiah" "intriguing". Well, the other
  works don't have Luke Perry or pretty F/X. Maybe that's the
  "intriguing" part of this latest adaptation of one of the most

  It isn't a question of country music, or contemporary music, with
  ELH she has demonstrated throughout the years she just loves, and
  respects, GOOD MUSIC. The music is good, the woman has impeccable
  taste but this time I had wished she sat in on the mixing
  process. I think I understand the aim of this collection but
  geez, I wish I didn't. I am too accustomed to hearing ELH's clear
  voice slice to the heart of the lyrics, take them and present
  them with a totally unique perspective. I won't start on her own
  playing because this review would be nothing but gushing about
  her near-total mastery of her craft. She's an amazing woman,
  artist and collaborator -- I love her because she is everywhere
  in music: supporting new artists, doing background for others,
  her duets are gems of generosity with respect for her fellow
  artists, while always doing what's best for the song. I just hope
  there's no follow up to WB. I'm very happy with my other 8 ELH

  party lines up with what we believe in screw the fact he had to
  cover something up. I can't fathom why we continue to fall for
  this all the time, and believe me I don't feel it's right to air
  it all over the news either. I feel that it comes down to the
  man, and if he does have the values his/her party believes in
  then he will do the honorable thing, and own up to his/her
  mistake. This movie is just another nail to drive into the
  justification that it's alright to cover things up, and there are

  <Text category="music">Van Dyke Parks did the arrangements on Sam
  Phillips's debut 'The Indescribable Wow', an album I love so much
  I thought I'd give 'Song Cycle' a shot. What a feeerocious
  disappointment! I'd give it zero stars if I could, but amazon
  wouldn't let me! My god, that singing voice of his reminds me of
  David Bowie... "The Laughing Gnome" Bowie, that is... I've seen
  the word "coy" pop up in a lot of reviews to describe his
  singing, er, style, but I'll go them all one better... "smug".
  All I hear in it is "Ooh, I'm so smart. What a clever lad am I."
  The arrangements or orchestrations, or whatever you call them are
  all pointless. It gives me the feeling that Van's dad bought him
  an orchestra and said, "Here, son, have fun." So young Van did...
  without ever really learning how to use it properly. Randy Newman
  KNOWS how to use an orchestra; check out his best album 'Sail
  Away'. The arrangements are tasteful and, key word here, SPARE.
  He never clubs us over the head with them. The lyrics, if we can
  call them such, have no attachment whatsoever to the music....
  but then again since I wrote that the arrangments are pointless I
  guess it's to be expected. So, what we have is a trifecta of
  awfulness: bad voice, bad lyrics, and bad music. HOWEVER, he did
  make 'Song Cycle' in 1968 and worked on 'The Indescribable Wow'
  in 1988... so he did learn a thing or two in 20 years, namely
  that arrangements are NOT songs; they're used to highlight a
  certain verse or chorus the singer really wants to put across to
  the listener... maybe Randy pulled him aside once to tell him
  that...</Text>

  <Text category="book">Just wanted to quickly say I haven't finished
  it yet, I am only on page 20 but already this book seems very
  overrated. The author dives straight in talking about going
  beyond the five senses to achieve spiritual consciousness, but
  this is nothing new and we are not even given any background on
  how the author developed his views. Instead, he strides
  arrogantly forward as though he is the ultimate, conclusive
  authority on spirituality, and it's very aloof and, actually, not
  an enlightened approach at all! I've just started the chapter on
  Karma and it's really starting to smell like just another mish
  mash of other people's opinions clothed as quasi-originality. It
  looks like I'm going to continue reading with a very cautious,
  vetting attitude toward the text. The fact that this was a
  bestseller only serves to show how genuinely interested people
  are to develop their spiritual consciousness - and how easily
  authors such as Zukav can cash in on their hopes and fears. Hey,
  that's the material world for you!</Text>
  <Text category="book">I seem to be in the minority, but I did not
  enjoy this book at all. The main character is, of course, the
  "only female to ever survive becoming a werewolf" but this was
  only the start of her amazing speshulness. I felt the plot got
  swallowed up by the author's need to self-insert and 'play' in
  her world, and the only reason I finished this book was that I
  was on a plane and had nothing else to do. The plot fishtails
  several times, and isn't all that interesting to start with. In
  short, I was left with a bad taste in my mouth concerning the
  author in general, and will likely skip her books in the

  <Text category="book">The advice in this book is solid and
  appropriate for most kids. However, the writer's attitude is
  judgmental. If you are buying this book, it's probably because
  your child's eating has not gone as smoothly as you'd like. For
  most of us, a lot of our parental self-esteem is wrapped up in
  this issue. So it just makes no sense to act as if it's usually
  the parent's fault - why alienate and beat up your target
  audience???? Plus, while I'm sure that some parents contribute to
  kids' eating issues, plenty of kids are just born more sensitive!
  If you can read between the lines and get to the take home
  message without letting her attitude get to you, more power to
  you - otherwise, go elsewhere.</Text>

  <Text category="book">This book was recommended by someone a lot
  more financially successful than I am. But while I was reading, I
  kept asking myself, "When's he going to get to the point?" The
  first part of the book is all about why it's good to be
  rich--something I thought was unnecessary. The bulk of the book
  is filled with anecdotes that try to illustrate the different
  mindset of rich people as compared to middle-class and poor.
  Finally, in the last part of the book, he gives some practical
  examples of what he considers to be good investment strategy.
  This was the only part of the book I was interested in. To me, it
  was like his publicist told him that no one is going to buy a
  30-page book on investing and so Kiyosaki wrote what he knew
  about making money and filled the rest with "fluff". However,
  even his advice is considered questionable by many experts. I
  would say that the main idea I got from this book was to try to
  look at investing from different angles and not to just follow
  the crowd. I just wish I hadn't invested so much time in a book
  that could have been a lot more concise</Text>

  <Text category="book">If you believe in the Devil, and I mean
  *really* believe in the devil, I can't think of one good reason
  why you'd want to summon the Devil into this world. At worst,
  he's purported to be the father of lies, and one of the fallen
  angels. This means that anything he tells you is suspect,
  anything he gives you is suspect, and he probably has the power
  to make you believe in him. Yikes. Not a safe trip. Not a
  terribly sane trip, for that matter. Yet that is precisely what
  Boris Balkan (Frank Langella) desired. He had one copy of "The
  Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadow", and there were three
  extant. One or all of these books is a forgery, and one or all
  holds the secret to summoning Satan. He hires Corso (played a bit
  too understated by Johnny Depp) to research the other texts. The
  movie is based on the novel "The Club Dumas" by Arturo Perez
  Reverte, which I favorably reviewed. I can't give a similar
  review to The Ninth Gate for a number of reasons. First, Depp's
  portrayal of Corso was one dimensional, and Corso was a
  multi-dimensional character. Whether that's the filmmaker's fault
  or Depp's I don't know, but Depp's Corso was a dreadful bore. A
  mysterious girl appeared and became an ally of his, demonstrating
  supernatural abilities. We are never given ample evidence as to
  why she might have had an interest in helping Corso, or in what
  her abilities might have been (never mind her identity). Yet
  since this is a character from the book, I know why she was
  there, I have a pretty good idea who she was (and good job to the
  author on how he handled that!) and her character's interests and
  abilities could have been better communicated, with very little
  difficulty. Also, in a rather silly departure from the book
  (departures are fine...I'm not being a book snob), they
  substitute an average sized platinum-blonde haired black male for
  a character in the book who was tall, white, and physically
  imposing. There's nothing that irritates me more than a "quota
  substitute". I don't think this particular sub had any speaking
  lines, which makes it that much more of an insult. I love
  intelligent thrillers. (I didn't care for The Da Vinci Code.)
  This was a thriller that spent time in libraries, that examined
  woodcuttings drawn, perhaps, by Lucifer himself - yet I wasn't
  engaged. In 1999, when the film was released, I couldn't sit
  through it. After reading The Club Dumas and then discovering
  that there was a connection between the two, I approached the
  film again, hoping that understanding where the book was coming
  from would help. It did not. In fact, it raised more questions. I
  would give this movie 2.5 stars and round it up to 3; however,
  I'm reviewing the DVD and the DVD gets a big spanking for not
  having subtitles. There's no excuse, in this day and age, for a
  mainstream DVD not to offer subtitles.</Text>

  used it that I immediately ordered a second one (for what I

  that the wiring was indeed much thinner than other pads, allowing
  it to conform to the shape of my body. However, the first pad
  lasted only two weeks before failing to heat. I returned it to
  HomeMedics and they ignored me. The second one lasted nearly a

  <Text category="dvd">I understand that some fans would like to see
  more of their loved characters (this series is one of the best as
  far as I'm concerned), and I can understand the need in filling
  in a gap especually if the show hasn't been aired in a while on
  TV: but I cannot understand ANYONE who buys this DVD for ANY
  reason. You do not need this DVD to "fill the gap in your
  collection." They did the same thing with Chobits in episode 7,
  another damn recap. There's no point in watching it. The series
  is great, stick to the episodes both before and after this DVD.
  Trust me, I know how tempting it is to either rent this episode,
  get it on NetFlix, or go out and buy it outright... but don't.
  You'll only be sorry. There are a myriad of reasons why the

  <Text category="music">...but this album should never have been
  released as the "final" Queen-album. A couple of these songs
  should instead have been added as bonus tracks to one of those
  many Best of Queen-releases. "A Winters' Tale" for example. Do I
  know much about the background for "Made in Heaven", well perhaps
  not. But I know that this is known to be the last studio release.
  Sadly it has the sound of elevator-music all over, not that the
  melodies are bad, it just sounds... almost cheap actually -and
  most importantly to my ears (at least) this doesn't sound like my
  Queen. One of the most important bands in the history of music
  saying good-bye with "Made in heaven"? Was this really Freddie
  Mercurys' wish? It doesn't make much sence after the fantastic
  "Innuendo" released in short time before his tragic death
  containing the haunting ballad "These are the days of our lives".
  The words and the music... wow! And the music video to this song,
  have you seen it? To me that was the real good-bye with Freddie,
  and with Queen. And it has the sound of how I will remember them.
  But is "Made in Heaven" really that bad? Yes, and no. "Heaven for
  everyone" by Roger Taylor made it sound promising, and don't
  forget; I was exited when I heard about "a final
  material"-release. But it turned out, as you might have guessed,
  far from what I had expected. Old songs from B-sides and
  solo-albums are mainly fillers for this album... I mean honestly?
  "Too much love..." then quite a resent hit from Brian Mays'
  solo-album "Back to the light", I remember thinking "What's the
  point?" And it actually sounds better from his solo-album without
  the synth dominating the song here. Don't get me wrong now,
  Freddies' vocal is as good as you'd expect, it's what they've
  made out it that surprises me. And what makes me wish they
  hadn't. At least not for an entire album. "A winters' tale" is a
  positive surprise though. Perhaps not Freddies' best song, and
  not better than "These are the days...". But it's a celebration
  of the beauty in life. At least it sounds like that to me.
  Freddie captures a moment of harmony and peace. And beauty. And
  it sounds like a classic Queen-song! "A beautiful day (intro and
  reprise)" functions well too. But what tracks 12 and 13 are about
  I have absolutely no idea..? I wish they would have ended the
  album with Freddies' last "Yeah!" on the song. I wish... So all
  in all; "Innuendo" remains the explosive good-bye with the "real"
  Queen. At least it does to me. (Let me add that the cover of
  "Made in Heaven" is perfect for the title, and somehow amazingly
  "seals" in its' simplicity the fate of the band with Freddie in
  the lead. The three band members left (Brian, Roger, John) facing
  the sunset, and a statue capturing Freddie in a remembarable
  style on stage. Reminding me of him at Wembley 86. To me this
  actually expresses something beyond words, and it's impossible
  not to get a bit of an empty feeling watching it while listening
  to "Heaven for everyone" or "A winters' tale".)</Text>

  "...after spending a half hour with that book, GODS' MAN. I

  of emotions, including hatred for the author, disgust at the

  After we spoke, I sent her my newly purchased copy and she called

  Both were double record hit soundtracks. Both represented youth.

  soundtrack. When the best songs are by Billy Squier and Sammy
  Hagar you know you're in trouble. Jackson Browne, Joe Walsh, Don
  Henley are each awful. So were the GO-GO's. Not surprisingly Don
  Felder and Jimmy Buffet both sucked. I almost fell asleep in
  route 128 traffic when Graham Nash played. The band that called
  themselves Poco can't be the same Poco I grew up with. There were
  some listenable tracks by Timothy B. Schmit, Louise Goffin and
  Stevie Nicks but then there's Quarterflash. However, amongst all
  this crap was a gem...the very last song is Goodbye Goodbye by
  Oingo Boingo. This song rocks and Danny Elfman sounds crazed.

  <Text category="book">Sometimes a reader knows more about a narrow
  subject than the author. When the author is in error about that
  subject, the reader may question the accuracy of the descriptions
  in the rest of the book. Such is the case here. I've written 123
  books; several on parachutes and skydiving. I am a pilot,
  skydiver and parachute rigger; I know the sport and the industry.
  The author wrote: "We use flat chutes as parasails." What is
  "flat"? Square? Rectangular? Ram-air? A "parasail" is a kite and
  is usually under tow behind a boat. This sentence does not make
  any sense. "Four miles up, he pulled". That would be 21,120 feet.
  The use of oxygen is not mentioned. "Ferocious, out of control
  spiral. One of the cells collapsed." The collapse of a single
  cell will not cause a fast turn and the cell is easily
  re-inflated. "Corkscrewing caused the other cells to collapse."
  Not likely. "Guide lines" An uncommon reference. They are
  referred to as control lines or toggles. He jettisoned the main
  canopy at 15,000 feet. He freefell ten seconds and opened his
  reserve at 12,700 feet. The rest of the team on this HAHO jump
  would still be at 18,000 feet. "Five minutes later." He would be
  at about 8,000 feet. "He estimated he had about 15 minutes of
  glide remaining." More like eight minutes. "He was so relaxed, he
  was startled to hear canopies fluttering all around him and the
  sound of men splashing down just under him." How did they all
  beat him to the landing area? They were 5,000 feet above him.
  Fiction writers have a responsibility to make their descriptions
  accurate. When a reader finds obvious discrepancies in one area,
  it makes him or her wonder if the rest of the book is accurate.

  <Text category="dvd">Granted, I saw this movie at about three in

  seriously subpar performances from pretty much all involved, and
  the script was just awful. Gosh, it's hard to believe I actually
  sat through it. It was just so... exactly what it was, I guess. A
  stupid sex comedy that's absolutely terrified to be anything
  else. The thing that really pushed this above the radar for me to
  blip at was the truly offensive tone of some of the material. I
  think my real downfall here was the fact that I'm a gay guy whose
  friends are mostly straight guys. The scenes regarding a certain
  character and his chance encounter with homosexuality are so
  repugnant it's almost ridiculous. Now, I'm not one to get
  offended easily, but this just took it a bit too far. Just the
  attitudes and behaviors expressed by most of the characters just
  made me depressed, which isn't really something I look for in a
  movie. It just seems to me that if 'gay' had been replaced with
  'black', this would have been deemed racist and probably wouldn't
  ever have been released. Not that I'm condoning censorship, but
  when your tone becomes so... mocking, I guess. Oh well, I guess
  all I'm trying to say is I will definitely not be repeat viewing

  <Text category="dvd">The flight into New York had been a long one;
  but I was gently revived when Kirsten Dunst met me at the
  airport. She was to be my escort that night at the Lincoln Center
  where the President would present me the Distinguished Writer's
  Cross-the highest award this nation can bestow on an author. I
  quickly slipped my only suitcase in the backseat and sat next to
  her as she drove her Mercedes S class sedan to the Waldorf
  Astoria downtown. "I have to admit that I didn't you who you were
  until I read STARLESS GRASSLANDS. I don't mean to embarrass you;
  but that book changed my life." I tried to be polite and gracious
  toward the compliment. For the remainder of the trip we had a
  nice conversation while I approved the fluid motion of her hands
  and legs as she maneuvered the controls of the automobile. I very
  much approved of her legs. As I departed the car, Kirsten leaned
  toward the open door to catch my eyes. "Don't forget. I'll be by
  at seven so we can go to the ceremony together. Please be ready."
  I expressed gratitude for her generosity and promised to be
  waiting for her seven sharp. The hotel staff greeted me and soon
  I entered the elevator for a quiet ride to the eighty sixth
  floor. As I entered the suite, the steward took my request to
  have my suit blushed, prepared and returned in a few hours.
  Finally, a bit of peace. I poured a small measure of whiskey into
  a chilled tumbler and then walked over to the large window
  looking out over the city below. For a few moments I contemplated
  the remarks I was to make at this evening's formal ceremonies,
  then I heard the hushed movement of stocking feet behind me
  across the room. I turned around and out of the bedroom to my
  left in walked Sandy Bullock dressed in a black sheer see through
  cat suit. "Well, Crabby, aren't you glad to see me?" Before I
  could recover from my surprise another set of feet wisped across
  the floor from the sitting room on the right. It was Jennifer
  Aniston dressed in the same black sheet cat suit. "Sweetheart,
  don't look at her. Come here to me." "Get out!" screamed Sandy.
  "No, you get out. It's not fair. I left Brad for him so I get
  him!" The two of them stood in angry silence staring at each
  other for a tense moment. Then Sandy leapt at Jennifer and
  instantly they were in a bitter fight hissing and scratching each
  other. It was a ferocious sight as pulled hair, shrieks of pain,
  and nylon tearing could be heard. Then almost a quickly as it
  began, the fighting pair disappeared into the sitting room.
  Several sharp punches were heard then a definite thump as a body
  fell to the floor. Sandy marched back into the room victorious. I
  ran to the door of the sitting room only to see Jennifer laid out
  on the floor out cold, spread eagle and naked. Before I could
  think of what to do Sandy tapped me on my shoulder. I turned
  around and there Sandy stood. A little worse for wear. Trying to
  catch her breath. Nude with her torn cat suit draped across her
  feet. "Forget her. She won't bother us now." Sandy brushed the
  stray hairs out of her face, smiled and stepped out of her nylon
  costume. She posed standing and anticipating my admiration. "Now
  I'm all sweaty and warm. I need a shower." Sandy turned her lithe
  body and walked into the bedroom and into the bathroom beyond. I
  turned around and wondered what I should do for poor Jennifer
  still laying unconscious on the floor. Then I heard Sandy
  calling. "Crabby, why don't you come and help me? You could soap
  up my......" OOPS!!!! Sorry!!! Err...just a little fantasy of
  mine. I meant to honestly review this movie but my more realistic
  nature took over. I swear my pitiful fantasy is actually much
  better than the story told here. You see, the cover of this DVD
  displays Ms. Bullock prominently with her name in big font
  letters. But in truth this movie focuses on Tate Donovan as the
  main character and only on Ms. Bullock as his unlikely love
  interest. As much as I "love" Sandra Bullock, I have to admit her
  filmography has not been kind to her. Her best films have been
  WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING, WRESTLING ERNEST HEMINGWAY and the
  much-unappreciated HOPE FLOATS. Unfortunately for each of these
  gems are several terrible movies like FIRE ON THE AMAZON,
  HANGMAN, SPEED 2 and this movie. The plot revolves around two
  "losers in love" who are unappealing both in looks and
  personality. Donovan comes across a love potion from a gypsy
  woman (an unrecognizable Anne Bancroft) and soon both Donovan and
  Bullock have the most desirable members of the opposite sex at
  their feet. All goes well until others find out their secret and
  Donovan and Bullock discover that their true love is actually
  between each other. The story is predictable and unfortunately
  not very funny or all that sweet. Chances are you can find a copy
  of this DVD fairly cheap and it is not a bad way to kill some
  time while you're waiting for your own boyfriend or girlfriend to
  get off work-or your friends to wake up from their naps-so you
  can really do something worth wild.</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">I saw this movie and I found it both shocking
  and choking. It displays children as young as 4 years old smoking
  cigarettes! Did the filmmakers take into account the damage
  tobacco could have done to these child stars? (Yes, the
  cigarettes and the smoke were real, not CG.) I think they should
  have omitted such scenes from the script, because it displays a
  behavior that's not only illegal in several countries, but also
  threatening to both society and childhood. No matter what the
  other reviewers thought about the movie, I give it a disgusting
  1, and this is the last movie I ever watch that depicts smoking
  children. To those that haven't yet watched this movie, please
  DON'T WATCH IT, unless you want cancer to win the health wars.
  And here I hand out a lesson for every active or aspiring
  moviemaker: if you want to depict smoking children, use COMPUTER
  GRAPHICS instead of the REAL THING</Text>

  sultry vocals and powerhouse notes highlight her entire album,
  Cole's raspy voice and sometime-y pitch concern me. Aside from
  the obvious car banger "I Just Want It to Be Over" and the wildly

  <Text category="book">I am an avid fan of true crime books and this
  is by FAR the most one-sided book I've ever read. It wasn't about
  the crimes, it was about this author's personal feelings and
  dislike of Aileen Wuornos. He has a real problem with women,
  lesbians in particular. He made Ms. Wuornos out to be someone she
  wasn't. She had a hard life, yes and chose to committ crimes, but
  that wasn't what this book was about. Again, it wasn't worth the
  $. I actually threw my copy of this away</Text>
  <Text category="health">Although I have used many electronic cuff
  devices in the past, this is one of the worst at providing
  accurate readings. Firstly, the cuff is not adequate for very
  small or larger wrists and the readings are often lower than what
  you would get if the blood pressure were taken manually the
  traditional way. In a clinical setting, it is important that you
  get adequate readings so that the patient can receive the proper
  treatment based on their readings. It is imperative since you may
  or may not give medication depending on what you recive via the
  blood pressure measurement. I have taken a blood pressure
  manually after getting what I considered a questionable reading
  only to discover that the wrist blood pressure was far too low
  and more aggressive measures had to be taken because of the data
  that was retrieved the old fashioned way. Imagine had I taken the
  initial reading as truth and the patient may have had a stroke as
  a result. As a rule, I never recommend using these devices for at
  home use because of the risk of false readings. Many people who
  suffer from hypertension feel that this is a good way of
  monitoring their blood pressure when in actuality it is giving
  them a false sense of security. If you are considering buying
  this product for at home use or for use in a clinical setting,
  please ask your doctor or nurse for their opinions.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Gotta love the flashback to the sixties that
  is reflected in every scene of this movie (of course, it was just
  a product of its time--the mid-60s--it's not a film trying to
  recapture the era..it IS the era). Still the storyline is slim
  and the going slow. Interesting scenes appear here and there. The
  parts are definitely better than the whole. There's an intriguing
  idea in here it just never gets developed as it should. Actually,
  thinking about it in retrospect is more interesting than watching
  it was. It's subtle, I'll grant you that. And a nice character
  study....and yet....? We were counting the minutes left in the
  film by the end ("Only 25 minutes left in the film and then we
  can get back to our lives!") so that's not a good sign</Text>
  <Text category="health">I have very thick, very coarse, wavy hair.
  When my two year old CHI straightening iron broke, I needed to
  replace it quickly! Locally the only iron I could find was the T3
  Tourmaline iron, so I thought I'd give it a try. It cost more
  than the CHI, was sold at a fancy salon, and could even be used
  on damp hair. Surely it would be a good replacement.
  Unfortunately, it failed to impress. -It did not leave my hair
  silky smooth. While my hair was certainly straighter, it still
  looked coarse. (This was on the hottest setting and with several
  passes over the hair) -Because my hair is so thick, an iron needs
  to reduce the volume. The T3 failed in this respect, too. -I
  thought I would like the larger (almost 2") iron surface. The T3
  has a perfectly flat surface, which made it impossible to get a
  flip or curl on the ends. Needless to say, I returned it quickly
  to the pricey salon and will be getting another CHI! Perhaps this
  brand would work better for someone with fine hair, since the
  temperature can be adjusted</Text>

  how can I trust the rest of the information in the book? Avoid

  <Text category="dvd">"Cursed" is the most pathetic werewolf movie
  I've seen since "An American Werewolf in Paris". The acting is
  terrible, directing is poor (Shame on you Mr. Craven) and the
  storyline is largely uncompelling. The werewolves look ridiculous
  and the whole movie really comes off as a total joke to a
  sophisticated adult horror movie audience. This movie seems to
  cater to the teens and early 20s people who might think something
  like this is "cool", but if you're looking for a scary movie,
  don't look for "Cursed". Well, at least it's not as bad as "An
  American Werewolf in Paris", but that sure as hell isn't saying
  much.</Text>
  <Text category="music">I like Meav's voice, and this CD is OK, if you
  like this kind of stuff. Think slow and somewhat depressing. I
  think Irish music has moved on so much since Bill Whehlan of
  Riverdance brought it into the modern times, and came up with
  this vocal sound, I guess to hark back to earlier times, which
  worked well because Riverdance has so much contrast in it and the
  choir songs only appear as relief to the other music. This is all
  a bit samey and dull. I would say saved by this lady's fine voice

  receive it in time to wrap it and mail it to Texas in time for
  Christmas. I ordered in on the 27th and received it on Dec. 1st

  Asian doll but not the one with the ponytails...this doll had
  short hair. I called Amazon immediately and although they
  expressed being sorry they said that they could not guarantee
  that it wouldn't happen again. I have used Amazon before with no

  <Text category="book">Sorry. I hate to pile on, but I must agree
  with Lit Teacher on this one. The thinking was sloppy and
  contradictory, and the writing was wooden, stiff, irritating. I
  bought it a few months back and hid it in a drawer until I could
  get around to it. I pulled it out today with a smile and high
  hopes. Boy was I disappointed. I thought maybe I was having a bad
  day. Maybe my concentration was off. So I pulled out Truman
  Capote. Smooth as silk. So it wasn't my fault. It was Ron's. I
  finally decided to scan the book, and that revealed there was
  really nothing new here, nothing interesting. I wish I had not
  wasted the money. I must be more careful. But, as for this book,

  <Text category="music">I was anxious to hear an astounding modern yet
  retro dance disc from one of my favorite girl groups of the 80s.
  Unfortunately, instead of picking up on the latest influence of
  80s music in dance music, what we get here is predominantly disco
  flavored tracks that sound painfully dated, with some Latin tones
  now and then. The only semi retro/electro tracks on here (and my
  favorites) are Feel For You, Love Bite, Your Love is Like a Drug,
  and Marc Almond's remix of Venus. The two lead singles "Move in
  My Direction" and "Look on the Floor" are not even the strongest
  tracks! And the remixes on their singles don't make them much
  better. I appreciate the commercial direction the girls have
  taken, but you can still sound mainstream while being more
  sophisticated than this. Take a listen to the new Madonna or even
  the Kelly Osbourne(!) to hear some infectious melodies with an
  80s flair that don't melt down into total cheese. Unfortunately,
  I just don't see US radio embracing any of the sounds on this
  disc. But of course, fans of Bananarama should still add this one
  to their collection. It's listenable, if not up to today's
  standards</Text>

  shaver and decided to upgrade. Bad idea! After shaving with it,
  it looks like I have a day-old stubble. No matter how much I
  twist and press it, the "new super system of blades designed by
  no one other than Gillette" does a bad job. This morning I
  actually pulled my old 6520 out, shaved off as much as I could
  with this "360 Complete" garbage, and then used 6520 to see how
  much "clean up" it would do. The difference was both very visible

  <Text category="book">In his recently published history, The Whiskey
  Rebellion, William Hogeland attempts create a revisionist history
  of the late eighteenth century Whiskey Rebellion in Western
  Pennsylvania. What Hogeland accomplishes is less history and more
  diatribe in the vein of Howard Zinn. He has an axe to grind, and
  by the end Alexander Hamilton is the devil incarnate, and those
  who openly contemplated secession and committed acts of violence
  against property and people were just trying to bring the
  American Revolution to its necessary conclusion. The accusation
  that Hogeland comes back to again and again is that Hamilton
  incited the rebellion. The argument is that because Hamilton's
  patently unfair whiskey tax was the impetus behind the
  frontiersmen's resistance, and his unreasonableness in enforcing
  the tax and issuing writs for the arrest of those who refused to
  pay the tax caused the rebellion. The problem with Hogeland's
  argument is his scholarship, or lack there of. He almost never
  offers a direct quote, especially when accusing Hamilton of
  malfeasance. Instead, Hogeland offers his summary of primary
  documents with nary a footnote. The reader is expected to accept
  on faith the author's interpretation at face value with no way to
  check the facts except a ridiculously useless bibliographic essay
  at the end. Not all of this is Hogeland's fault. The new trend in
  historical works intended for the popular market eschews
  scholarly footnoting, opting instead for endnotes that provide
  little more than an opportunity to name drop. Even Doris Kearns
  Goodwin, a legitimate scholar, is guilty of the succumbing to
  this new endnote craze. Ultimately, this is the main problem with
  William Hogeland: he is not a scholar. He is a magazine writer
  with an agenda, and no scholarly background to legitimize his
  preposterous conclusions. To read some radical agenda into the
  actions of the Pennsylvania farmers is the very worst revisionist
  history, because there is no basis in reality.</Text>

  <Text category="toys_games">3 Stars overall ONLY b/c we LOVE c3! Read
  on... The batcave C3 set has some rather intense structural
  integrity problems that cause it to be next to impossible to put
  together without a supplemental "fix-it" set that was distributed
  by the mfg. after many SEASONED ADULTS protested their
  frustrations with its construction. Since the company has now
  withdrawn all c3 items from its website, it is not known whether
  the "fix-it" package is still available (it included thicker,
  stronger support pieces for the first floor, and additional
  pieces for a stairway support column). Without these, the set
  tends to implode well before you ever get the 2nd level
  completed, let alone the 3rd! After all the problems started
  surfacing, the company also increased the "recommended age range"
  to 7+ from the previous 4+. If you purchase a box that states 7+
  as the age range, it SHOULD include the "fix" parts (no
  guarantee, we're only assuming), but even with the "fix" pieces,
  it is still a major headache to put together, and your true
  calling is an architect if you manage to get it safely together
  on the first try. It takes most adults several tries over several
  days (due to frustration stress level) to get this piece fully
  assembled. There is a step-by-step construction guide showing the
  problems (with "crash" pictures) in set construction, Amazon
  rules say I can't post the link here, but it shouldn't be too
  hard to find if you enter c3 batcave in a search engine, the full
  write-up is in a c3 forum. I know many people may still
  purchase--it is after all, Batman, but I would at least try to
  see if you can acquire the replacement parts before ordering, as
  you will have much greater chance for success. OR wait until you
  get the package, if it says 7+ on the box, you just may be in
  luck. In the alternative, maybe you could use super-glue to the
  existing inadequate structural supports? OR, raid your kid's Lego
  stash and use thicker, more stable blocks than the ones supplied

  the stupid adults. The first 30 minutes showed some nice
  locations in and around Durango, including the steam train
  (that's why I purchased a used copy) but then it goes into time
  travel to save Ouray from becoming a ghost town and the movie
  becomes a stupid bore, intended for young and undemanding
  children. Don't bother unless you love Durango as much as I
  do</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">The only reason I gave this movie a star was
  because there is no Zero star option. Where does Seagal continue
  to get backing for his movies - the last 8 (or 10?) have all been
  awful. His last good release was Under Seige. I only wish my 401K
  grew as fast as his waistline. Submeged is bad - no suprise
  there, it will be the last movie of his I watch, I just can't
  take it any more. Submerged? Must be a reference to his movie
  career which went under about a decade ago</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This complete waste of 90 minutes is probably
  the strongest contender ever for a lone-star movie. With
  cringingly awful acting, laughable special effects (the
  ridiculous head in a bucket is a real guffaw moment), appalling
  dubbed dialogue, cheesy music, inconsistent and confusing plot
  and no tension or atmosphere, The Grim Reaper is a total
  disaster. Don't waste your money on this turkey.</Text>
  <Text category="book">If you work in a comic book store, live in
  your mom's basement, own a lot of black candles, and think that
  H. P. Lovecraft wrote history books, then you might like this
  garbage. If you have a life, a clue, or a girlfriend, then you
  probably will not have any use for this stuff. I still can't
  figure out how record companies get away with classifying this
  pseudointellectual fluff as metal. It belongs in a category with
  Sisters of Mercy or Morrisey. This record is completely lacking
  any imagination or energy: depressing teenagers is like shooting
  fish in a barrel. I guess if you want to play dungeons and
  dragons and fester about feeling like an outcast, this would be
  the thing to listen to. Personally I think it's a huge ripoff
  when somebody takes five minutes worth of music and stretches it
  out into an hour. Don't give these jokers your money.</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">As the reviews below indicate, "Arthur" has a
  lot of fans -- when it was released in 1981 Vincent Canby of the
  New York Times found it a wonderful "screwball comedy" (although
  over time, Times readers, perhaps more discerning than Vincent,
  have only rated it 3 out of 5 stars) and Bravo listed it #10 on
  its list of Best Comedies (see below). I first saw Dudley Moore
  in "Foul Play," thought he was very funny. Based upon that, I
  bought "10" and "Arthur," as it turned out a downward trajectory.
  What I dislike about "Arthur" is Moore playing a loud, obnoxious
  drunk telling unfunny jokes, and Minelli playing a
  salt-of-the-earth working girl who loves Arthur for himself, not
  for his $750 million fortune. Even John Gielgud, who was great in
  "The Loved One" a much better comedy, can't resurrect this
  turkey. Okay, folks. Start casting your negative votes. In the

  <Text category="music">I liked this when it first came out b/c I was
  16. I was a rebel, wanted to be part of something different. This
  is their best work since the weirdness does get lame after a
  while. Favorite song is Mongoloid...totally strange but rocking
  song. "Uncontrollable Urge" rocks (in a weird way) and Come Back
  Johnny is almost a conventional song. Satisfaction is completely
  unique but its not a good song. The group was obviously trying to
  do more than music and develop a KISS, multi media, making money
  kind of thing. I saw them live (they were horrible) during their
  hey day. The most interesting thing about them is while other odd
  bands were eventually accepted and integrated into the
  mainstream, DEVO is still as odd of a group as ever. Mark
  Motherbough does a lot of soundtrack work (Rugrats) and you can
  hear the DEVO in all of his work. Anybody that gives this novelty
  group 5 stars is cheapening what true excellent music is. DEVO
  came out as a Goof, not as serious musicians. They got big in the
  70's b/c they were part of the new wave and kids (like me) were
  looking for alternative music that we can claim our own.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">im a huge fan of writer Sean Mcginly, his
  classics include Venomous starring Treat williams and Sonic
  Impact with Ice-T. Mcginly's films are the topic of discussion at
  film schools all across the world, he is a renowned talent and i
  have to say that i was appalled when i saw his latest film Two
  Days. i think he should stick to writing as the film was
  virtually without direction and the cast (which included hacks
  like Paul Rudd) was not in the same league as superstars Traci
  Bingham and Ice-T who have graced some of his previous work.
  Please Sean, stick to doing what you know best and stay away from
  the intellectual stuff, leave that to idiots like Capra, Wenders,
  Scorcese etc. They are not in your league.</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">This film sucked harder than a boatload of
  whores during shore leave. I originally saw it for free and
  afterwards, I still felt screwed. It stank so badly that I
  checked the soles of my sneakers on my way out of the theatre.
  Yeah, I know. Call me "Mister Tact". A "horror-comedy" that's
  neither slightly funny nor remotely scary, this film is a
  supposed sequel to the 1981 horror classic "An American Werewolf
  in London", (which is possibly the best werewolf film ever made).
  The filmakers had a lot to live up to and, boy, they blew it in
  every department. The effects were ludicrous, the cast was lost,
  the script was bathroom tissue with identity issues, and the
  director should have been shot (with something other than lots of
  narcotics). This film is a textbook example of the Hollywood
  machine clanking its way through a total goatscrew. If you have
  already been suckered into buying this DVD, I feel your pain. You
  are undoubtedly now using it as a coaster for a Heineken or as a
  tool to chisel old dingleberries out of your asscrack</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Over Priced, Cheaply made, Bad assembly
  instructions. It's a good Idea, but a bad product. Very over
  priced. I would not have mined losing out on ten dollars, but 50

  my son for Christmas. The bat does not fully swing, because one
  of the guides block it. you can't control the so called pitching,
  the ball is a magnet that sticks to the playing field. pitch it
  to the bat and it may not roll to the bat, hit it and it may not
  make it out of the out field. Score board dials won't stay
  attached to the paper score board. It takes two people to
  operate. it's the day after Christmas and this one is going to
  the trash. I can't send it back because I have attempted to
  assemble it. It would have to go back in the same condition it

  <Text category="music">Most people seem to like the soundtrack
  from"Glory",but this fact does not necessarily make"Glory"a
  great,or even good soundtrack...Most people also like the food

  favor of thier menu as being good or great based on numbers...It
  is something to put in one's mouth whenever nothing better is
  available and one is hungry...The same might be said
  regarding"Glory"...If one's tastes run to choir music,almost any
  gregorian chant album is head and shoulders above the insipid
  choir music to be found here...As for the themes,they are
  commonplace variations,often bootlegged from other scores by the
  same composer,or new work that the composer later bootlegged into
  other scores,so,all in all,the effort plays rather like a buffet
  offering at a cheap,"homestyle"diner...The film,on the other
  hand,was well done,and,apparently,from reading many of the other
  reviews here,the unwarranted praise owes more to satisfaction
  with the film itself,rather than very much stand-alone praise for
  the score.Horner has written a lot of really,really beautiful and
  original scores,but perhaps because most of his best efforts have
  been for small or little-noticed movies these have not been
  recognised for thier greatness...So,in sum,we are left with a
  very popular film,provided with a very mundane score by an award

  <Text category="book">A good friend of mine insisted I'd read this
  book, because she knows I love exploring the spiritual aspects of
  life. In the end I was very disappointed. Not in the writing or
  the exploration aspects of the book, but Michael Crichton's whole
  attitude. He would spend a chapter sharing his learnings and his
  eye opening experiences, only to revert back to his arrogant,
  narrow-minded attitude once again for the next chapter. How can
  anyone claim they've learned anything in life when nothing they
  learn from it seems to sink in? Sadly, this book left me with a
  very bad taste in my mouth. I have no desire to read any more of
  his books</Text>
  <Text category="book">Isn't it frustrating when a book spends a lot
  of time building up the problem-to which you say,
  &amp;amp;quot;Yeah! yeah! That's me!&amp;amp;quot; and then gives
  you no answer, or a weak one to which you say, &amp;amp;quot;No
  duh!&amp;amp;quot; I'm afraid this book is one of them. The title
  is misleading because you assume he will help you find the life
  you've only dreamed of, or at least point you in the right
  direction to get started! But I was left depressed after reading
  it because it basically says that God gives us desires that we
  can't have on earth so that we will long for Him and Heaven. I
  don't believe that's the abundant life Jesus promised. So I went
  to the Bible. (I should have gone there first!) I looked up every
  time it talks about desires and got my answer.
  &amp;amp;quot;Delight yourself IN THE LORD and He WILL give you
  the desires of your heart!&amp;amp;quot; Ps. 37:4 So I set out to
  seek Him. I started reading &amp;amp;quot;Knowing
  God&amp;amp;quot; by J.I. Packer and began to get answers to all
  my questions about desire! I hope you'll find them too-in

  <Text category="dvd">Yup, definately the worst Halloween movie.
  Come on, Michael on a reality show? Ha! What the f**k does that
  have to do with the series? Not only that, but the plot is
  completely pointless, the acting sucks, and Dr. Loomis and Jamie
  are nowhere to be found in the movie! Not only that, but the
  movie relies way too much on gore to be scary, and therefore
  comes off as pretentious. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE gore in
  movies, horror or not, but any knowledgable Halloween fan knows
  that the Halloween movies were always scary without the gore.
  Along with Halloween 3 (which actually had nothing to do with
  Michael), Halloween: Resurrection reigns as the worst movie of
  the series. There are a many more problems with the movie than
  the ones I listed, but I'm tired of typing, so I'll let other
  reviewers explain why it's so bad. Bottom line, watch ANY
  Halloween movie other than this or Halloween 3</Text>

  in all, I was disappointed and still don't know what PERV means.

  <Text category="dvd">Like many of the reviewers here, I am an Anne
  Rice fan. However, I knew that there were going to be liberties
  taken and was comfortable with them. I mean, few of the "Dracula"
  movies throughout the years have had anything to do with Bram
  Stoker's novel. All I wanted - and expected - was a flashy, no
  substance guilty pleasure movie, a la "Dracula 2000." That alone
  should tell you my expectations. But QotD failed even as a guilty
  pleasure. The storyline didn't make a lot of sense when taken on
  it's own, and the acting was bad to bland. I also take issue with
  the badly-done look of the vampires. Rice's vampires are supposed
  to be beautiful, whereas this bunch looked like Eurotrash or
  people at a Halloween spook house. However, one good thing about
  this movie is the music videos for Lestat. SInce the videos are
  included on the DVD, it earns 1 star</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This Joe d'Amato film takes the Women in
  Prison genre one step deeper into the abyss of sleaze, bordering
  on pornography. The plot, or lack thereof, is typical: woman goes
  into jail undercover to unearth the guards corruption. To make
  the film last 80 minutes, Joe d'Amato fills the story with
  lesbianism, vile tortures, naked women in rat infested sewers,
  and plenty of gratuitous sex. I gave this movie 1 star because
  there is no option for a 0 star rating. Even hardcore fans of
  Euro sex queen Laura Gemser will find this one a total

  royally. It is a little under 3 hours, which seemed like 3 days,
  and there is only about 20 minutes of decent film. The small
  amount of story that is somewhat portrayed is simply stepped on
  by asinine porn. The most triumphant scene in the movie is where
  the Roman soldiers attack the phallus-humbling papyrus stalks
  while flailing their genitals to and fro. This movie is
  ridiculous. In order to enjoy this, one must be completely

  <Text category="dvd">The first half of this movie starts out
  promising; the 2nd half is not so good. It becomes slowly
  predictable and stereotypical, whereas it started out charming
  and promising. Of particular annoyance is the ending, where we
  find the hackneyed politically-correct stereotype of the husband
  having to admit culpability for all the wrongs of the couple's
  separation, and the woman never having to admit her half of the
  bargain, despite the fact that she was clearly as poor a
  communicator as he. Indeed, the wife's character is strikingly
  uneven in this movie: her personality appears to be one thing in
  the first half of the movie, but she seems to become a whole
  different person by the second half. Quite inconsistent</Text>

  there wasnt much to make this unrated. If your expecting to see
  frontal or rear nudity, forget it! The nearest thing is teenage
  guys running around in tight calvin Klein undies. However, if
  your someone who likes to use your imagination, this might be for
  you. One good thing about this flick is a pre Charmed hottie Drew

  and put the batteries in and all it did was whine and we were
  petting the head and chest hard. After about 3 minutes I did get
  it to bark then another 3 minutes later I got the tail to wag but
  the leg wouldn't shake for another 3 minutes. 20 minutes of
  trying to get it to do any thing at all it finally licked but the
  tongue was not wet and I did put water in it so it should have
  been wet. Then my daughter got mad because she couldn't get it to
  lick again. The dog doesn't even stand up like it appears to be
  doing on the box.. it just lays there. If you are buying this, be
  prepared to be paying for a highly priced stuffed animal because

  matter must be missing from this book. Or else how can he take
  physics out of context and make such fantastic leaps to religions
  parallels that he knows little of. He even twists the religion
  around to serve some unknown purpose. Many people say they did
  not understand physics until this book; Surprises, you still do
  not. You now know what Zukav wished physics was. Take anti-mater
  for instants that does not mean the opposite of mater. And the
  relationship between particles has no correlation with the
  relationship of dogs and cats. At least get it straight before
  mixing it up. Try reading some of these: "The Ascent of Man by
  Jacob Bronowski". The book available everywhere the DVD's
  available from the UK. "The Upanishads" by Eknath Easwaran
  (Editor), Michael N. Nagler (Photographer) Or just about any
  mainstream material on physics and religion. Then if you still
  want to mix worlds into one read someone saner: "The Tao of
  Physics: An Exploration of the Parallels between Modern Physics
  and Eastern Mysticism" by Fritjof Capra. Also on the fringe but
  not as radical as Zukav is a series called "What the Bleep."

  <Text category="music">No one questions Lyrics Born's talent, which
  can be matched by few. His breakneck delivery will make you swear
  they sped him up in the studio, except then if you go see him do
  it live (recommended: he is a charismatic performer) you realize
  they didn't. The problem with this release is not, therefore,
  Lyrics Born himself. It's just that there's not enough
  interesting things happening around him. There are handful of
  standout songs on this record, but there is no excuse for it
  running as many tracks as it does. The skits remind me why I
  sometimes think the whole idea of skits on CDs tired itself out
  in about 1997, if not earlier. Worse, the fillers sound similar
  to the hits but less memorable, making the whole album kind of
  drag, and the grooves, guitar licks and keys, all of which are
  good in small doses, become sort of flat after a time, especially
  when Joyo Velarde isn't singing backup vox. Surely a few of the
  songs could have become B-sides on the single, or something,
  instead of bloating the album itself. Do That There, Rise and
  Shine, and One Session are my favorite tracks, the ones I would
  say go buy from the iTunes store or something right now. There's
  nothing wrong with the rest, I just don't find myself listening
  to them much. I like the concept of Later That Day but it should
  probably take less time out of the day to listen to</Text>
  <Text category="music">This was one of the most dissappointing debut
  albums to come out of the Mid Nineties G-Funk heyday. Warren G.
  didn't even produce one song on this sorry attempt at making
  hard/soft gangsta rap except for the title track that was already
  used on his album a year before. The skits are ridiculous, the
  music is halfass, and the lyrics are amateur. There is absolutely
  nothing that keeps the listener's attention for a whole album.
  This is similar to other West Coast rap albums that play it too
  safe such as W.C. and the Madd Circle's debut and Coolio's "It
  Takes A Thief". One star for the hit single "Summertime in the
  L.B.C.".</Text>

  <Text category="music">I bought this album on the strength of
  positive reviews and personal charts displayed on amazon.com and
  amazon.co.uk. These suggested that Eloy's Silent Cries and Mighty
  Echoes album was redolent of Pink Floyd and Yes. Actually it is,
  but only both bands at their very worst. The album opens with an
  inept attempt at Gilmouresque doodlings circa 1973, moves on to
  some truly rank singing, with the singer's phrasing hardly
  assisted by a strong German accent and thus the suspicion that he
  doesn't understand the absurdity of the lyrics. Actually, at
  times the lyrics do remind one of Jon Anderson at his silliest,
  although we forgave Mr Anderson and Yes because they were superb
  musicians and songwriters. With Silent Cries &amp;amp; Mighty
  Echoes the tunes are pooor and for progressive rock, the song
  structures are of almost childlike simplicity. That this album
  was made in the late seventies is extraordinary in itself. It
  would have been appalling in 1972. To discover it was recorded in
  December 1978 is gob-smacking. Unforgiveable tosh</Text>

  <Text category="music">I like most of AC/DC's music, but I can't
  stand their latest album Stiff Upper Lip. Stiff Upper Lip is the
  only AC/DC album where you can play it all the way through, and
  not even hear one good song. Stiff Upper Lip doesn't even come
  close to being as good as Back in Black or Highway to Hell. Every
  song on it just bugs the heck out of me. Listening to one song
  off this album is enough to test my patience; but enduring all 12
  of these musical abominations is enough to drive me crazy! The
  overall sound is very similar to their earlier albums like
  Highway to Hell or Back in Black. BUT...those CDs had variety,
  they were semi original, and they were actually pretty good. THIS
  CD is just completely worthless. I have heard some cra ppy CDs in
  my lifetime, but none of them were more pain to listen to than
  this. The vocalist sounds about 10 times worse than he did on
  their earlier albums, the music is chunky, repetitive, dull, and
  boring, and most of the songs sound the same. Stiff Upper Lip is
  so bland and dull sounding that it sounds more like the
  monotonous droning of an electric fan than a rock n roll band.
  The music is so repetitive and similar sounding that its more
  like listening to the same annoying song for 60 minutes than 12
  separate tracks. This CD is just unbelievaby terrible. It is a
  disgrace to this band's legacy, and the band members should be
  embarrased by it. Oh well, I guess they probably only made this
  album because they needed to fulfill their record contract, so I
  guess they don't care about how awful it is anyway. All I can
  tell you potential buyers is to stay as far away from this piece
  of garbage as possible. It is a TOTAL piece of cr ap and it is
  not fit to listen to. Go buy a GOOD AC/DC CD like Let there Be
  Rock, High Voltage, Powerage, Highway to Hell, or Back in Black.
  Stiff Upper Lip suc ks so hard it leaves a big purple bruise.

  review it fairly. It seems I liked it even less than reviewer Ms.
  Trieste "CF", below, but I am in general agreement with her
  points. There are just so many things wrong with this book that
  even the grating "famous names" don't really stand out for me.
  Let's see, where to begin: the naive political ranting, the
  unspeakable dialogue, the corny love interest, the wholly
  implausible technology, the absurd coincidences, the
  distractingly disjointed structure, the proliferation of minor
  characters, the talky explanations of the detective's thought
  processes, the total incompetence and corruption of the police -
  I can't go on; it's hackneyed and poorly written, and that's all

  <Text category="music">I bought this album because I loved the title
  song. It's such a great song, how bad can the rest of the album
  be, right? Well, the rest of the songs are just filler and aren't
  worth the money I paid for this. It's either shameless bubblegum
  or oversentimentalized depressing tripe. Kenny Chesney is a
  popular artist and as a result he is in the cookie cutter
  category of the Nashville music scene. He's gotta pump out the
  albums so the record company can keep lining their pockets while
  the suckers out there keep buying this garbage to perpetuate more
  garbage coming out of that town. I'll get down off my soapbox
  now. But country music really needs to get back to it's roots and
  stop this pop nonsense. What country music really is and what it
  is considered to be by mainstream are two different
  things.</Text>
  <Text category="health">Poorly written and not edited. It will confuse

  <Text category="dvd">There are certainly some memorable scenes in
  this film, but as a whole it just didn't quite work for me.
  Vlastimil Brodsky is indeed a talented and endearing actor but
  spends the whole film playing the same stock character: Fanda, a
  maddening yet adorable grandpa, oh-so-young-at-heart,
  oh-so-mischievious and impish, but somehow oh-so-good-hearted and
  harmless that you can't help loving him warts and all. In fact,
  that's one of the fatal flaws of this movie: the lack of any dark
  side to any of the characters. They're all basically harmless
  Walt Disney types, even the bumbling and self-absorbed son. There
  are no real consequences to Brodsky's actions other than Stella
  (his wife) finally talking divorce but it's obvious almost as
  soon as the words are out of her mouth that she'll come back to
  him. There is no center, no force or dynamic power in this
  film---it's like a limp wine that you tolerate because you don't
  want to hurt the feelings of your host. The ending also relies on
  another lazy device, the virtual deux ex machina in the person of
  Stella suddenly transforming into a spirited accomplice/supporter
  of Fanda's when she sees that his attempt at self-reform is only
  making him miserable. This film might've been much more effective
  and poignant had it spent more time dealing with Fanda's
  desperate fear and avoidance of dealing with old age and death,
  instead of focusing on how clever, audacious and adorable of an
  elderly madcap he is, which makes much of the film reek not only
  of kitsch but even worse, narcissism. One wonders if the director
  was just so awestruck at the chance to work with Mr. Brodsky, who
  is a towering figure among Czech actors, that he decided to turn
  the film into a bit of a hagiography of him. A more accurate
  title for this movie, especially given the ludicrous ending shot
  as the credits roll, might be: "The Fantasy Life of a Poor Old
  Man."</Text>
  <Text category="music">Young Jeezy even proclaims not to be a rapper;
  yet, he is a motivational speaker. So, in this case, he is trying
  to speak to the youth of hip-hop culture that selling drugs and
  carrying guns is the cool thing to do. He should just consider
  himself a rapper; that way, when he's using grade-school rhyme
  patterns to get his message across, we can just call him a bad
  rapper instead of a bad role model. Anyways, with that diatribe
  aside, this album is nothing new from Jeezy. We all saw it
  coming. He picks out some great beats, but cannot provide the
  great lyrics to go along with them. Therefore, an uneven album
  ensues. "I Luv It" was the first single and is a prime example.
  If this beat might have reached someone such as T.I. or maybe
  even a group like Clipse, this would've been a great song.
  However, it's Jeezy, so it's gonna be a letdown. That's pretty
  much what this album is; a letdown. After guest spots on "Grew Up
  a Screw Up" with Ludacris and the posse cut remix "Top Back" with
  T.I. &amp;amp; B.G., i was expecting alot from Jeezy this time
  around. However, all i got were two tracks ("Go Getta" with R.
  Kelly &amp;amp; "3 A.M." with Timbaland) that are recommendable.
  The rest of the album is plagued with horrible lyrics over
  average-to-above average production. If you're looking for
  "inspiration," look away from this "trap-star.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I hate to admit I actually own this thing on
  VHS. And unless my mind is going more than usual, I have this cut

  to be the way of DVD. We get at least four issues of Terminator
  2, but none of Robinson Crusoe on Mars. I personally am sick of
  it. Director's Cuts, Unrated Editions, and other snaky ways of
  trying to separate my money from my wallet. No wonder I've taken
  to borrowing nearly all my DVDs from the Public Library. No, you
  generally don't get them the day they come out. But honestly,

  after listening to the samples (the reason for purchasing both
  these albums) and I certainly hope it sounds nothing like 'Up in
  Flames'. It's funny, I promised myself I would never buy an album
  again without listening to it and yet it seems that samples on
  the net can be misleading, either that or Dan Snaith has had a
  serious identity crisis in the last few years</Text>

  Stop Here if you plan to view the entire Film. The Premise: A
  group of stupid Eco Terrorists raid a research facility in
  London, even though warned by a researcher, release some highly
  agitated but otherwise normal looking chimps who then attack and
  infect them with a fast acting ( within Seconds ) virus that
  transforms them into insane, red-eyed murderous really fast
  creatures who attack and infect other normal humans through bites
  and even scratches. One drop of their saliva or blood can infect
  you. The Plague is let lose ... The Hero: Cut to a skinny kid of
  about 110 pounds with a dopey beard laying naked on a hospital
  bed, it`s 28 days later and he wakes up, but no one's there. He
  then wanders around an empty London, in hospital scrubs, looking
  confused, yelling " HELLO !! " , " HELLO !! " There are no bodies
  outside, and nothing that looks like the remains of one. There
  are almost 15 Million people in Metropolitan London. Where did
  they go I asked myself ? The Supporting Cast: He then wanders
  into a Church, and finds it full of what looks like sleeping
  people, he yells " Hello !! "at which time some start screaming
  and rush at him, in the close-up it`s clear they have Turned and
  he slugs the Creature-Priest Thing with his bag of Coke Cans. He
  gets out , more Stuff Happens, eventually he meets smart and
  tough Selena (Naomie Harris) armed with a matchete and Mark (Noah
  Huntley), armed with a steel bar, who have avoided infection and
  explain the situation to the dim whitted Hero, who turns out to
  be a Bicycle Messager Boy who lives with Mum and Dad. Seems the
  Creatures come out mostly at Night. Mostly. Hero insists on going
  Home, Mark &amp;amp; Selena tag along. We find his very middle
  class Mum &amp;amp; Dad peacefully dead in bed from an overdose
  of Booze and Pills. Guess they could not live in a World Without
  Telly... More talk and moaning and tears from Hero who very
  unwisely lights a candle at night which naturally draws an attack
  by some Nasties, more fighting, bad guys are killed by Selena and
  Mark while Hero cowers on floor. Mark gets infected, denies it,
  but is chopped by Selena who " can see it in his eyes ". Damm
  Girl! if I`m ever in a Zombie Movie I want you along ! Day 2
  comes, the pair then wander aimlessly though London chatting away
  about everything but how to deal with the threat and survival and
  at this point I start thinking; wouldn`t it be a good idea to get
  some Guns ? preferably full auto, with a lot of Ammo. I mean,
  although the Creatures are fast, they are stupid, don`t run in
  packs and make a lot of noise and can be killed and stay dead.
  Police Stations and Military bases are all over London, probably
  deserted , and filled with Guns....but this doesn`t seem to occur
  to our wandering charactors who trust to a Baseball Bat &amp;amp;
  Machette which you must get close to use....emmmm. I start
  squirming a bit in the seat, and for the first time look at my
  watch, but it`s still kind of ok. So far, it`s still a tight,
  well made interesting film, with the bloody action well filmed
  and important to the story line, and mostly believeable in it`s
  own low buget Post Apocolypitcal setting with taut dialoge that
  holds my interest. Maybe there a reason the Hero is cast as
  Stupid, or will he grow and learn through experience ?, maybe,
  but it better be soon because we are almost 30 minitues into the
  Film, and it`s getting real hard to identify with him. Or care.
  The Suporting Cast 2 : Night Falls. Our pair see flashing lights
  on the top of a High Rise, much action ensues, they find more
  survivors, just a average working type Dad Taxi Driver and his
  young daughter. More Talk, seems they are out of water and there
  is a radio broadcast giving direction to go North where the Army
  ( who usually have Guns ) has set up a Secure Area. Works for me.
  After some debate on whether it better to stay where they are,
  isolated, in fact trapped on top of a Building, with no water or
  power or food or real weapons until overrun by Zombies, or travel
  North to safety , in Daylight and safety ( remember, the Monsters
  don`t operate in daylight ) this Group of Dopes reluctantaly
  decide to go North, in a taxi, with no guns..( remember Rule # 3
  of Zombie Films: Gun Are Good )..and at this Point In Time this
  heretofore good film starts to move rapidly downhill in
  believablity. The Journey of the Dumb: Piling into Dad`s hack,
  loaded with junk as if going on a Brighton Holiday, with all,
  even tough Selena giggling and laughing, off they go. When faced
  with the choice of driving through a Dark tunnel , where it is
  obvious that they could be trapped and killed, or another safer
  route, they naturally chose the Tunnel. Stuff Happens. Stopping
  to get gas, the Hero wanders alone into a dark, confined space
  for no real reason, armed only with a Baseball Bat. More stuff
  happens. Stopping for the night, they decide that a picturesque,
  open field with a few low stones is a great spot and preceed to
  ......You Guessed It! Start a Really Big Fire and go to sleep
  with no one on guard. I`m not making this up folks..!! Nothing
  Happens. However they do get to see a Family of White and Black
  horses running free, and it`s clear that we are no longer
  watching a Horror / Action Film, with some internal logic but a
  trite " Message Film " . They reach the Army Blockade, but no one
  is there, in spite of dead everywhere, they proceed to split up
  and wander around this perfect ambush site for a look see. More
  stuff Happens. After this, the stupid illogical stuff comes fast
  so this is a good stopping point. At the end we learn from the
  crazy and sadistic Army Major ( aren`t they all though ) that the
  Goon`s can`t farm or feed and will likely starve because of it.
  Think about that one. We also learn that the Virus is contact
  borne, NOT Airborne, think hard about that one Dudes ! Since it
  started in one local it`s very unlikly to have spread thoughout
  England in 28 days....big Plot holes, dumb ending, 110 pound
  Stupid Hero becomes Arnold The Terminator in 10 mintues. Girls
  decide it`s far better to die a gruesom death then Put Out and
  Lose Their Honor to what looks like a bunch of boy scouts in
  Cammos, who are their only protection... really dumb stuff after
  an excellent start. Sad....this was a really superior film for
  the first 20 mintues.</Text>

  <Text category="book">I loved the first Carole Matthews novel I
  read, "For Better or Worse", and picked this up in an airport
  hoping to be entertained once again. It kept me entertained while
  on a three and a half hour flight, but only because I didnt' have
  anything else to do. I am the type of person who has to finish a
  book once they start but it was really hard for me to even pick
  this one up again after getting off the plane. I totally disagree
  with the premise behind the whole thing and found it completely
  pointless. There were no redeeming qualities and few parts in the
  book even worth mentioning. To me, Matthews expects you to feel

  given this album 2 whole listens an it still sucks ass. Besides
  if I should have to listen to something more than a few times to

  enough you will like it. It's human nature... Keith, ummm...
  Excuse me " Dr. Octagon " is a retard, mentalcase, and has no
  lyrical ability. Half of you people like this just cause its so
  different. What he says makes no sence, and has no meaning. That
  which he does say that does make sence is nasty, and weak. His
  flow is awefull. His delivery is AWEFULLL. Automator does a good
  job on the boards making nice beats, but Keiths lame ass f***s up
  good beats... Feel free to click that you dont agree with this

  <Text category="music">Wow! Tom Morello, Flea, Pete Yorn, Chris
  Cornell, Brad Wilk, Maynard James Keenan. When I first heard of
  this superstar line-up, I was sure that this CD was going to be
  awesome. I was duped like everyone else who bought this album.
  Axis of Justice (or so cleverly put by a previous reviewer as
  "Axis of Jackasses") is really a bad album, even for a bunch of
  political liberal rockers. Serj and Tom really dropped the ball
  with this one. What could've been a festoon of awesomeness turned
  out to crap-fest of whiny musicians with an equally crappy
  message. Knowledge, The Night Watchmen, and Ahmed Ahmed are among
  the many reasons why this is so bad and incredibly difficult to
  listen to. The song,"Jeffrey, Are You Listenng?" is up there with
  other crappy songs like John Mayer's "City Love" and Richard
  Harris' "MaCarthur Park." On top of all that, the communist
  entertainer known as Michael Moore adds his little nugget of
  wisdom on the DVD, which I can say I've become dumber now that
  I've listened to it. For the love of all good music, stay far
  away from this CD</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">There is a pattern in Hollywood when it comes
  to drama/revenge films such as Eye for an Eye. It is an extremely
  simple pattern that is regenerated time and time again because
  audiences like to not be surprised. They are prepared for the bad
  guy to die at the end, whilst the victim or top-billed
  actor/actress comes out as the hero at the end. It is meant to
  give us a sense of security and comfort, but for this critic it
  is getting old. Eye for an Eye is a perfect example of film that
  falls deep within that tired genre of film. From the opening
  credits of this film, you could count the steps that each actor
  was going to make all the way to the very end. The pauses could
  be guessed, the lines could have been written the night before,
  and the acting was nothing short of mediocrity at its best. It
  was guaranteed that the actors would be overly dramatic, the
  violins would always shrill around Kiefer, and there would be
  horrendously underdeveloped plotlines that would lead nowhere.
  This is your typical revenge film with no excitement, no frills,
  nothing that would make it stand out from the rest. The late
  director John Schlesinger played it safe with one of his final
  films, which will promise to bore and completely not satisfy you
  to the bitter end. Where did Eye for an Eye go wrong? I don't
  think I need to count all the ways for you, but some of the
  bigger issues that I had with this feature was the complete
  unknown of the characters. I have major issues with stories that
  escape realism to allow the main character to seem more dramatic.
  What was Sally Field's job? I know that is a small detail, but it
  better highlights my complaint that our central family (the
  McCanns) were not as developed as I would have liked to have
  seen. I had no clue her daughter had a stutter until two seconds
  before her death, yet it seemed to be a bigger key element as the
  film progressed. Ed Harris literally walked through his
  character, proving that Field's husband could have been played by
  a plastic bag and still seen the same level of emotion. The only
  character worth watching, and was developed briefly, was Kiefer.
  He was 100% evil in this film and it kept this film geek worth
  watching until the very end. Yet, we didn't even know that much
  about him either (which upset me). Schlesinger obviously knew the
  story that he was about to tell with Eye for an Eye very well,
  the actors I believe even knew the story and they probably didn't
  even need to read the script, and the story played it safe from
  the beginning, but it wasn't what I wanted to see. I expected
  film like this to come out during the 80s, not in 1996. It was
  pathetic to see name actors like Ed Harris, Sally Field, Phillip
  Baker Hall, Keith David, and Kiefer Sutherland walk through this
  film like it was a fly in the pan. Nothing stood out in this
  film, nothing made me want to rewatch the brutality of it, and
  nothing made me feel excited about these actors. This was a
  literal "nothing" film. It lent nothing to the cinematic world
  except (and I stress this a bit) another peg in a very tired
  genre known as the "Revenge Thriller". After watching this film I
  said to my wife that I thought Sally Field was completely
  overdramatic throughout the course of it, overplaying the small
  parts and completely exploding the bigger elements, which made me
  think of a High School drama production. It was amateur at best,
  but she said that is why directors use Sally, because she is
  known for being overly dramatic. This is a pure example of a good
  thing gone badly. Sally saw success with it once, but as she
  continues it only creates bad cinema. There were times during
  Sally's bigger speeches that I found myself laughing. I couldn't
  help myself, but her focus on certain words and
  clichï¿½ reaction to others just seemed cardboard
  instead of lifelike. The same could be said for Ed Harris who
  obviously has discovered that he doesn't have to play the
  outlaying father any further in films. He was completely wasted
  in this film. Was there any emotion with him? I didn't see any.
  Then there was the pitiful contribution by Hall and David that
  begin with intrigue, but were dropped faster than a big ole sack
  of potatoes. Also, did Mantegna take a class on how to be a
  one-dimensional clichï¿½? Urg, his portrayal of
  the police office was a disgrace to those that genuinely play
  one-dimensional police officers. Again, the only actor worth
  watching was Kiefer because he not only spoke with evil, but
  demonstrated that he was capable of anything vile. It was his
  sole performance that made this film decent to watch to the end.
  If I have to talk about the story I think I am just going to go
  mad myself. Field over dramatized the entire film, thus creating
  uncertainty amongst the viewer. Did Kiefer get a bad image
  because he was bad or because Field wanted to see him as evil?
  That could have been a great avenue for this film to travel, but
  alas, ole safe Schlesinger didn't take us down that darker path.
  I needed more to develop what Hall and David were doing at the
  support groups, but it seemed like that story was dropped rather
  quickly as the ending needed to be wrapped up gently in a comfort
  blanket for viewers. This was yet another dark avenue that was
  not explored. I felt as if I saw these dark avenues with the
  director and the cast, yet we chose to stay on the lighted path.
  That, coupled with the poor acting, just created a film that
  didn't catch my attention and fully contributed nothing to the
  cinematic world. Overall, in case it wasn't obvious, this wasn't
  a good movie at all. In fact, I could go through the rest of my
  life without thinking of this movie again. I thought only horror
  movies had the stated Scream rules and somehow could stick to the
  same tired pattern over and over again, but with Eye for an Eye
  it became obvious that it the "Revenge Thrill" fell into that
  same pattern. The only trouble is that horror films actually have
  fun with that repetitive structure, this film did not. Sally
  Field was horrible and should really consider a strong
  independent film to bring her back to the spotlight, while
  everyone else was forgettable. The only fun part was watching
  Jack Bauer play the epitome of evil. Watch this film for Kiefer,
  but nothing else. Skip it! Grade: * out of ****</Text>

  <Text category="toys_games">A friend of mine has Zombies!!!, also by
  Twilight Creations. I've played it a few times, and found it
  pretty enjoyable. Zombietown is sort of a followup to this in
  some ways, and tries to expand the strategy of the game somewhat.
  Unfortunately, it ends up far too confusing and complicated to
  make for fast gameplay (it's often very slow, in fact), and the
  strategy is more shallow than Risk. Ya know the stereotypically
  confusing instructions of insert Tab A into Slot B? That's pretty
  much what the instructions to this read like. They're fairly
  poorly written to boot. There were also a couple problems we ran
  into the rules didn't seem to cover. I can't recall them off the
  top of my head, and they didn't come up very often, but it was
  still irritating. Overall, definetly not reccomended. At $40 in
  stores, and $35 off Amazon, it's also a HUGE ripoff. What do you
  get in the box? Like 100 tiny army men-esque figures, a couple of
  packs of cards, and a laminated piece of cardboard. I understand
  why it is expensive, as I'm sure this was a low budget item and
  such, but Zombies!!! was much less expensive.</Text>

  she begins unleashing secret desires and so forth with her sinful

  <Text category="dvd">The Quiller Memorandum takes place back during
  the cold war. It represented a time and place in history that was
  true at that time. It accurately depicts an era that is now gone,
  that some of us lived through. The movie, by today's standards,
  is a little disjointed and incomplete.It jumps to a conclusion
  but lacks story development how it got there. Some scenes must
  have been edited on the cutting room floor back in the 60's or
  70's in order to get a G or GP rating. As a result of those
  incomplete or cut scenes, part of the movie makes no sense. The
  movie would have been better served if it were produced closer to
  the author's original book. The most memorable part of the movie
  is the haunting score, including Matt Monroe's "Wednesday's
  Child". I was disappointed in viewing this movie again some 20 or
  30 years later. Perhaps Wolfe was right when he said that we can
  never go home again. Quiller must have gotten lost on his way
  home!</Text>

  <Text category="book">I remember hearing about this book by the
  great patriot Sean Hannity sometime in 2001, then it was a mere
  idea. From that time on, until August 20th 2002, I waited for
  what I thought would be the greatest book of all time. I remember
  seeing the cover art and hearing about the title: "Let Freedom
  Ring" with not just a picture of Sean Hannity on the cover,
  patriot that he is, but also a flag. I loved it, couldn't be more
  happy. Well, the day of the book's release, I took a day off work
  (i've never missed a day of work before in my life), and rushed
  to get this book. It looked better than I ever imagined. With the
  flag on the cover and the title of "Let Freedom Ring," I thought,
  finally, technology has caught up to our patriotism. I expected a
  book filled with flags, flags with sound effects. Maybe some
  firework sound effects. Boy was I wrong. I opened the book only
  to the colors black and white. No red. No blue. No stars and
  stripes. I quickly turned the pages, looking, searching for
  flags. I found none, no sound effects either, no fireworks. At
  that point, I went into a 4 year long depression. I nearly
  committed suicide at several points. It's only now that I can
  bring myself to review this man's book, patriot that he is. I say
  this so you know what you're getting yourself into. There are no
  flags, no stars and stripes, no fireworks, no sound effects. I
  have since recovered, but only because of old stars and stripes.
  I went back to teaching last year, not fully recovered, and my
  colleagues, knowing how much I love America and the STARS AND
  STRIPES, suggested I have my class do a research project: find
  the most patriotic book ever made. The methodoloy was simple: A
  book made out of flags with flag pictures would score high, a
  book that was not made out of a flag or flags and had no pictures
  of flags would score the lowest. We found some very good books
  and they did cheer me up. The one that was the most patriotic by
  far was a book called "President Jesus: How Jesus Wrote the
  Constitution, Freed the Slaves, and Won World War II." Its
  published by a small church in Texas. I was very proud of my
  students for finding it. It has brought countless joy to my life.
  Along with the book, made entirely out of a flag, with flag
  pictures, and written in blue and red ink, you get a giant flag.
  I'm not sure of the dimensions, but they had to haul it to my
  house in a moving truck. I've draped it over my house and it
  covers it completely. People even have to crawl under the flag to
  enter the house. Now I often go outside and just gaze at old
  stars and stripes for hours at a time, smiling.</Text>

  <Text category="music">I was very excited to hear that this new
  Muppets Holiday offering was coming! The previous two Christmas
  albums ("A Christmas Together" w/ John Denver &amp;amp; "A Muppet

  in December. However, this time I am disappointed. Most of the
  songs performed on this cd include voices not done by the
  original puppeteers that made them famous. I realize it is
  impossible to perfectly duplicate the voices to match the
  puppeteers that are no longer with us. But, to focus on these
  voices so much (Kermit, Rowlf, Dr. Teeth, Statler &amp;amp;
  Waldorf, The Swedish Chef) in this album, only produces a
  disappointing reminder that the "Muppets" we grew up with are
  long gone. Maybe I am being a little hard on this cd. But, there
  are plenty of Muppets they could have focused on for this project
  that are still performed in the original voices (Robin, Sam,
  Honeydew &amp;amp; Beaker, Rizzo, Louzeland, etc). Those voices
  added to those of Ganzo, Miss Piggy and Fozzie would have made
  for a more familiar feel. There are a couple of good cuts on the
  album. One is "Merry Christmas" by Pepe. The other is "Santa
  Baby" by Miss Piggy. Sadly, over all I can not recommend this

  <Text category="book">I love how many people like to say that
  Lawrence Walsh was a Republican. Funny. He was an Eisenhower
  Republican WORLDS REMOVED from the conservative movement. And
  let's face it: he stink bombed George H.W. Bush at the end of the
  1992 campaign when Bush was gaining ground on Clinton. I'm not
  saying Bush would have won if Walsh hadn't indicted Caspar
  Weinberger on the Friday before the election, but Walsh made a
  next-to-impossible task unattainable for Bush. Bush got him back,
  of course, by pardoning Weinberger on Christmas Eve, 1992. The
  beginning of the book was interesting to say the least. As it
  wore on, however, it became a prosecutor hoping to go down in
  history whining about Republicans. Let's face it: people in power
  tend to be corrupt. They have protection the rest of us don't
  have. This wasn't just true about Reagan and Bush; it's true
  about Clinton and whoever you wish to name. About halfway through
  the book, Walsh concentrates his fire on the guy who was VP at
  the time, GHW Bush. I also find the fact it was endorsed by a
  number of liberals interesting to say the least. I guess when you
  can't beat a guy at the ballot box, you impeach him or at least
  try to. Right? Not worth the investment of time or money - but
  does have some good historical information inside.</Text>

  an allergic reaction. March 23, 2007, Update: After the swelling
  on my face went down, my whole body started itching, and I had to
  go see two different doctors. The internist said that it got into
  my system, and gave me two strong prescriptions to get it out of
  my system. I took the medication for over 2 weeks, and used
  Cortizone 10 several times a day to relieve the itching. My arms

  stereotypical Doom sound, with the only standout being
  '1,2...1,2.' The X-ray produced tracks are minimal, but generally
  sound stiff, lacking much of a groove - thin synth lines, few
  sampled melodies. I did like 'Warning (Kong),' which has a nice,
  minimal, dark groove. The lyrical flows have a classic New York
  sound, pretty good. Lyrical content is pretty bad, unless you

  well, with murders happening in an old factory by some mysterious
  monster (that you don't see at first). From there it goes
  downhill, it felt like a low-rent 'Pet Sematary'. I have never
  read the short story that this was based off of, but I'm sure
  that King made his scarier than this movie could ever be. The
  best acting in the movie comes from Brad Dourif, best known for

  End, ruminates about a simple question: How much money do you
  need to feel secure? The problem is that security comes in
  multiple forms: happiness, comfort, excess consumption, ego. And
  the accuracy and stability of those measures and outcomes is
  compounded by key assumptions about how long you will live and
  how healthy those years will be. Constructing a one-year budget
  is hard enough. Constructing a thirty-year budget is nearly
  impossible. Eisenberg doesn't help his case by the offbeat and
  idiosyncratic examples and profiles he chooses. Doctors,
  divorcees, `downshifters', and very little real data shed little
  light on the real issues. Maybe I knew too much going in. Maybe I
  expected too much from a few positive references from other
  sources. In the middle I was confused. By the end I was simply
  disappointed. And I have my own number, and it changes every
  day</Text>

  <Text category="book">If you have had any exposure to good
  literature, you will find this novel nearly insufferable. The
  symbolism is cliche, narrative style predictable and unoriginal,
  and the book as a whole is this woman's self-indulgent notion
  that the story of her family makes a good read. If she had any
  creative ability, she could use her family history as a starting
  point, but she does very little to distinguish her writing as
  exciting and fresh. Dull, dry, predicatable, callow, and
  unfortuantly a requirement from a lit professor who has insulted
  my eight semesters as an English student</Text>
  <Text category="book">I know that no book can cover every topic, but
  this book left a lot out. It went into great detail about what I
  should do if I got some pretty rare diseases, but barely touched
  on the subject of Morning sickness, which is much more common.
  And some of the information was just plain wrong. I trashed the
  book when it made me freak out in the 20th week because I
  couldn't feel the baby move. It advised that I should call the
  doctor. When I did, I found out most women don't feel it move
  until 21 weeks. Unfortunately I found this out after I had cried
  my eyes out thinking something was wrong. I would not suggest
  this book to anyone</Text>

  <Text category="book">The book I am going to talk about is the book
  Arms and the Man By Bernard Shaw. I really did not like this book
  because it was hard for me to understand. The reason I didn't
  like it was because it was challenging for me. The English was
  hard to understand. I liked how the writer wrote the book and I
  would probably look for another one of his books. This book was
  more like an opera with out music. If I could have and known to I
  probably would not have this enthusiastic about the book. One
  reason I picked the book was because it was dealing with war and
  I thought it would have been cool to read about war, but when I
  got more in to the book it was really not about war it was more
  about a love at war. If you're an older audience it would be a
  good book, or if you're looking for a good love-war story.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">If it were up to my children, they would rate
  this stuff 5+ stars. They love it and they are totally
  entertained with it. It is one of the only times they play
  quietly without fighting. Mom, on the other hand, hates it and
  you know it is bad when a toy gives mom some free time of peace
  and quiet and she wants no part of it!!! This stuff sticks to
  everything and anything-including your children. You can't
  believe the mess it makes. Imagine billions of tiny little balls
  stuck to everything in your house. I confine it to their
  playroom, but it follows them everywhere they go. You will find
  it all over your house and in everything-you can't escape it. As
  for the product itself, it definitely doesn't dry out, but it
  also doesn't hold together as well as described making it quite
  difficult to make the objects it claims you can make on the
  package. Once you put colors together it is impossible to
  separate them out as they are tiny millimeter balls. Playdooh may
  dry out if left out, but it doesn't make anywhere near the mess
  this stuff does and it also molds much better than playfoam! My
  advice is to stick with your playdooh</Text>

  <Text category="toys_games">My daughter, 6, received this for Christmas.
  Her 4-year-old brother also wanted to play with it. The first
  problem is that there are NO INSTRUCTIONS included for how to put
  it together. This is a problem when you have two antsy kids eager
  to play with it. I was struggling with getting the various panels
  to snap together solidly when, after repeated attempts, I
  happened to look in the drawer underneath the colored bulbs and
  crayons, and found -- what do you know! -- screws. Then, after I
  put on the top, I realized I should have installed the light bulb
  first (you need a light bulb of 25 watts or less, not included).
  Then, when I thought I was done, I found I had a piece left over.
  Arrgh! That extra piece was a clip that is supposed to hold a
  picture for tracing. Ha! Even after I installed it, there's no
  tension on the clip and very little chance that it will hold
  anything. There are two drawers to hold the bulbs and crayons.
  Good idea. But for some reason the drawers catch and stick. How
  hard can it be to make drawers that slide easily in and
  out?</Text>
  <Text category="book">I have a hard time understanding what it is
  that I dislike about the novel. I dislike it almost as much as
  the movie. I have been a loyal follower of Smiley and some more
  after that. Once the Cold War was over, JlC had to look for a new
  realm. I tried to follow him, but gave up with the Kaukasian
  troubles, forgot the name of the book. Maybe it is this: JlC's
  trade mark, his USP, is the evilness of the other side. With the
  KGB &amp;amp; Co., that worked perfectly. His readers were
  willing to stay with him and believe him. Now he is transferring
  the KGB style to all sorts of other badies. I think it does not
  work any more. It is not that I trust the pharmaceutical
  companies enough to not be like here insinuated. I do not. What I
  do not like, I guess, is the artificial mood of intellectual
  suffering from the evilness of all kind of conspiracies. Tess in
  this story seems to be the normal do-gooder who falls foul with
  the baddies. That is more ok in the book than in the movie.
  (There, for my eyes, Rachel Weisz does herself discredit.) What
  is absolutely not ok is the surrender of command by the narrator
  mid way. JlC gives up on trying to keep a believable storyline
  and declines into darkest conspiracy allegations</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">The go-cart is much smaller that it appeared

  awful that I don't know how anybody can listen to it. Thankfully
  they got smart and went back to the original for Rancho Texicano.

  carry it to the beach to use it. I actually called the
  Manufacturer (they provided a toll free number) several times.
  Never did they answer the phone, nor did they ever return any of
  my calls. So I could not find out if they thought it was aluminum
  or not. The lounger itself seemed pretty nice, just too heavy and
  probably would rust soon</Text>
  <Text category="book">The plot of this book was interesting, and it
  could have been a good book. Unfortunately, it wasn't. The main
  problem for me was that the hero is dispicable, and the heroine
  has absolutely no self esteem! Even many of the the secondary
  characters are weak, miserable people! The story starts when the
  hero finds himself drawn to the heroine even though he considers
  her a "dirty little nobody". Once she gets a makeover and is
  actually beautiful, he begins pressuring her to become his
  mistress even though she is an innocent marriageable female by
  regency standards. Because she is the daughter of a "cit", he
  can't imagine why she has any reservations about the deal. He
  says charming things to her like "how much do you think your
  virginity is worth anyway". Now that's romance! Meanwhile, even
  though she is unbelievably insulted by the hero many times, she
  finds herself drawn to him too. For me their relationship was
  sort of like an abuser and his victim. She never stood up for
  herself, and you felt sorry for her. Of course the plot twist
  involves a mystery about her parentage... only its not really a
  mystery because almost everyone knows the hero is a Dukes
  granddaughter, including her. In fact just about the only one who
  doesn't know is the hero, which provides the dilemma. He would of
  course be willing to marry her if only he knew she really wasn't
  a nobody! Will anyone tell him? Will he wise up and offer to
  marry her even though she isn't good enough for him? Will she
  give in to her desires and become his mistress since he doesn't
  think she is good enough for him to marry? Of course it all works
  out, and he actually proposes to before he finds out she actually
  is good enough for him. Ugh!!! This could have been a good book
  if the "mystery" had been handled better, and the characters were
  written differently. As is, it is a sad regency tale</Text>

  <Text category="book">I have an Amazon bookmark that advertises
  Ludlum's book "The Sigma Protocol". It says "In Ludlum's latest,
  an ordinary man battles a global conspiracy." Well gee. That's
  the plot of THIS book as well. Come to think of it, that's the
  plot of every book by the man that I've read. A 'vast right wing
  conspiracy' is set to take over the world. They have small
  armies, a lot of money and a plan. This time around, a group of
  military men (naturally) plan to foment terror, and use the chaos
  to implement their vision of the world (laugh not - millions in
  the Middle East and far Left believe 9-11 was something along the
  same lines). Enter "ordinary man" Joel Converse. He's a Vietnam
  vet and P.O,W. who thought he had left that life far behind. It's
  up to him to save the world. He will survive certain death
  several times (the bad guys always seem to think they need him
  alive, and they just HAVE to explain their conspiracy to this
  total stranger). He will find love, and he'll visit several
  European cities to boot. Of course, a suspension of disbelief is
  essential for many novels (how else would you believe that a Nazi
  and an Israeli are on the same side?), but Ludlum's cliched
  stories are further worsened by the fact that he just couldn't
  write. His dialogue writing is always tedious, and sometimes just
  painful to read. Action scenes are generic. The only thing he
  could do right is character background, but that's not enough to
  save this. "The Aquitaine Progression" might make a half decent
  TV movie, but to endure 700 pages is just too much</Text>

  past her bedtime. (It's past "Late Night Willie's" bedtime too, I
  hate to tell you.) Heck, I've heard high school jazz bands cook
  twice as hot as this "Keith and the Somnambulists" incarnation.
  Garbarek sounds like he's going to give himself a hernia trying
  to get out the altissimos. I can't think of one interesting drum
  riff in the whole 61 minutes plus. (Neither can Christensen.) Les
  Scandinavianes sound like they need about 10 hours sleep and
  then, maybe, they start thinking about picking up musical
  instruments. Jarrett is as wired as ever, but even he can't keep
  up with some of the tempos and the overall mood is disoriented,
  forced and cumbersome. How any reviewer can say that this release
  captures the quartet's tight integration, displayed amazingly
  well elsewhere, is beyond me. With the exception of "Innocence,"
  none of the compositions are very good, either. "Oasis" has an
  interesting, if dire, melody line, but it can't summon the
  required ambience because of all of the clutter and dog poop
  around it. Unlike the other three releases mentioned above, this
  one has very little magnetism - the first track is all rambling
  rose jazz, where none of the musicians are feeding off each
  other. I don't enjoy this kind of jazz, so cliched and
  unintegrated. It contains that Jarrettian need to rush things and
  gang jump the tempo with heavy-handed neurosis peddled as jazz
  fusion. You feel like some nut in a BMW is suddenly sitting 10
  inches off your bumper, too demented to use the passing lane.
  (Yes, I know Keith has mastered his scales and likes to crack
  knuckles with tempos and, yes, I now have a headache.) There is
  an interesting part at the end, however, where Garbarek cuts way
  back on the throttle and swaggers around in the lower and upper
  registers of his tenor sax in some nice ways. But the transition
  is contrived at best and bears no organic relation to the first
  part. Only "Innocence" benefits from the fact that these guys are
  probably taking a red eye flight to New York soon. It is a
  beautiful lullabye, arguably Jarrett's best composition. True,
  the "Nude Ants" version is all you need really, but something
  happens on this version of the song that is very special. Jarrett
  puts in one of his best, if not his best, jazz piano
  performances. The composition is perfectly suited to his
  virtuosity and sensitivities and the somnambulists, who are still
  pulling a Code 9, can't screw it up even if they want to. (There
  is a halo around Keith Jarrett's head I bet you.) Garbarek
  (somnambulist #1) plays the melody with a lot of heart, but he
  screws up the tempo in a very brief, weak improvisation. The man
  is tapped, knows it and decides it's time to end the song. Palle
  Danielsson (somnambulist #2) misses a lot of notes (doubly bad on
  double bass) and goes off into an ill-conceived, top-heavy
  improvisation right at the beginning of the song. Like Garbarek,
  he knows enough to STOP and retreat, letting Jarrett take over. I
  can't remember a dang thing about somnambulist #3 (Christensen).
  But Jarrett's effort cannot be touched and he plays like a true
  wizard. A week later at the Village Vangard ("Nude Ants"),
  they'll all be playing at this level. If anything, I'd like to
  see the PM version of "Innocence" included in a compilation of
  the best concert performances by this quartet rather than a whole
  release of this mediocre concert. For the most part here, we get
  hum-drum mountains, where many of the great riffs from the
  releases mentioned above are handled like a shaky old butler
  serving up tea, with people getting burned and tablecloths
  getting ruined. In particular, Garbarek's performance on "Nude
  Ants" is far superior to this one and maybe the mean streets of
  Greenwich Village got his "Norwegian up." Maybe they weren't so
  sure if they were going to make it back to the hotel alive - New
  York USED to be like this you know - and, well, it just might be
  your last gig. On "Personal Mountains," it's all polite "thank
  yous" and Japanese clapping robotically. Not a tinkling glass of
  booze in the whole schmooze. Not even a bonze meditating for
  more. But, that Manfred Eicher, such a card, I tell you.</Text>
  <Text category="book">The literature of September 11 is never
  attacked. When a book speaks of September 11 (or of terrorism in
  general), it is more or less guaranteed immunity from criticism;
  it will almost inescapably be greeted with sympathy. Jonathan
  Safran Foer's EXTREMELY LOUD AND INCREDIBLY CLOSE banks on such
  sympathy, on such reverence. The narrative, which concerns a
  nine-year-old boy named Oskar Schell in search of a key that
  would unlock / unshell the enigma of his dead father (a narrative
  stolen, in its basic outline, from Guenther Grass's DIE
  BLECHTROMMEL), could have been written entirely without its
  scattered references to the terrorist interventions. Nor is this
  trauma the only one presented in the novel: the others include
  Hiroshima / Nagasaki, the Staten Island Ferry crash, and the
  Dresden bombings. Each disaster is generalized to the point at
  which what is addressed is not a traumatizing event in its
  specificity, but historical "trauma" itself and the overcoming of
  trauma through bereavement-inspired creation. Oskar, the
  insufferable brat, attempts to complete the work of mourning for
  his father, Thomas Schell, Jr., a victim of September 11, by
  compiling an almanac of self-inflicted wounds, the collage of
  images and letters which is the book we are "reading"---an
  almanac which, most likely, is written sometime in the indefinite
  future (Thomas Shell, Sr.'s manuscript of 4/12/78 is heavily
  edited (pp. 208-216). Who has done the editing? Almost certainly
  an older version of his grandson Oskar). If the term, "reading"
  even applies. Whenever a "pregnant" image is described, Foer
  literally re-presents it in the form of a pictorial image. When a
  flock of birds rises into the sky, it is not enough that we read
  of these birds---we must see them as well. Words may not be left
  in their invisibility; we are presented with supplementary
  photographs, illustrations, since mere verbality is not enough.
  (Indeed, the entire novel oozes with misologos --- the mistrust
  or hatred of language --- in terms of both its content and its
  form.) Photographs, yes, and also a superabundance of blank pages
  and nearly blank pages. Space is not used in the manner it is in
  the works of Edmond Jabes, for instance. Typography does not
  substitute for a well-wrought sentence. Foer abrogates himself of
  all responsibilities --- most specifically, the responsibility to
  write well. Why bother when the pyrotechnics of typography are at
  his disposal? As far as the writing is concerned, it is composed
  of nothing other than mind-numbingly, soul-deadeningly repetitive
  phrases ("heavy boots," "raison d'etre," etc.) and Sunday school
  platitudes: "Sometimes one simply wants to disappear" (184);
  "There's nothing wrong with not understanding yourself" (184);
  "Everything that's born has to die, which means our lives are
  like skyscrapers" (245); "How can you say I love you to someone
  you love?... It's always necessary" (314). Whenever the author
  writes something that he finds "beautiful" and "true" (165), he
  congratulates himself on his brilliance and tells us that that
  thing is "beautiful" and "true." The entire book reeks of such
  unearned profundity. We also learn that most dust is made up of
  human detritus---a very deep truth indeed, one that Foer also
  communicates in his essay, "Emptiness" (originally published in
  PLAYBOY) with all of the sanctimoniousness and self-righteousness
  of the faux naif who serves as the center of the novel, a Sunday
  school lecture in which we learn that famous musicians (Ringo
  Star) and scientists (Stephen Hawking) are unthreateningly
  approachable: everything is familiarized. Perhaps it is wrong to
  criticize Foer for including so many blank pages in EXTREMELY
  LOUD AND INCREDIBLY CLOSE, since the entire book is a vacuum:
  null space into which readers may project their own meanings.

  had it for about 5 hours now and is already tired of it. We've
  tried no less that 20 different cars and have yet been able to
  get it to work. The only thing it seems to do consistently is
  play that obnoxious sound over and over again (if you know how to

  <Text category="book">Written in cartoon format, I thought this book
  would be a lighter approach to a straight, dry, biography of

  political cartoons than cartoons for kids. The cartoons are
  barely understandable if the biography of the scientist is not
  already known, so using it as an initial reading is impossible.
  Further, some content is offensive. On the second page of
  cartoons, a scientist is walking along a bridge, thinking, when
  someone mistakenly believes he is getting ready to jump, saying,
  "No woman is worth committing suicide over." The pictures show a
  scantily-clad woman (with bare bottom in one frame) that he is

  <Text category="music">The versions of "Black Sabbath" and "War Pigs"
  actually comprise half of Black Sabbath's appearance on the April
  26, 1970 edition of John Peel's 'Sunday Show.' "Black Sabbath"
  features a unique third verse that appears on no other officially
  released version of the song. "War Pigs" is actually "Walpurgis,"
  an earlier incarnation of the song featuring entirely different
  lyrics. Incidentally, the other two songs from that broadcast,
  "Fairies Wear Boots" and "Behind the Wall of Sleep," were
  released as bonus tracks on the supplemental disc issued with the
  first pressings of the original 1997 release. All four of these
  tracks, while fascinating, don't rightfully belong on this
  collection, as this disc intends to highlight Ozzy Osbourne's
  career as a solo artist. For that reason, the live version of
  "Paranoid" that appears on this set is equally unnecessary. Those
  songs are frustrating inclusions on an Ozzy Osbourne greatest
  hits album, particularly since they come at the apparent
  exclusion of some of Ozzy's biggest hits and/or notable tracks
  such as "Flying High Again," "Shot in the Dark," "I Don't Know,"
  "Breaking All the Rules," or "Road to Nowhere." To add to the
  confusion, some of the solo-era material included here isn't
  exactly what it purports to be. Ozzy has been the subject of a
  number of recent legal disputes over writing and performance
  royalties. These disputes ostensibly prompted Ozzy to reissue his
  back catalog in 2002 with, in some cases, re-recorded tracks. The
  'Blizzard of Ozz' and 'Diary of a Madman' albums now feature
  pointlessly re-recorded rhythm parts, presumably as a snub to the
  original rhythm section of Lee Kerslacke (drums) and Bob Daisley
  (bass), who, incidentally, wrote the lyrics to almost every Ozzy
  solo track from 'Blizzard of Ozz' through 'No More Tears.' The
  'Bark at the Moon' album, while not re-recorded, was most
  certainly remixed. It is the re-recorded versions of the
  'Blizzard of Ozz' and 'Diary of a Madman' tracks and the remixed
  version of the 'Bark at the Moon' track that appear on the
  current edition of this collection. Finally, the version of "No
  More Tears" is actually the video edit, not the album version. In
  addition, due to one of the disputes mentioned above, 'The
  Ultimate Sin' album was not selected for remastering in 2002 and
  has subsequently been dropped from Ozzy's catalog. That album's
  biggest hit, "Shot in the Dark," which appeared on the original
  1997 release of this collection, has now been replaced with
  "Miracle Man" from 'No Rest for the Wicked.' Along these lines,
  the 'Just Say Ozzy' live EP and the double-disc live album, 'Live
  and Loud,' both of which contain a live version of "Shot in the
  Dark," have also been deleted from Ozzy's catalog. Not even 'The
  Essential Ozzy Osbourne,' a double-disc collection covering
  Ozzy's entire solo career, features a single song from 'The
  Ultimate Sin.' The ultimate sin, indeed. My recommendation is to
  avoid this collection (and the 2002 remasters) and instead search
  for the 1995 remasters or, better yet, search for the original
  albums on vinyl</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">As a fan of zombie movies and as someone who
  enjoyed City of the Living Dead and Zombie, I was very
  disappointed with House by the Cemetery. Fulci manages to create
  a good mystery in the first two-thirds of the movie, only to
  squander it on some poorly executed scare scenes. House By the
  Cemetery is about an researcher (whose work is never specified)
  who moves his wife and his kid into a house in Massachussets in
  order to finish out the work of a colleague who killed himself
  and his mistress. The titular house is the only place they can
  really find for the moment, so Dr. Boyle, his wife Lucy and their
  son Bob move in despite a lot of bad signs, like the boarded-up
  door to the cellar and a tombstone for a Dr. Jacob Tess
  Freudstein in the front hall. Bob has little red-headed girl for
  a friend who keeps warning him about how bad the house is (though
  no one else sees her). Furthermore, people keep claiming Dr.
  Boyle has been in town before with a non-existent daughter (which
  he denies, not totally convincingly). He also seems to have some
  secret relationship with the babysitter, Anne, who starts
  unboarding the cellar door in the middle of the night. And Lucy
  seems to either be recovering from or suffering from serious
  psychological issues. Got that? Good, because half of that stuff
  never gets explained. The only things that get worked out are the
  little red-headed girl's identity and the identity of the killer
  (neither of which are that hard to figure out). There are some
  nice visual moments in the earlier parts of the film (the fact
  that the killer has one normal hand and one rotting hand, the
  photograph that changes with each viewing, a mannequin that gets
  beheaded and starts bleeding) but Fulci's ability to handle the
  gore moments disappoints. He lingers too long over some deaths,
  makes the killer so ridiculously slow that a snail could outrun
  him and bits like the babysitter's head falling down the stairs
  come off as funny rather than scary. Compared to the injury to
  the eye scene in Zombie or Christopher George chopping through
  the coffin in CotLD, Dr. Boyle's chopping through the door around
  his son's head feels like self-parody. Fulci's other films have
  incoherent plots , but rarely in a way that seems to work against
  the plot (the dream-like nature of City of the Living Dead seems
  appropriate given the prophetic dream the heroine gets and the
  mystical nature of the threat) and the execution of the setpieces
  is usually fantastic. House by the Cemetery has neither thing
  working in its favor. It's not Hell of the Living Dead-level bad,
  but the fact that it has some genuinely good acting (especially
  Paolo Malco, who plays Dr. Boyle) and an interesting set-up
  almost make the flaws worse. Also, this version has a "never
  before seen deleted scene", but it has no sound and is just an
  extended reaction shot after the bat attack</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I hate lawyers. What is a lawyer, anyway?
  Basically: it's a telemarketer in a decent suit, a guy who would
  be hawking the latest Ronco Hair-in-a-Can super-duper late night
  special to folks in Akron over his plantronic headset, only he
  won the genetic lottery and got shot out of an upper-middle class
  womb. Shakespeare said it first and best: "First, let's kill all
  the lawyers!". Former Enron uber-dealmaker John Wing put a little
  fast-times Houston spin on that one: "get all the lawyers in a
  room---and shoot 'em!---in the mouth, so you *can't* miss!"
  Exactly. Anyway, "The Firm" is a flick that purports to make the
  world of high-priced yappers jaw-rippingly exciting, so I was
  probably all amped up to despise it. But not really: back before
  I dug into a gig with the Dark Side in high finance, back when I
  was hefting a backpack over the sodden campus of my old alma
  mater, I briefly considered going into law: briefly, for about an
  hour. It was a desperate time, and I needed money. Why did I
  consider walking Hell's Highway, if only for an instant? Because
  John Grisham, boring
  lawyer-turned-ripping-potboiler-writer-turned-back-into-boring-lawyer,
  a kind of Tom Clancy for the paper-pusher and green-eyeshade set,
  made it all sound pretty damned funky (and lucrative! Hey, dig
  that BMW 7 series, baby, beep beep!) in his engrossing little
  novel "The Firm": granted, I've read better prose on the backs of
  cereal boxes, but it held my attention. I mean, seriously: you're
  19, and the whole flying out on the corporate Lear to Grand
  Cayman and switching out briefcases full of cash sounds kinda
  cool. And strippers, man, plenty of strippers. Oh, and did
  someone mention a BMW? What's the difference between a lawyer and
  a snake? The snake at least has the decency to hiss before it
  sinks its fangs into your a**. Now it's true: Grisham writes like
  Kim Jong Il sings, but---in "The Firm", anyway---he was a master
  craftsman at moving things along at a bristling pace, from the
  pedestrian---hotshot Law School whiz kid gets picked up by a
  Memphis white-shoe law firm---to the Pretty Damned Atrocious, all
  while keeping the pressure ratcheted up with a dense, suffocating
  sense of malice. Grisham, like Michael Crichton, isn't a prose
  genius: he's not even mediocre. But he writes for film, and "The
  Firm" cried out for cinematic treatment. So it's baffling that,
  with all the right Stuff---Tom Cruise as winsome lead Mitch
  McDeere, Gene Hackman doing his chain-drinking Gene Hackman thang
  as the corrupt (but ultimately worn-out and pathetic) senior
  partner, and Sydney Pollack helming it up---that the big-screen
  treatment of "The Firm" is such a yawner. Talk about contempt of
  court. Pollack takes all that intricately woven little
  Grisham-plot and barfs big ugly chunks of it up on the screen. At
  its guts, really, "The Firm" was really nothing more than the Big
  Career Nightmare: I've bet the farm on this gig, I'm getting big
  money, I'm working like a fiend, my wife is having trouble
  remembering my name, and evidently I'm not doing tax-deals for
  loaded clients---I'm doing money laundering for The Mob. Pollack
  just mangles the whole thing, convolutes the simple, and renders
  up a flick that will have you checking your watch and yawning.
  Casting is part of the problem: Cruise does his thing, running
  around Memphis with his briefcase. Hackman drinks a lot and
  exudes pure Armani-clad sleaze: "The Firm" is all funny-wrinkles
  when he's onscreen, but hey, a man can only do so much. Jeanne
  Tripplehorn (Cruise's squeeze), who plays Lara San Giacomo when
  she's not playing Tripplehorn (seriously, google the two of 'em:
  astounding!) is a bitter old battleaxe who made me want to stick
  forks in my eyes. Wilford Brimley is just plain wrong as The
  Firm's security chief: too bald, too cracker, too rotund, too
  silly, too low-end, to do the role justice. Holly Hunter is even
  worse: Hunter is one of those eighties thangs who got pumped up
  as Something Sexy, which is baffling, given that she's about 3'8,
  and has all the sex appeal of an Oompah-Loompah. It doesn't help
  that she's a big, ugly Southern stereotype, the caricature most
  denizens of dumpy Michigan towns imagine Southerners to be. You
  want her to die: she doesn't. Pollack wants us to think she's
  clever and funny. She isn't. Ed Harris, I think, is in this
  movie. So is Hal Holbrook, which kinda ruins everything, because
  everytime Hal Holbrook is in a movie you know you're dealing with
  a bunch of friggin' crooks. Anyway, the coup de grace to the
  stupidity is the entrance, Deus Ex Machina, of Paul Sorvino (Don
  Morolto---what kind of Goombah name is dat, anyway? Somebody call
  Tony Soprano!), who takes this juggernaut of boredom from the
  merely stupid to the totally ridiculous. If you wanna see Tom
  Cruise running around Memphis with his briefcase for two hours,
  by all means belly up to the bar. Otherwise, case dismissed.

  <Text category="book">I read this book after watching the brilliant
  movie version of "The Hours." If that's your motivation, don't
  waste your time. My English teachers will cringe when I say it,
  but this book, well, sucks. It may well be great literature, but
  the characters are not engaging, and if it was Woolf's motive to
  out-do James Joyce in chronicling a day-in-the-life and in
  writing a stream of conscious narrative, she doesn't pull it off.
  Again, the characters and the internal mental life simply don't
  have the power that "Ulysses" has. Reading Woolf is necessary for
  a good eduction. I recommend, however, that you read "To the
  Lighthouse". I may still be motivated to read the book version of

  <Text category="music">I'm a big fan of "The Boss", but for the life

  new material that can't be found elsewhere, and is basically
  nothing more than a "live in concert" CD that just so happened to
  be filmed by MTV. This concert took place in 1992, and you know
  it's pretty bad when you have bands ribbing you three years later
  about going on MTV UNPlugged, and then having to go and plug in.
  It's not like Bruce doesn't know how to play acoustic guitar,
  because he does. I'm a big acoustic guitar fan, and for someone
  of Bruce's talent level, to not be able to write songs that can
  be played acoustically only serves to bring down the level of
  respect I have for his talent. Not what I would consider an
  essential recording, and not recommended, unless you are such a
  die-hard "Boss" fan that you have to own every album he puts out.

  guy to pull off wearing the stuff. The smell really draws
  attention to a guy so he better keep his body hard and fit if he
  wants that type of attention, otherwise he'll just be annoying.
  Old Spice Cologne actually smells better if you let it age in the
  bottle for a long time; exposing it to heat helps to age it
  (leave a bottle in the car or attic in the summertime or outside
  in your tool building). Trust me, it smells awesome if you let it
  age. I meant to rate this a five star but hit the wrong toggle.
  I'm proud to say I'm carrying on the tradition of wearing Old
  Spice cologne. It's not nerdy and it's not just for older men.
  It's a cologne for any masculine guy. It smells great</Text>
  <Text category="music">Presumably the label is trying to cater to
  mid-range fans who have a Prince album or two but don't want to
  buy them all and who want more than a single disc hits
  collection. The way this is laid out though is confusing at best:
  Disc 1 seems to be for the mid-range fan and it makes sense that
  they would choose the single edits though some of those chosen
  are questionable. ("My Name is Prince"? His take on "Nothing
  Compares 2 U" when Sinead O'Connor's is definitive?) Disc 2
  compiles 12" mixes and remixes and similar rarities..i.e. for the
  diehard only who has to have every little bleat His Purpleness
  every records. BOTTOM LINE: This is haphazardly thrown together.
  Middle range fans are better off with THE HITS/THE B-SIDES which
  compiles his biggest chart stuff with a pretty decent selection
  of interesting flip side material (some of which equals his
  singles)</Text>
  <Text category="health">I really like the size of this pitcher but
  there is one thing that I'm not too happy about. The filter
  doesn't "lock" down into the top and when you tip the pitcher
  over to pour the water out, the filter plops out of the top,
  causing the whole top to fall out of the pitcher. It's very
  aggravating and just about makes it more trouble than it's worth.
  The other Brita pitcher I have, the filter locks into place and
  doesn't do this.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">First of all, yes, this film was made in
  Vancouver, with only a few shots of the Manhattan skyline. When
  Golden Harvest was making this film, they had to try their best
  to shoot at angles that didn't show any mountains, and they had
  to paint grafitti each day and unpaint it each night. Then Jackie
  Chan told them to simply forget all of that and focus on the
  action. Well, action was what they focused on the most indeed. It
  sure is funny to see how the Chinese thought of the United States
  at this time, because what you see in this film are hippies that
  drive around in trucks full of beach balls. You also get
  multi-ethnic gangs trashing places (seriously, the gang has a
  Native American with pigtails and a frayed jacket! That's almost
  offensive). You have fat cops that just sit around smoking
  cigars. You have random, small-crowd rock concerts where everyone
  is dressed up in animal suits! Bizarre indeed. As for the
  actions, this film has some of his best. The first fight scene in
  the grocery store is supurb, and graceful, using his jacket to
  dispatch enemies, and endlessly hitting the same guy in the nose
  over and over. He takes on the entire gang in a back alley before
  getting cornered, very impressive. This leads to a scene where
  he's being chased around the streets of New York, where the
  entire gang, on motor cycles, try to run him over, and Jackie
  must rely on his ability to run like the wind and climb like a
  monkey. He also does a dangerous stunt where he jumps from the
  roof of a parking garage onto a fire escape of another building.
  No harness or wiresupport! The fight scene at the gang's hideout
  is also one his best, using whatever object he can get his hands
  ont, and very acrobatic. Also, Jackie Chan has to cling to a
  hovercraft while it drives on water and land! Some of this was
  done on a broken ankle! If this DVD was uncut and undubbed, and
  had the original score, I'd give it a total of three stars.
  Unfortunately, for a so-so film, New Line makes it worse. Some of
  the dubbing is very bad. It seems as if New Line dubbed some of
  the original English dialouge also. Only very, very little of the
  original Cantonese dialouge is there. Also, the film's original
  score has been redone to a more orchestrated score with slight
  rock. Many, many scenes were cut from the original movie. Not
  only that, but some of the action scenes were cut too. Try and
  find an uncut version out there. This DVD you should stay away
  from</Text>

  with the help of my trainer who is skilled at using calipers it
  gave widely variable readings and inconsistant results. The
  feature that takes your % body fat and classifies your level by

  <Text category="book">I wanted to like this book... I enjoyed the
  first two in the series. But this one left me a bit dry...
  Babylon Rising: The Europa Conspiracy by Tim Lahaye and Bob
  Phillips. This continues the story of Michael Murphy, a college
  professor teaching biblical archaeology. He is now heading off to
  Iraq to follow a tip on the location of "The Handwriting on the
  Wall" from the days of Daniel. He's falling in love with a
  colleague who is in the same area, and he fears for her safety as
  things start to get dicey in his life. Talon and the mysterious
  Seven are trying to eliminate him, and there are a few attempts
  on his life. Mixed into this story is a terrorist attack on New
  York designed to throw America into an economic and national
  panic, as well as to prompt the UN to move their headquarters to
  the ancient city of Babylon. Murphy, for someone who's pretty
  much a small fish in the large ocean, finds himself in the middle
  of all this... As I said, I really wanted to like this book. The
  Murphy character is likeable, and I enjoyed the action. But the
  plotline was spotty and over the top. Murphy was using martial
  arts to take out everyone who attacked him (highly unlikely).
  Everything the terrorists tried to do was thwarted just in the
  nick of time (over the top). The story attempted to be both a
  Christian End Times novel and a terrorist suspense novel, and
  they didn't do either one especially well. Murphy's growing
  infatuation with Isis was rather repetitive with the "she's so
  beautiful" and "could she be interested in me" interludes. And
  finally, none of the plotlines wrapped up. You got to the end and
  thought "so?" Fine if you're ready to read the next installment,
  but not good if you started here or you have to wait some months
  for the next one... Part of me wants to be nice, give the book
  the benefit of the doubt, and rate it a "3". But the authors are
  better than this, and I've come to expect more from someone who's
  been doing this for a long time... If you're committed to the
  series, you'll want/have/need to read it, but just don't come in
  with your expectations very high..</Text>

  one. Perhaps if I had more interest in the fashion industry, I'd
  have been more fascinated by the inside look that "Devil"
  provides. Meryl Streep is very good as the apparently soulless

  <Text category="book">I was intrigued by the title, which supposedly
  links Jedi wisdom to Christianity. Well, after 60 pages or so, I
  have got the feeling that the Staub is trying to wrap Jedi in
  Christian cloth and failing at that. The author speaks of the
  difficulty in leading a Christian life. But, I say that any
  religious life (be it Christian, Islam or otherwise) is hard
  because it turns the back on the norm or the conventional. I am
  convinced that Yoda is a Zen master; the Force is derived from
  Tao, not God as interpreted by the orthodox religion(I am
  purposefully leaving out Christian Mysticism, which is another
  beast altogether.). A better book on the subject of theology in
  Star wars is "The Dharma of Star Wars."</Text>
  <Text category="book">If you are a Christian, this book isn't for
  you. It is full of blashphemy, concluding that we must "...

  be God..." without our love for Him. At one point he reduces God
  to an aminal saying that in the garden of Eden, when God said
  "...let US make man in OUR image" he was speking to animals and
  creation. Kusher explains that God created the world, and in the
  next paragraph that we came by evolution. Since when was God in
  need of forgiveness? Isnt it that "... God so loved the world"
  and it wasnt us that loved God? I have no words in describing
  this book. It is full of error, because it does not base it self
  on the Gospel of Jesus Christ. All this book does is frees you
  from the thought that you are a sinner, and that it isnt your
  fault, and that actully you are a good person. Why do bad things
  happen to good people? Wrong question. There are no good people
  in the world in the first place. " for all have sinned and come
  short of the glory of God..." The world is in sin. The world DOES
  NOT HAVE GOOD PEOPLE!! Only by the grace of God, through faith in
  Jesus Christ you are made righteous. I beg you in the name of

  million people, but it lied to them. Kusher, please turn from

  <Text category="book">After reading the trilogy, I was left
  wondering what the hell happened? I have just read all 3 of the
  His Dark Materials trilogy and what was a strong start in book 1
  and 2 is utterly demolished in this clunker. Pullman allowed his
  eagerness to bash religion to completely destroy an engaging
  story - one of the most creative stories I've come across in 20
  years of reading fantasy. There isn't even a remote chance of a
  sequel to fix up this mess. If you look up `anticlimax' in the
  dictionary, you'll see a picture of this book. From first page to
  last, time is wasted on boring characters, while all the good
  ones are either killed off, or just MIA for the entire book.
  Spoilers ahead. What about Lyra and her parents? Somehow, she
  never knows what happened to them and after all she has been
  through is supposed to be content with going back to school like
  a good little girl? She never even confronts them to try and
  understand their motivations. And Will just goes back with Mary
  Malone to her apartment so they can figure out how to avoid the
  cops. Over a cup of tea, naturally. And that's it for him. In
  addition to all that, this book doesn't even seem to be connected
  to the first two. None of the characters resonate they way they
  used to and instead of being good friends, Will and Lyra fall in
  love and have sex at the tender age of 11 or 12 . . . all in the
  last 30 pages. What happened to the story, for cripes sake?! And
  what happened to the `temptation'? Was choosing not to stay with
  Will her way of not succumbing to it? The whole premise is just
  so lame to start out with. As an earlier reviewer pointed out all
  the windows that were opened for centuries didn't endanger the
  universe, why not leave one open for 60 or 70 years to give Lyra
  and Will a chance to know each other. The flimsy reasoning behind
  this is just as contrived as their sudden and immediate love for
  one another. Supposedly, they had more than gonads going for
  them, they survived death together! Pullman didn't feel like
  thinking it through, he just wanted a gut wrenching ending. In
  addition to that, he wanted to mock the reader by taunting us
  with the `reality' of knowing that nothing they did in the
  trilogy has any hope or meaning. All of Will and Lyra's efforts
  are futile, kind of like - guess what? religion for the rest of
  us morons. After having the reader go through endless pages on
  the mulefa-elephant aliens or whatever, ultimately the characters
  the reader wants to know about disappear with barely a whimper.
  Iorek Byrnison, Lee Scoresby - instead we get page after page
  about Mary Malone the Disaffected former Nun. Pullman all but
  pants in his eagerness to give the finger to anyone of us who
  believes in Him or anything for that matter! This is NOT
  children's literature, it's a hate ridden manifesto that is more
  suitable for adults who at least have some way of maintaining
  some sort of perspective throughout this sloppy mess. It's
  totally dishonest to sell this as a children's book, or even as a
  competent work of fiction. All of the painstaking work of the
  first two books is undone with this one. We never get closure on
  Lyra's parents. We never really understand what Dust is and where
  it comes from. We never see Will reunited with his mother. We get
  a lame battle where `god' dies and no one even knows why or how.
  Lyra and Will fall in love, but have to `sacrifice' it so that
  all the windows to other worlds can be shut forever, with only
  flimsy reasoning behind it. The mulefa and Mary Malone's work
  together amounts to nothing, everyone just goes home. Presumably,
  Will goes home, although we never see it. All that yearning after
  his mother and so forth . . .nothing. The major enemies are
  killed off too easily - and what about Armageddon? What happened
  to the Fortress and all the rebel angels and . . .you get the
  idea. It all just sort of disovles. Mary forgot to be the
  Serpent, or else I missed that in one of the countless pages on
  the mulefa. Another reader pointed out: " Phillip Pullman could
  have written a masterpiece with this series. Instead, the story
  falls flat under the weight of the author's own agendas and
  mockeries. What a waste of time. I can't believe this book
  actually won awards. It stopped being thought-provoking and
  started being inane and silly." It would have been better if Lyra
  had just awakened one morning and it was all a dream. Instead,
  relearning how to read the alethiometer will somehow enable her
  to build the Kingdom of Heaven in the course of her lifetime.
  Absurd. This was one of the most disappointing and infuriating
  reads of my life.</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">'Clownhouse' is mainly associated with a sex
  scandal involving the director and the youngest boy actor. While
  hearing of Salva's conviction when 'Jeepers Creepers' came out, I
  never knew it had anything to do with this movie, nor had I ever
  heard of this in the first place. I actually stumbled upon this
  looking to see if there was a horror movie involving clowns
  besides 'It', and came across this weird little 'Halloween'-like
  suspense tale. While the sex scandal never once popped into my
  head (except when there was a pointless and gratuitous butt shot
  of the kid), I still didn't care for this too much, despite its
  pluses. Like 'Halloween', this film relies on suspense rather
  than gore to creep people out, but sadly, it didn't really get to
  me. If I was about 9 or so, this would've scared the hell out of
  me. I'm not saying I hated this; it was all right and had some
  geniune chills and some fantastic images, but because you see who
  the clowns are before they find the house and start terrorizing
  the children, it lost some effect for me. I would have liked it
  better if I had no idea what was going on, and it would've been a
  creepier experience. Horror movie fans should like this, even
  though I personally thought it would be better. The atmosphere is
  very, very creepy, and the clowns are actually pretty terrifying
  in their own way, but it just didn't do it for me. Rent it

  <Text category="music">After two albums of wholly instrumental music,
  Joe Satriani apparently decided it was time to start singing.
  "Flying in a Blue Dream" is the only Satriani record with several
  (six) vocal cuts. So how are they? Well, Satch's voice isn't
  superb, but he does an ok job. The problem really is with the
  material-- it's clear he'd gotten used to writing pieces as
  guitar features. The only real exception to this in my assessment
  is frantic electric blues "Big Bad Moon"-- the piece is blazing
  and explosive, the vocal is passable, and Satriani is on fire.
  But pieces like "Ride", "The Phone Call" and "Strange" are all
  pretty much forgettable (well, "Ride" is actually a bit too
  irritating to be forgettable...). The remainder of the material
  is a mix between exploratory (and primarily acoustic) pieces
  ("The Feeling") which are nice but largley filler and "Surfing
  With the Alien" styled instrumentals ("One Big Rush", "Back to
  Shalla-Bal"). The exception is the chugging opener and title
  track, "Flying in a Blue Dream", which features Satriani at his
  most lyrical as a guitarist. Invariably, the album is a bit too
  weak for its own good-- it's probably also a bit too long (about
  65 minutes) and probably would have benefited from being trimmed
  down a bit. Start with "Surfing With the Alien", come back to

  <Text category="book">Eliot Cohen has an impressive background in
  policy work (OSD) and academia (Naval War College and Harvard). I
  had high hopes for this book because I thought his experience
  with the military combined with his academic work would produce a
  focused and well-grounded work. I was disappointed. I never
  really bought his argument that political leaders can lead war
  better than generals. He seemed to cherry pick leaders than fit
  his mold. I could not believe that someone who works so closely
  with the military would generalize military leadership in such a
  stereotypical way. The article might have made a good article in
  a foreign affairs journal, but the author seemed to fill out the
  book with a lot of interesting but not really relevant historical
  stories and facts. The Lincoln chapter providing nothing that has
  not been stated numerous times in more detailed and focused work.
  The Churchill chapter was the best. Cohen obviously has
  extensively studied Churchill. His sections on how the historical
  view of Churchill have ebbed and flowed over the years was well
  done, thought not rally tied to the focus of the book. I learned
  the most from the Ben-Gurion, since I knew the least about him.
  The book may be useful to an undergraduate class studying
  political leadership or foreign policy, but beyond that the book
  unfortunately offers little that is new or of great
  interest.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">We looked for a trash truck that our 4 year
  old boy could play with. On the surface, the Bruder looked the
  part. Not as cartoon-looking as some, the fact that it looked
  like a real trash truck but had few obvious breakable parts made
  it seem like an ideal choice. Actual play testing though shows
  this product isn't very well-built, at least not enough to
  withstand normal wear and tear. This truck wasn't subjected to
  being thrown down the stairs, jumped on, etc. It's been just
  played with, but it started coming apart quickly. The hinged door
  in the back of the truck is a poor design. The plastic hinges on
  the truck are too thin, and break easily. The plastic hinges on
  the door start to bend after multiple open/closes, and the
  plastic weakens and breaks off. The hinged front compartment and
  rear sections are difficult to operate, and stick easily. Items
  put into the cab (like the essential green army man who drives
  the truck) easily get caught in here and are very difficult to
  remove. Worse though is the key point of this toy, the ability to
  latch the trash can to the lifting/dumping mechanism. This is way
  to complex for a child, and the intricacy in getting a solid
  connect is difficult even for an adult. If it's not hooked up
  right, the can falls off when you try to lift it; very
  frustrating. Some little pieces (rear view mirror, etc) broke off
  easily and early on, but we kind of expected this. The parts were
  simply too small and fragile to last long. I don't hold this part
  against the design; part of the attraction was that it looked
  like a real truck, and I don't think there's an easy way to add
  small details without some fragility. While this is orignally was
  one of my sons favorite toys, he can't really play with it the
  way he'd like to. While he still enjoys driving it around the
  house, he can't pick up the trash and dump it without an adults
  help, and that's a shame. For the price, I expected so much
  more.</Text>

  Nor does it convey the proper mood in many points during the

  company produces, for examle, two regular albums; two best
  albums; two tribute albums; and finally two mixture of everything
  under a sounds-like-new-but-actually-an-old albums from a
  musician. This is an example of the mixture of previously
  released, re-released, at last, over-released best tracks with a
  sounds-like-regular album title. Let me tell you one thing. JP is
  dead and gone since Rob left the band. I doubt there will be more
  regular JP albums but you'll have plenty of compilations like
  this coming out until you stop buying</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">When we tried to play the item on our DVD
  player the beginning and the end were all garbled and we had to
  return it. We ordered another copy direct from the manufacturer,
  which worked properly. I am upset that the full purchase price
  was not refunded. I can see deducting shipping and handling. But,
  a restocking charge -- that is outrageous! The merchandise did
  not work properly and there was no offer made to replace it!
  Please remind me not to buy from amazon.com</Text>
  <Text category="health">First of all I was very disappointed when I
  received my Waterpik CF-203C Cascadia showerhead. It is all
  plastic! I do not recall seeing that anywhere in the product
  specs. I thought when I oredered a chrome finish that it was some
  form of metal. Sedondly, even with the head made of plastic, the
  plasic flexible hose is not strong enough to support it. We could
  not use it because the hose would just hang there and spray the
  wall. We installed it repeatedly, following each step of the
  instructions every time, thinking we were missing something. I
  eventually returned the showerhead to Amazon</Text>

  it now on my arms with no problems. I do feel it is very
  expensive for so little product so will not repurchase</Text>
  <Text category="music">As for many of these kind of unknown groups,
  the music in the album is useless. In the meaning that this music
  has no use. It is not relaxing. It is not for contemplation. It
  is not spiritual. It is nothing but electronic esperiments that
  many vendors try to deliver under the name of "ambient". But
  ambient music is music. THis is crap. Well differently from TWO
  A.D. where probably the producers realized that crap is crap and
  no more crap was good to be sold, because people isn't stupid.
  TWO A.D. is light years away from this crap. Don't waste your
  money. Listen the the samples by yourself to grab what I mean.

  <Text category="dvd">I only gave this movie one star because it is
  against Amazon's rules to give it no stars. After hearing that
  this was a Christian movie, I could not wait to watch it.
  However, this movie has nothing in common with Christianity,
  quite the contrary, this is the most anti-Christian movie that I
  have ever seen; it promotes murder and other unsurpassable evil.
  The movie started out horribly and just continued to get worse.
  For instance, the beginning of the movie was shockingly
  pornographic. In a supposedly "Christian" movie I did not expect
  to be bombarded with this. After seeing this I did not expect
  that the movie could possibly get worse. However, I was greatly
  mistaken. Later in the movie the main character, who was
  remarkably unsympathetic, met several of her Christian co-workers
  who were talking about something they called "the pearl dream."
  Intrigued, the main character asked them what this dream was. Of
  course, they were unable to answer because it is complete
  nonsense. None the less, the main character continues to review
  what her co-workers have told her about Christianity over the
  years. As the movie plods along, generally confusing and boring
  the viewer, she comes to the decision to give up her sinful
  lifestyle and turn to God. When this event transpired I assumed,
  wrongly, that from this point forward the film would redeem its
  beginning and maybe even say something good about Christianity.
  This, however, is where the movie went form being merely bad to
  astoundingly sacrilegious. Then, the main character and her young
  daughter set out for the desert. Due to a vague dream, they
  believed that this was God's will and that He would appear in the
  desert and take them to heaven, in other words "rapture" them.
  How they came to this assumption I was never quite sure. The
  movie often made ludicrous statements which never made the
  slightest amount of sense. I became extremely weary trying to
  deduce what was happening. Nothing that took place in this movie
  was remotely Biblical nor was it well explained. As time passed
  our characters continued to sit in the desert, boring the viewer
  to tears. They begin to suspect that God was not coming to gather
  them to heaven and they started to despair. This is where the
  movie became intolerably anti-Christian; the mother took her
  daughter up to a mountain and asked her to kneel. She then forced
  her daughter to pray. After the prayer was concluded she took a
  gun from her dress and shot her crying daughter, supposedly to
  send her to heaven. She "believes" that she is doing God's will.
  Obviously, she was such an idiot that she failed to read that the
  Bible that strictly forbids murder. Afterwards, she is sent to
  prison, where we hope to see her suffer for her cruel, viscous,
  and insurmountably stupid act. As she is sitting in her cell,
  blaming God for the murder of her daughter, that she willingly
  committed (If she had half a brain cell she would have realized
  that she was doing Satan's will, not God's), she hears trumpets
  and the cell walls start to fall in. A few scenes pass, in which
  the ghost of her daughter returns and tries to redeem her faith.
  She, however, refuses. Then, she is taken to a dark room, that
  the viewer is supposed to believe is some supernatural place
  where judgment takes place, and asks if she loves God. She
  replies no, because she blames Him for her insanity. The film
  concludes with her standing stupidly in a dark room, that failed
  to represent eternity. Most of the aspects included in the film
  were never explained. Such as the significance of "the pearl
  dream." Nor was it explained why they believed that they needed
  to wait in the desert. How did they contrive this ridiculous idea
  from a vague, ambiguous, and utterly vapid dream anyway? None of
  these questions were ever answered. This caused the film to feel
  incomplete. The stories between scenes shifted so drastically
  that I suspected I had missed several important scenes. After
  checking my DVD I realized that I had not accidentally skipped
  crucial scenes, because their were none. This film was
  deliberately ambiguous and vapid. Also, the special effects,
  cinematography, and acting were about as good as a preschool
  play. None of the actors put any emotion into their roles. They
  recited their lines like drugged zombies; I suppose even they
  realized it was complete rubbish and decided not to put much
  effort into it. To state the obvious, this film is a disgrace!
  Obviously, it is not Biblically based. It does NOT represent
  Christian philosophy which is to love others, not to wander
  around aimlessly in the desert acting like a fool. Nor do
  Christians promote murder, as this film implied. This movie has
  as much religious value as Night of the Blind Nazi Zombies. I am
  ashamed to see that such a complete travesty is labeled a
  Christian film. This film is extremely anti-Christian; its main
  objective is to give the world the false impression that
  fundamentalist Christians are brainwashed and are incapable of
  sane thoughts. This is not true, and yes, I can prove it. All the
  proof that you need is contained in the Bible. If you stop
  hardening your heart and truly listen with an open mind then you
  cannot help but to see Jesus loving message for the world. He
  does not desire to bring misery to the world, but happiness and
  love. The reason that there is misery in the world is because
  people, like those who made this film, disobey God. If we
  followed His loving rules then we would not suffer. I do not
  write this rather long review out of hatred, as I am sure many
  will accuse me of. I write this to warn people what this movie is
  really about. It is not a true Christian movie like the Left
  Behind's and The Passion of the Christ. And, yes I am aware that
  I will be bombarded by a slough of negative votes. However, I do
  not even faintly care. My beliefs, as a fundamentalist Christian
  and my love of God is more important to me than a number on a
  page. Also, I was shocked to read the other reviews on this
  forum, especially the one from the Wiccan woman who said that she
  wished to see Christians thrown to the lions as they were in the
  time of the Romans. I have seen a lot of hatred in my life but
  her review was by far the worst I have ever see. Christians love
  the world and those in it, we do not tell non-Christians about
  Christ to imply that we are "holier than thou" because we are
  not. All are equal under God's eyes. We are all sinners and the
  only way to attain redemption is to accept God's undeserved
  grace. We tell other people about God's undeserved love because
  we want to save them and see them living in eternal joy in
  Heaven. We do not rejoice to see people unsaved, we tell them
  about their condition because we want to see them saved. In other
  words, we tell people because we love them. Also, for those of
  you who accuse Christians of having a hatred of the world, why do
  you spew hatred in everything you say toward Christians? Aren't
  you displaying the hatred that you claim you abhor? In
  conclusion, this is the worst movie ever made. It is
  anti-Christian, immensely sacrilegious, poorly acted, poorly
  written, vapid, mind numbingly dull, disjointed, tortuously long,
  etc. In short, this film is an abomination. It is massively
  offensive to Christians and is a massive misrepresentation of
  Christian values. Also, the acting is abysmal and the story line
  hopelessly confusing. If you wish to watch a film that accurately
  portrays Christian values then I recommend watch "The Passion of
  the Christ" or the Left Behind movies. I hope that this review
  will help you; it was written with love and concern. I shall keep
  you in my prayers. Have a wonderful new year. In Christ, Ravenova

  <Text category="toys_games">American Pastoral was repetitious to the Nth
  degree. I read the Human Stain a few years ago, and it was good.
  But, in Pastoral, the reader is put through a zillion
  permutations of possible dialogs between the Swede and a
  psychoanalyst, and between his daughter Merry and a
  psychoanalyst, but absent the psychoanalyst: Roth is our
  psychoanalyst. What he misses, however, is that we simply have to
  realize that interpersonal dynamics are sometimes beyond our
  control. The Swede never failed as a father; rather, he failed
  because he couldn't let go of his sense of responsibility for
  her</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I gave this to my fiance for Christmas, who
  loves Sudoku and video games, so I thought it would be a
  brilliant combination. He was excited, but has been frustrated by
  how not easy it is to play. He can't always tell where the cursor
  is on the board, so if he sets it down for a minute, he can't see
  where's he's left off. Then when he was playing in the semi-dark
  while we were on a train, he couldn't see anything either
  (backlight would be a nice feature). It just seems this model is
  not designed very intuitively: he keeps wanting to press clear to
  change a number, but it clears the game. all that to say, 2
  million puzzles sounds great...unless it's too frustrating to
  play</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">I have now seen several Gerry Anderson
  projects, many hits and some misses, this one is close to dead
  last for me (wait, it is dead last). A priest driving a model T
  is the hero in this one. He also has a shrinking ray (shrinks to
  like 1/3 normal) that he uses on his assistant who is a
  groundskeeper/secret agent. Sound interesting? Well, I got the
  set cheap so why not buy it? If your an Anderson fan as I am, it
  was worth the price, just don't expect to show it to your friends
  as it's really tame and slow plodding with model T car chases and
  not a whole lot of action. Here is my ranking of the shows I like
  from Gerry Anderson so take that into account of your own tastes.
  #1 UFO (a live adult sci-fi show with some great character
  development), #2 Joe 90(the concept is great and the non
  continuous storylines work good here), #3 Captain Scarlet (I love
  the concept and a lot of the shows fit in with the current war on
  terror to me), #4 Thunderbirds (had a Corgi toy as a kid, it was
  the best show for kids on TV at the time), #5 Stingray (for the
  time, it was a great action kids show), #6 Fireball XL5 (like a
  Stingray except in space and black and white), #7 The Protectors
  (eh, it's OK), #8 Space 1999 (this is where my recommended shows
  stop, this show was so highly anticipated and quickly got really
  stupid even I couldn't stay with it in the 70's),#9 Terrahawks
  (just started watching it now it may move up above Space 1999 and
  the Protectors), #10 Secret Service. I haven't watched his other
  stuff and I know there is stuff out there like Supercar but that
  would probably rank above Secret Service for me.</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">The story here dosen't matter. The main
  characters fuse into a missle of meth and insanity towards an
  explosive ending. Scwartzman escapes his fate temporarily and
  murphy is blessed with a reprieve but rourke pays the full price
  for his evil concoction, meth. Quirky directing and film editing
  can be somewhat distracting but not meaningless. Roberts is so
  gay you want to smack his face. he an rourke have history on film
  and play out their familiarity. Rourke is phenomonal again as an
  immoral genius, a role he plays better than anyone today in film.

  <Text category="dvd">Don't know about anyone else, but the DVD I
  purchased had lousy video. The only good shots were of closeups
  and sometimes it took the cameraman a few seconds to focus on a
  number of the shots. All of the long distance shots were grainy
  and not clear and the medium range shots were not good either. I
  know the concert was indoors, but I've seen other indoor videos
  that did not have this problem. Did I get a bad DVD or did anyone

  <Text category="toys_games">I bought this iron for my teen daughters -

  <Text category="book">So this page-turning thriller was on the
  best-selling list for a gazillion months and put Catholic and
  fellow Christian faithful in a defensive uproar. I'm fairly well
  read and, yes, I've earned a few bucks with my prose. I'm also a
  sucker for historic tales, ancient folklore, mythology and Old
  Testament characters who lived for 800 years and begat like
  rabbits. OK, I decided, now that it's in paperback, I'll give it
  a read. What I concluded was this: Those who found The Da Vinci
  Code an affront to their faith could have could have ended the
  argument before it reached the level of theological debate by
  countering that Brown's work is a literary steaming pile. I read
  page after page, waiting for the moment when I would start to
  give a rat's ass about The Da Vinci Code's protagonists. What a
  bunch of twits. Langdon is a leading authority in the obscure
  field of symbology (I don't know if I spelled that right, but I'm
  not about to go back in that book and check it). Apparently,
  there are enough people in the world who crave more symbology
  that Langdon's books sell better than Brown's, entitling him to
  the academia equivalent of rock start status. Sophie is
  effectively portrayed as a cuddly French chick who's easy on the
  eyes -- someone a man might make a hit on before the first 300
  pages if he wasn't a dipwad like Landgon. She's got some inner
  deamons that make her interesting enough, but she's been isolated
  from folks like you and me in a cradle of artsy culture so
  high-falluting most French probably couldn't tolerate it. And
  then they hook up with that insufferable aristocratic British
  snob Teabing. From cradle to some approptiately haught estate
  near (but, of course) Versaille, this memeber of the Royal Lucky
  Sperm Club has never had to lift a finger to earn buck or a pound
  or a Euro. So he's been free to pursue his fascination with
  Bigfoot rumors about how the Priory of Sion, Opus Dei and those
  cool Holy Grail Knights from the third Indiana Jones movie have
  contrived through the centuries to keep the lid on damning
  evidence that Jesus made a baby girl and God had originally
  intended women to be in charge of everything. Or something like
  that. Oh, I forgot, Teabing's crippled so I should feel bad about
  talking bad about him. Anyway, this trio of prententious
  intellectual clods sit around do what pretentious intellectual
  clods do -- make lofty, self-affirmed pronouncments about how the
  world's going to turn upside down when this cat gets out of the
  bag. The point is that these characters aren't very approachable
  and Brown does little to convince me that this secret will
  destroy Christian faith as we know it. Hell, it's been more than
  100 years since Darwin presented pretty clear evidence for
  evolution, yet the Christian faithtul still pack churches around
  world. But back to how bad this book is. Trite doesn't begin to
  describe some of the wincing turns of phrase. I would give you
  some examples but, like I said, I'm not going back in there. One
  of the more laughable scenes of upper-crust idiocy occurs when
  Langdon and Sophie meet up with Teabing in his metrosexual
  parlor. By now, Sophie and Langdon have somehow eluded the grasp
  of professional killers several times, been on the run and are
  exhausted. With a straight face, Brown describes how Sophie's
  delirium is sated by a spot of tea and her hunger is satisfied
  by... crumpets. Yes, crumpets. Hell, Teabing, shut up about your
  conspiracy theories, roust your beligernet butler and have him
  fix these people something to eat. Offer Langdon a stiff drink. I
  sure needed one at this point. By now I'm pulling for the albino.
  Then they escape the jaws of death yet again and, naturally,
  high-tail it to England on Teabing's private jet. I hoped maybe
  Teabow would turn back upon discovering he'd left his Grey Poupon
  behind. I stopped reading it about 30 pages later when it became
  clear that the Albino wasn't going to get a chance to wack any of
  these intrepid protagonists. I don't know how it ends. I don't
  care. However, there were plenty enough nuggets of research on
  the subject to entice me into watching a few nice documentaries
  laying out this whole conspiracy on the History Channel and
  Discovery. Who knows? You might like it. This is just my
  opinion</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">I will be honest I like Dolph
  Lundgren.........a look at his filmography you see B.movie
  classics such as "The Punisher",Universal Soldier" and
  "Blackjack" Dolph has been going trough a slump.........Storm
  Catcher and the startlingly routine Jill The Ripper and the awful
  Minion(AKA Fallen Knight) but with Agent Red Dolph Lundgren hits
  rock bottom. Agent Red first of all steals it's music from
  Predator 2......and it's plot from Counter Measures,Oh I'm not
  finished yet. It steals footage from Storm Catcher!!!!!!!!! The
  scene where Jon Penner steals the air craft while posing as Dolph
  Lundgren..........Now Penner is 5'11 Dolph Lundgren is 6'5 for
  goodness sake! yet they try to pass it off as Dolph Lundgren as
  the soldier stealing the aircraft for part of a mission.....This
  scene made me wanna throw up but I hung in there.....It turns out
  more footage is stolen.......I swear I saw footage from Iron
  Eagle and Iron Eagle II.......I saw footage from Crimson Tide and
  I saw footage from Counter Measures........What the heck was
  Dolph thinking when he signed for this junk? I have no idea. When
  I was a teen (When Showdown In Little Tokyo came out) I thought
  Dolph Lundgren couldn't sink lower then Showdown In Little
  Tokyo,Then when I saw The Minion I was almost sure Dolph couldn't
  do worse........Well I pray he can't do any worse because Agent
  Red is one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my
  life..........This is coming from a guy who likes Don The Dragon
  Wilson. Bottomline:On Agent Red's cover it says "Once exposed you
  cannot survive" Take this as a warning</Text>
  <Text category="book">While I realize that the majority of people
  thought this to be a stellar book, it reminds me of the story,
  "The Emperor has no clothes". Yes, Choan can write a beautiful
  sentence and yes, the first several pages were intriguing but the
  switching of years was very annoying. The "flipping back and
  forth" was not accomplished in a smooth, flowing manner. In
  addition, the subject matter was incredibly depressing and the
  characters were so flawed that one did not even care about how
  their lives evolved. The kidnapping was predictable and the
  ending contrived. It would be impossible to recommend this book
  to anyone</Text>
  <Text category="music">I sorta of agree with the person below, This
  album sucks....plain and simple, however I think he is still
  doing a great job in Rhapsody. I gave it one star not so much
  because it is garbage, but becuase I was looking forward to this
  album since "Prophets of the Last Eclipse" Which was great, but
  trully...I don't know went wrong. I don't have a problem with
  female vocalists, but in this album...it is retched. I don't
  think I will ever listen to this album ever again. Sorry! But its
  true...do not buy this album, pretend you never knew he had a new
  album...OH! and do NOT buy Luca Turilli's Dreamquest either!

  would rate it: Story-3 Stars Actors-4 Stars Music-4 Stars
  Ending-0 Stars Overall- 2 Stars I am not insulting Disney, I
  think it came out just how "they" wanted it to. And, as with most

  <Text category="book">&amp;amp;quot;Our attention is the most

  not sure everyone would agree. But this is the way he would like
  to slice the whole matter of information technology, the media,
  etc., etc., and that's fine. Shenk's standpoint is amazingly
  isolated and will make sense only to an elite ensconced in the
  same high fallutin' mix of punditry/technology/leisure time he
  is. Information overload, or &amp;amp;quot;data
  smog&amp;amp;quot; as the author terms it, is certainly a
  relevant and important area to explore, but Shenk, in is
  privileged world, really can't nail down what might be so
  detrimental about it. His examples illustrate just how removed
  his is from the vast majority of American society:
  minute-by-minute news reports diluting the quality of info and
  the ability to sort it, not feeling so apt to respond to your
  friends' email because you get too much, the end of patience? As
  he represents it in &amp;amp;quot;the end of
  patience,&amp;amp;quot; data smog really ain't no big woop--it's
  just some tacks on the erogomic seats of a pampered minority into
  which Shenk seems to fit. Where's the politics, I wonder? How
  does this trivia fit into the lives of Middle Americans or
  working people? To the point, Shenk might benefit from a step or
  two away from his computer. Rubbing shoulders with the common
  folk might hip him to serious problems like acne or Monday Night

  <Text category="dvd">Fifty-five minutes into this film, after Freya
  (Jane March) listens to the Beast's explanation of his current
  condition--it is the punishment of Odin for killing a bear--she
  says, "What does it mean? It makes no sense." Although there is
  still half an hour yet to come, these eight words pretty much sum
  up this low-budget variant of "Beauty and the Beast." The very
  title BLOOD OF BEASTS (plural) makes no sense. The film shows us
  only one beast--a kind of man-bear--and he is a revived and
  metamorphosed version of Odin's pet bear, blended or fused with
  the man who killed it. Academic scholars might argue that
  swaggering-but-cowardly Sven (played by William Gregory Lee) is a
  kind of beast as well (thus giving us TWO beasts), but we have no
  way of knowing what the writer and director intended. Most likely
  the title was devised by somebody in the marketing department who
  had not seen the film. Surely the blurb on the back of the DVD's
  hard case was written by another marketing person who never
  watched it either; e.g., it is untrue that Freya "must undertake
  a deadly battle when her father and fiance are captured by a
  tormented monster . . . cast out by his people." Nor is it true
  that "the Beast [singular] . . . battles with Freya for his
  redemption." Further, expect no truth in these grand-sounding
  words: "Prepare for the ultimate tale of love and sacrifice,
  damnation and salvation." BTW, the front of the hard case has a
  fake sepia picture of Jane March/Freya shooting an arrow in an
  impossible manner: the arrow's shaft is two or three inches ABOVE
  her hand that's gripping the bow. With one exception, the acting
  is a perfect match for the script: laughably poor. The exception
  is the Beast (played by David Dukas). One is tempted to quip that
  only this role has "teeth"; the fact is that only his role
  permits audio engineers (or whoever) to enhance the actor's voice
  electronically, only his role required serious make-up, and only
  his role required a "special effect" (his morphing back to Agnar,
  which every semi-conscious viewer, by a third of the way into the
  film, knew was coming). Other viewers have commented on the
  comical tropical setting of this Viking saga and the laughable
  "ships." Most preposterous is the tiny skiff that Freya and
  Ingrid (Candice Hillebrand) use to rescue King Thorsson (Greg
  Melvill-Smith). On the island, the Beast possesses an iron cage
  (which clearly has been welded together using 20th- or
  21st-century equipment); when the king is confined in it, it can
  only be secured from the outside--and yet, when Freya is put
  inside it for her own protection at night, only she has control
  of its locking device. How convenient. The costumes are also
  anacronistically interesting, but only Ms. March's deserve
  extended comment. When we first see her, she is wearing a little
  black Viking bikini as she swims with friends; then, besides
  flimsy chain mail, we see her in an array of gowns that seem to
  be fashoned from finely woven or knit fabrics--the final one
  being most noteworthy for its sequined molded push-up bra-top.
  Lest this review seem too harsh, a few individuals connected with
  this film deserve special mention for their outstanding
  contributions: Mark Thomas, who composed the Viking music; Rob
  Bishop, one of the focus pullers; Ryan Lotter and Steven Ndlovu,
  two clapper loaders; Andrew Gribble, a grip; Ben Phiri, the
  generator operator; Guy Bonner, transport manager; Johannes
  Sithole, fabrication assistant; Kirsty Taylor, prosthetics;
  Maxmillian van der Merwe, standby set dresser; Dirk Knoesen,
  stand-by [sic] carpenter; Sally van der Merwe, scenic artists
  [sic]; Janine Wyatt-Mair, stunt performer; Grace Sibiyo,
  seamstress; Diane Allen, hair supervisor; Bianca, trainee make-up
  assistant; Ian Thysse, medic; and Mark Ferda, who did double duty
  as both dialogue editor AND re-recording mixer. Oh, one more
  thing: after coming out of her cage in the morning, Jane March
  SEEMS to have a nude swim in the sea, which the poor Beast views
  from hiding, far-far-far away</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Synopsis (including Ending): Don Ameche
  (Gino), a Chicago shoe shine man, is approached by the mafia to
  go to jail for "3 to 5 years" to take the place of their Mafia
  boss accused of murder because he bears a striking resemblance to
  him. They'll pay him yearly and satisfy his lifelong dream of
  fishing on a boat. Joe Mantegna (Jerry) takes Don Ameche (Gino)
  on a 3 day vacation to satisfy his every wish before he's
  incarcerated. Joe Mantegna is on probation from the Mob, after
  disobeying orders from a previous job. Joe Mantegna goes "outside
  channels" to take Don Ameche (Gino) to Lake Tahoe to the "Galaxy"
  Hotel where they stay, wine and dine, and try to have a good
  time. Things turn difficult when a local real Mafia Boss brings
  Don Ameche (Gino) to his house as a guest and they form a bond.
  The real Mafia Boss has a gathering of crime bosses planned and
  Don Ameche and Joe Mantegna are caught in the middle. They escape
  the gathering and on the day Don Ameche is brought back to
  Chicago, Joe Mantegna is ordered to kill Don Ameche and make it
  look like a suicide. "It's cleaner this way...", he's told. Joe
  Mantegna refuses the order, and the film ends with a Mafia
  employee testifying in court and getting sentenced to jail for 20
  years to life. The Good: Joe Mantegna is an underrated actor
  generally and it was nice to see a familiar face in the real
  Mafia Boss in Lake Tahoe. Other than that, there's nothing else
  going for this one except a slightly funny scene with the
  concierge. The Bad: The Mob wants tough guys, right? This is a
  comedy, right? No ones a tough guy and there's no laughs. Joe
  Mantegna plays a sissy instead of a Mafia tough guy. Don Ameche
  plays a senile acting senior with no personality. I wanted to
  like this film but I coulden't because it was very slow, very
  boring and none of the characters were interesting. We never have
  a scene with the real Mafia Boss that looks like Don Amecha and
  the two never meet. You would expect a friendly "Thanks for going
  to jail for 3 to 5 years for me" but it doesn't happen. At the
  end someone for the Mob is dressed up like the real Mafia Boss
  and he's testifying in court and gets sentenced to jail. He
  doesn't look anything like Don Ameche or the real Mafia Boss and
  yet, he's right there taking the fall. If the film didn't need to
  depend on Don Ameche's appearance, why didn't they send him to
  jail from the beginning? The worst David Mamet experience I've
  had. Very surprising stinker. The Characters: If Don Ameche
  played a less passive character he would have been more
  interesting. If Joe Mantegna showed more conflict as a character
  with reasons behind them, he would have been more interesting. As
  the film stands, they're both flat. Don Ameche had no personality
  and his only lines are the ones other characters used. When a
  character says something, you can be sure Don Ameche repeats it
  30 minutes later like a senile robot. Don Ameche's dialogue
  leaves a lot to be desired. Add to that his boring and stale
  acting in this film. He played very dumb, not interesting, like a
  real man in crisis about to go to jail for money. Overall, Joe
  Mantegna was not believable as a Mafia hired hand. Don Ameche was
  too passive and uninteresting, and Joe Mantegna is too passive
  and stale. Scene Criticism: A couple scenes stand out as being
  very weak and unrealistic. (Gas Station scene where Joe Mantegna
  is given $3 more in gas than he asked for) Joe Mantegna is
  working for the mob, and he asks for $1 of gas, and gets $4. He
  doesn't have the cash to pay, and when the gas attendant takes
  the car keys his reaction is "Please, please, please" A real Mob
  guy would punch the gas attendant, take back the keys, and leave
  for the plane they were late for. A mob guy that won't defend
  himself for $3? (Scene with Don Ameche offered money to go to
  jail for 3 to 5 years) Don Ameche doesn't put up a fight or try
  to leave the room, and is too passive. We don't learn about his
  past or his life or family. There's not enough time spent on the
  offer, and the scene was over valued for it's lasting value.
  (Bedroom scene with Joe Mantegna trying to let Don Ameche escape)
  Joe Mantegna had no real connection to Don Ameche's character to
  justify the scene. Instead it's 2 strangers. Personal Commentary:
  The test for a comedy for me is - "how many times did I laugh?"
  This film never made me laugh. I'm shocked the film costs $24.99
  on DVD. Rent it instead. It belongs in the $1 bin at Wal-mart.
  Writing Criticism: Lines like "He's the guy behind the guy behind
  the guy behind the guy" and lines like "A big man knows the value
  of a small coin" and the story about the grasshopper and the ant
  make no sense. The writing is drivel. Alternative Recommended
  Film: "Trading Places" with Dan Aykroyd and Eddie Murphy and also
  Don Ameche, albeit in a smaller role</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">Let me start by saying that I may need to quit
  listening to the opinions of some of my co-workers in regards to
  movies to watch, at least when it comes to the horror genre.
  Numerous people where I work told me that this movie, "The
  Descent" was absolutely one of the best horror movies ever to be
  made. In their defense, my co-workers weren't the only people
  with this opinion, many critics and other moviegoers said the
  same thing. Well, apparently the hype that was built up for me
  regarding this movie was more than the film could live up to,
  because I was sorely disappointed, but more on that later, for
  now I will give you my plot summary for last year's supposed
  horror spectacular, "The Descent" "The Descent" begins with a
  young woman on vacation with her family and friends, when her
  husband and her daughter suffer a tragic accident. One year later
  at the prodding of those same friends, she accompanies them on a
  spelunking adventure, the problem is none of her friends have
  ever been to this cave, in fact it's a newly discovered cave that
  no one has explored as yet. So as they attempt to explore the
  unexplored these brave young women become trapped in the cave.
  Making matters worse, this cave is not like any ordinary cave,
  for this one is inhabited by bloodthirsty mutant creatures who
  have just found their next meal. At the beginning of watching
  this movie I was really interested in the developing story, and
  the shocking opener really caught my attention, giving me a sense
  that this movie is going to be different than most horror movies
  by actually giving you the unexpected. However, once the story
  gets to the part where the girls are inside the cave, which is
  actually where the majority of the film takes place, things begin
  to go awry for the picture. At first, the filmmakers were doing a
  good job of using the claustrophobic atmosphere, giving the
  audience a sense of entrapment and anxiety which served to
  heighten the suspense regarding the possibility of impending
  doom. Then the filmmakers introduce a fact that I felt completely
  derailed the movie, this is a cave that no one has been in, and
  these girls are hardly professional. So, who in their right mind
  would put all of their friends lives in possible jeopardy just to
  be the first to explore a newly discovered cave. It's absolutely
  stupid, especially when placed viewed in the context of the
  character's interaction and companionship with each other, none
  of these girls would do this to each other. After this occurs the
  mutants show up, a plot point that I was hoping would help put
  the movie back in the right direction; however, this is where the
  movie begins to unwind even faster, because it's now just one
  gory scene after another, and the movie is nothing more than your
  average monster movie. A decision I somewhat agreed with, yet
  still didn't agree with was the decision to keep the mutants
  origins unknown. On the one hand this served to add to the
  mystery of why they are attacking these girls, you just assume
  they're cannibalistic, but on the other it would have been nice
  to know how they got there. Even though "The Descent" was hyped
  as being one of the best horror movies of recent time, by both my
  friends and many critics and moviegoers, to me it was merely
  another average addition to a genre that is already full of
  mediocrity. "The Descent" is unrated and contains violence and
  language</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">Let me accept the fact that LOTR is my most
  beloved film and I already own the extended editions of the films
  in one set! I'm really not surprised to see New Line coming up
  with another edition of the trilogy. With films like these they
  will squeeze the collectors as much as they can!! Still, inspite
  of this new set containing both the theatrical versions and the
  extended cuts of the films and also the much hyped Costa Botes
  documentaries, my advise to anyone buying LOTR for the first time
  is- DO NOT BUY THIS SET! Spend a little more and you get all the
  movies in full 6.1 DTS EX glory, alongwith hours of endless
  in-depth bonus features which probably you'll spend rest of your
  life watching!! Please be aware, these new editions DO NOT
  contain DTS tracks, no commentary tracks by the director, Weta
  workshop or the cast. All you get is both versions crammed into
  one single disc and just one documentary as a bonus on the second
  disc...AND NOTHING ELSE. It would have been a better idea had New
  Line released the documentaries separately without forcing the
  consumer to buy the films again....And even this is not the end,
  once the HD format gains a little more acceptance, they'll have
  another excuse to come up with a new version of the trilogy!
  Beware, Extended edition set is the ultimate LOTR experience, in
  terms of films or bonus features. Go get it...Its worth all the
  money spent!</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">If you've read the book this movies is
  EXTREMELY loosely based on, you will understand why the movie is
  so horrid. It's beautiful to look at, but that is all. The sets
  and costumes are gorgeous, but it looks more like a bunch of kids
  playing dress up than a film about a Queen of France. This movie
  completely ignores the Revolution, Marie Antoinette's arrest, and
  murder. In short, the movie ignores anything that is not pretty,
  girlish, and light. There is so much fluff and teen angst that
  it's hard to locate any fact in the film at all. Do we really
  need a 10 close-up of Kristen Dunst wistfully lazing about her
  apartments after she meets a handsome man? Even one scene like
  this is bad enough, but it happens over and over. We see kids at
  play more than adults with real problems, and the actors and
  soundtrack only reinforce this feeling. There is shopping, food,
  dress up, and flirting, but minus a handful of very short scenes,
  no real account of the lives of the King and Queen of France.
  There was little in the way of dialog, and sadly much of what
  there was was murmured while Dunst flounced around in her pretty
  dresses. There is so much historical inaccuracy in the film that
  it's almost pointless to try to listen to the dialog. For
  instance, the Dauphin and 2 brothers, which we are told in the
  book the film is "based" on. However, in the film, the brothers
  are combined into one, very inaccurate character. Marie
  Antoinette also had 2 sons, not one as the movie will tell you. I
  don't mind some changes for the sake of drama, but ignoring 90%
  of a historical account and then insisting that your movie is
  factual is ridiculous. The main actors are also terrible. The
  supporting cast, such as Rip Torn, and Marriane Faithful, is
  wonderful. They only serve to make Kirsten Dunst look that much
  worse. No one bother to act French, or like the poised
  rulers-in-training that their character were. The movie is so
  obviously a veichle for Dunst that it's sickening. There is just
  too much of her on the screen with not nearly enough reason for
  her to be there. Remember the 10 minute scene I described where
  she does nothing but smile? It keeps happening. It gets very,
  very old. It feels more like a photo shoot for Dunst than a film.
  I usually like Kirsten Dunst, but not in this film. Overall, the
  film looks and feels more like a music video and should have been
  one. There just isn't enough going on to warrent the film's
  length, and it's really geared towards young girls who love
  pretty dresses, food, and shopping, but have no taste for fact.
  It's a chick flick at it's worst, and it makes a mockery of the
  life of such an important person. It's very hard to believe that
  this came from the same person who wrote and directed films like
  "The Virgin Suicides" and "Lost in Translation"</Text>
  <Text category="music">This is an endurance test. As in 'bitches
  brew''live evil''love at the Fillmore' latter day Miles consists
  of moments of brilliance combined with long stretches of absolute
  tedium. It makes 'jack johnson' a real non event and considering
  the quality of musicians on board it is a real surprise. Take
  'yesternow' it takes for ever for Billy Cobham to find a beat.
  This is just self indulgence of the worse kind, a trait which
  unfortunately perpetrated a lot of the jazz fusion crossovers.
  Miles seems to want to create 'moods' and ends up with twenty
  minute plus of wallpaper music. This album is the complete nadir
  of his jazz crossover period. McGaughlin's guitar though
  breathtaking in the Mahavisuna orchestra here contents himself
  with silly little runs, totally without any structure and fire
  (this unfortunately was the same throughout his stay with Miles)
  Disjointed would be too kind a word. When you reliased that this
  was edited from long jams it makes you wonder how dull the
  unreleased parts were (i dread to even contemplate). Miles
  playing though usually inspired and lyrical here struggles to
  solo over the fast tempo's and is embarassingly weak. Maybe if i

  <Text category="music">Look, I dig stand up, and I dig fat jokes, but
  this guy isn't that great. I got a friend who loves John Pinette,

  over and over again. Its dull and it's too easy. They're not even
  jokes, really, just comments on how fat he is. Also a fair part
  of his act consists of "asian people talk with accents and thats
  funny" which I find cheap. Stereotypes shouldn't be jokes, and
  even when they are, they shouldn't be THE joke. John says
  something with broken english and the audience laughs really
  hard. Why? Why is that funny, here in the 20th century? Maybe I
  just don't "get" his humor, but I don't think this guy is any
  good. I perfer comedians who tell jokes. On the plus side, this
  guy is clean, which is rare these days. But there are better
  clean comedians around. Try getting a Brian Regan album or an Emo

  <Text category="book">This story should have and COULD HAVE been
  really good. It presents a great concept, but the story is just
  so poorly crafted. It is VERY sexist, the prose is stiff, and the
  plot is dull. I will concede that it was interesting at times; it
  kept me reading, but I really didn't get much out of it. I can
  only praise Heinlein for including the "intelligent conversation"
  which takes place after the press conference, where there is a
  great explantion on why the English language is so difficult to
  learn. The whole story is just very odd. Do read it though. It's
  a title to read if you wish to be considered "well read." Despite
  its faults, Valentine Michael Smith will be a character in
  literature that will never be forgotten, just as we will never
  forget Atticus from "To Kill A Mockingbird."</Text>
  <Text category="health">The reading magnifiers I ordered 09/29/04
  finally arrived 10/19/04 after a call to the seller. (Original
  order was shipped to Amazon.com so it had to be reshipped to me.)
  It only took 5 minutes or so to assemble one of the reading
  magnifiers, and it is possible to adjust it to just about any
  position with the clever arm. The weighted base does keep it from
  falling over. Unfortunately, the thin plastic lense is such poor
  quality that it is very difficult to receive any benefit from the
  device. If the user turned the adjustment knob too far, it and
  the nut that holds it together would fall off. The nut is small
  and must be inserted into the outside of the adjustment knob to
  assemble the device. The knob actually turns the nut onto the
  screw. Presumably the device is for someone with low vision. If
  the small nut falls to the floor, I'm not sure someone with low
  vision would be able to find it. My advice is to save your money
  and buy a quality device with a nice glass lens.... and if
  possible, try the device out before buying.</Text>

  Is Esther Williams such an unforgettable actress that the author

  overwhelming to forget that Miriam Hopkins had such an
  individuality in the acting process that she kept on working with
  such directors as Lubitsch, Wyler, Mamoulian, Hawks and Vidor to

  charger and it would take less time for the batteries to charge.
  I plugged them in and waited a few seconds. Both batteries had
  the flashing red indicating the batteries were either a wrong
  battery or bad. This will not charge the batteries for me. All it
  does is sit there and blink red. But the batteries charge just
  fine with the original charger. How can they be bad batteries if
  they hold a charge and we get hours of play out of them on a full
  charge. Funny that. Makes me wonder if it is a marketing ploy for
  people to run right out and buy a new $50 battery to replace the
  "bad" one. If it would actually work to charge the battery then
  it would be great. But we cannot get past the red light with
  ours. It is going right back to the store!!! It might be slower
  but we will stick with our original charger from now on.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">My husband and I are both history and
  literature buffs, so we were excited to watch this film when it
  was released to DVD. We aren't typically hard people to please,
  but this film was one of the most boring movies that I've seen to
  date. It's not that I don't appreciate artistic, visually
  stimulating movies - that have a point. Perhaps, assuming we all
  knew the story already, the director wanted to impress us with
  over two hours of lingering shots on grass, water, trees...and
  more trees. Apart from the lack of any foreword momentum
  whatsoever (though I will grant the last 45 minutes or so were
  interesting and possibly worth the slogging required to arrive
  there), this movie represents revisionist history at its worst.
  Here we are presented with an idyllic, practically un-fallen and
  un-corrupted view of the Noble Savage juxtaposed against the
  muddy, disgusting, conniving white man. Perhaps the writer forgot
  some of the more violent sides of some Native American life like
  scalping, or the less-than-environmentally-friendly act of
  running whole herds of buffalo off cliffs. It's fair to say, as
  the Post-Colonial talk goes, that Native Americans have been
  marginalized and misrepresented over the years. But by shifting
  to the other extreme, don't we fall prey to the same false
  stereotyping - just going the opposite direction</Text>

  <Text category="book">I was rather disappointed in Mr. Peterson's
  work. He dwells much too long on trying to convince us of
  &amp;amp;quot;the problem&amp;amp;quot;. Nearly the first half of
  the book is spent on statistic overload! Even after wading
  through the numbers and graphs, I am still skeptical of his
  conclusions and would caution readers to do further research.
  Certainly the Baby Boomers are an aging bulge in the population
  of the US and will create some challenges. However, the author
  fails to mention the &amp;amp;quot;echo boom&amp;amp;quot; (baby
  boomer's children which are equal in number) and he glosses over
  the impact of the huge young immigration population that comes
  into the country every year. Both of these facts will
  &amp;amp;quot;soften&amp;amp;quot; the impact of the
  &amp;amp;quot;Gray Doom&amp;amp;quot; that Mr. Peterson tries to
  create. I just don't anticipate the tremendous problem of which
  he tries to make us aware. But I did find interesting the
  apparently huge impact that abortions and birth control will have
  on our future. Another disappointment was very little discussion
  of aging trends and buying habits. Despite these shortcomings, I
  enjoyed parts of the book and it stimulated thinking about the
  future and the impact of aging populations</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I was very dissapointed with the product, it

  various sources, but I am afraid this is not worth the money. If

  forward a teeny bit and then stop. If anything, it senses when

  read the instructions and saw that the car does not work well in
  bright lighting conditions so we took it down to the dark

  <Text category="book">There are no doubt a few nuggets of wisdom in
  this book, but they are buried too deeply in bureaucratic
  gibberish to be worth digging up. This book has no bibliography,
  no index, mediocre footnotes, no serious useful conclusions or
  strategic summary, and a disturbing combination of
  American-centrism (on page 71: &amp;amp;quot;In the Asian
  continent....(t)he first driver will be the future U.S. role in
  Asia.&amp;amp;quot;) with a lack of intelligent presentation.
  There are exactly three figures and seven tables in this 336 page
  book, when there should have been at least 30 tables and figures
  illustrating specific sources of conflict in relation to specific
  countries. The World Conflict and Human Rights Map (8 pages of
  graphics and 8 pages of fine print) out of Leiden University does
  vastly more to inform than does this book. This book should
  never, ever have been published in its present form--I venture to
  say that if it were condensed to 150 pages and properly edited,
  with graphics and good synthesis, it might be worthy of a second
  look. Time is the most precious commodity in the world--RAND
  managers and editors need to get serious about how they present
  possibly useful information to experts who want to know what RAND
  thinks, but cannot spare the time to get past cumbersome
  undisiplined--even lazy--preparations. The topic of this book is
  extremely important--those who would invest their scarce time and
  money in doing research in this area deserve better from those
  who put together this book</Text>
  <Text category="book">After reading all the author's books so far, i
  realized he is repeating himself. In all his books (including the
  ones which Myron Bolitar isn't present) there are the same
  elements in the plot: disappeared person who might or not be
  dead, mobster guys who might or not be involved in the plot, the
  hero gets beaten by mosbter guys and is always saved "in the last
  minute", someone wealthy and with lots has interest in the plot
  but no one knows for sure. As the plots became being built upon
  the same structure, the suprise is getting less and less after
  each book. Being someone who started liking mistery books after
  reading all Agatha Christie's ones, and because each book of hers
  is completely diferent from the other, i look for the same
  originality in other mistery books. Of course the book is good
  for a first time Harlan Coben reader. I just didn't like it that
  much because of the repetitions, which make very easy to guess
  the final, spoiling the suspense of the reading</Text>

  <Text category="book">At the young age of 25 Julie Barenson loses
  her husband. Shortly after he dies, a great dane puppy is
  delivered to her home with a note from her late husband. This
  part will give you the chills ... nice touch. She names him
  Singer, and despite her frustrations with his size and clumsy
  mannerisms they grow to love each other. After a few years of
  trying to get her life back together after her tragic loss, Julie
  begins dating 2 men--Richard, a handsome charmer who wines
  &amp;amp; dines her, brings her lavish gifts and professes his
  undying love very early in the relationship. The other, Mike, is
  a simple down to earth country type whose idea of a date is a
  burger, Doritos &amp;amp; a couple beers at the local watering
  hole. So who would you choose? Ouch! I'll stop there with the
  comment that this could have been such a compelling story.
  Instead, we are faced with trite, boring, repetitive dialogue
  throughout, scatterings of viewpoint shifts and a very
  predictible plot. I cannot believe this is the same author who
  wrote The Notebook, one of my all time favorite novels. I'll have
  to admit the ending brought on a gush of tears. In conclusion,
  Singer not only saved his owner but the book as well.</Text>

  <Text category="health">I owned this set for about 2 and a half years
  before I finally just gave up and switched to a different brand
  of hot rollers (I used it about 4-5 times per year). First off,
  the rollers are very heavy so when you have them all in place, it
  feels like you are carrying a laundry basket on your head.
  Second, the rollers are hot to the touch so burning can be an
  issue when rolling up your hair. Third, the clips used to hold
  the rollers in place are fantastically difficult to use. I would
  roll up my hair (which would take like, 30 minutes because of the
  difficulty), and if I walked around the house to watch TV while I
  waited for my hair to set, the clips would spring out of place
  and shoot across the room. I eventually lost like 6 clips from
  the "springing out" thing. The results of these rollers were
  great, though. I used them on my wedding day and people loved it.
  Good results, but not worth the time and effort to use these
  rollers</Text>
  <Text category="book">Grudem seems to have a very distorted and
  confused vision of Christ. We can only hope that Evangelical
  become more like Christ. Jesus was the first real liberal and the
  most radical of liberals. If Jesus of Nazareth was anything, he
  was an extraordinary friend of the down- trodden, definitely a
  Liberal, whose advocacy on their behalf so infuriated the
  ultra-Conservative religious and political leaders of his day
  that they had him killed to prevent the public from hearing the
  very liberal teaching that you will see quoted abundantly in
  Jesus' own words on this web site ! Those who actually know what
  the Bible says about the life and teaching of Jesus recognize
  that far from being like Jesus of Nazareth, today's "Religious
  Right" are much more like the kind of clerics who battled this
  revolutionary prophet from the day he opened his mouth until the
  day they had him nailed to a cross. Although these people claim
  to represent Jesus Christ, they rarely quote his teaching or
  follow his example. What they do instead is use his name ("in
  vain") to promote their ideas, ideas which Jesus himself did not
  teach, and might well have opposed.</Text>
  <Text category="health">I began using Gillette's Mach 3 razor when it
  first came on the market, and was very happy with it (until
  recently...) The original Mach 3 would give consistently good,
  smooth shaves, and worked well for about six or seven times until
  it dulled and began to give rough shaves. That was an excellent
  product. However, with the introduction of the new Fusion razor,
  the Mach 3 suddenly became much less effective and the shaves I
  was getting were much rougher. I had heard about the Fusion and
  decided to try it instead, figuring may that Gillette was trying
  to "migrate" its users towards the Fusion by downgrading their
  reliable old product, putting all their new design juice behind
  the newer model. I was shocked by what a shoddy, difficult
  product the Fusion razor turned out to be. I went from getting
  several good shaves per razor to, well... none. I'm lucky with
  the Fusion to get two decent shaves per cartridge -- usually it
  roughs my skin up on the very first pass, and it doesn't cut my
  beard back right to the skin the way the Mach 3 used to. What's
  the deal? Did Gillette decide they no longer wanted to provide a
  quality product? That they'd rather have customers have to buy a
  new razor right away, rather than have us use the same cartridge
  a few times before needing to buy another one? If so, that marks
  a huge change in their corporate policy, from giving us a quality
  product to basically shoving customers around and trying to rip
  us off. I know they *can* make a great razor -- they used to --
  but if Gillette has decided to stop doing a good job, then forget
  it. So much for my customer loyalty. I'll either switch brands or
  stop shaving until there's another razor on the market that
  provides comparable quality to the old Mach 3</Text>

  the emphasis was on realistic martial arts. In the original, the
  main characters were trying to resist the influence of the West
  which was destroying their culture, but in this version, the main
  characters are actually on the side of the Westerners and they
  are fighting their own people! There is no explanation of why
  Wong Fei Hung and his crew would side with the people who were

  another fragment of their imagination, I suppose. This "business"
  book is more of a "romantic novel" about something relating to

  totally unsubstantiated, wanting us to "believe" that indeed,

  <Text category="book">This is a complex and detailed history chiefly
  of Cuban exiles in South Florida and the influence they have been

  Americans and Cubans. I have an objection, though, with the
  stone-hard style in which this volume is so meticulously, even
  gorgeously at times, written. Didion strives to be so achingly
  academic that there is little real heart to this book and, worse,
  the result is a cold, humorless, colorless story that is at times
  an unappealing example of ideological abstractions and alphabet

  <Text category="dvd">Damn. There's nothing remarkable about the
  second item on this DVD; it's your standard European-made

  the other hand, is reprehensible. It's a hodge-podge of vacation
  footage of Mansfield, clips from her movie project, and material
  entirely unrelated to Mansfield, linked only by the voiceover...
  and then, after an hour or so of light-hearted softcore
  buffoonery, the movie cuts to her death, spending the last twenty
  minutes obsessing on her husband and children and the large,
  mostly empty mansion she has left behind. This movie has the feel
  of something slapped together for the sole purpose of trading off
  a famous name after Mansfield's death. This is exploitation in
  its worst form. I found the sudden change in tone, the large
  volume of non-Mansfield material, and the sheer obsessiveness of
  the last twenty minutes disgusting in the extreme. Those looking
  for cheesy bad movies to enjoy, or softcore porn to tittilate, go

  <Text category="book">This book should get 0 stars; speaking as an
  artist myself, the theories laid out in this book are ridiculous.
  The basic gist of the argument seems to be that the work
  completed by the old masters was just too difficult to have been
  done without the use of optics, etc. To me it sounds like the
  desperate argument of a man who did not have either the talent or
  the determination to attain the skill of a great master, and
  therefore spent years constructing an elaborate excuse.
  Admittedly, I could not even finish this book; after reading for
  the nth time a line of shaky, circumstantial evidence like "all
  artists know that the ellipse of that collar is very difficult to
  draw, but there are no correction marks, therefore optics must
  have been used," I could not even stand to keep reading! On the
  contrary, all artists who have spent time and dilligent effort in
  becoming technically skilled know that although that ellipse may
  be difficult, after a few years of daily drawing and painting it
  becomes second nature, and could very well be drawn naturally
  with minimal correction. That is just one example... the book is
  filled with flaky examples such as those - Hockney claiming "this
  is too good to have been done without optics" or "this was too
  difficult to have been done without optics" - and I found myself
  thinking over and over that the man simply must not have been
  disciplined enough in his own art, if that is indeed what he
  thinks. And, modern artists must remember this: nowadays, the
  work of the old masters seems very difficult because in modern
  times artists get nothing like the education or practice time had
  by the old artists, for many reasons. Superior art education is
  very hard to find, and there are many distractions in the modern
  world (TV, computers, having to hold a 'day job', lack of
  patrons, etc.) and therefore modern artists usually lack
  discipline and do not live and breath art in quite the same way
  that the old masters did. Therefore, most will never attain the
  skill of the old masters. But that is certainly no reason to
  assume that the old masters could not have done what they did
  without the help of technology! Some of the other examples used
  as 'evidence' refer to 'odd' proportion, perspective, etc. in
  otherwise masterful work. I am surprised that this author (and
  those readers who are artists) apparently does not realize that
  throughout history, great artists did NOT necessarily strive for
  EXACT realism - even nowadays, photorealism is not necessarily
  considered great art by many artists, because after all we are
  ARTISTS not cameras! The point of realist art is to ACCENTUATE
  the reality, not to copy it! Therefore, many inconsistencies in
  proportion, perspective, etc. evident in old masters' work are
  not 'oddities' or 'mistakes', but purposeful exaggerations or
  adjustments to benefit the composition. All that being said, I
  think this book may even be harmful to the budding artist, since
  it may cast doubt in the mind of the art student that he or she
  can build the skill necessary to paint in a masterful way without
  the help of 'trickery' or technology of some sort. Instead, an
  art student should be encouraged to build skill, discipline, and
  self-reliance - because THAT is the true secret of the great
  masters</Text>

  <Text category="music">I remember really liking this album when it
  was first released, even though I could tell it was not in the
  same league as The Real Thing or Angel Dust. Listening to the
  album now, I realise it is by far the worst FNM album since Mike
  Patton joined. The whole album feels very rushed, it has a
  sparse, raw sound, very different to Angel Dust's polish. The
  music is generally very simple with many tracks sounding like
  B-sides and lacks the consistent melodiousness and sense of
  rhythm of their previous two classic albums. It was a shame to
  see guitarist Jim Martin depart. He had an unmistakable style and
  crunching guitar sound and was an integral part of FNM's style
  and make up. However, being replaced (for a short time anyway) by
  Trey Spruance is no bad thing - anyone familiar with his work
  with Mr Bungle will know he is a genius with a guitar and his
  work here on King For A Day is excellent, it's just a shame that
  the material he has to work with is largely uninspired. How
  ironic then that on such a disappointing album, FNM produce one
  of their greatest ever tracks - the title track is pure genius,
  full of the care and effort, rhythm and melodiousness FNM were
  famous for. Beginning with a great bass riff and acoustic strum,
  it is soon joined by a gentle female voice effect and simple
  minor piano scale and then brilliantly builds into a tour de
  force of percussion and guitar work before cleverly returning to
  the gentle acoustic sounds of the intro where it carefully takes
  2 and a half minutes to wind down beautifully - this is FNM as
  you'd expect them. Another track that deserves special mention is
  Cuckoo or Caca, a great metal piece with excellent percussion and
  keyboards and crazy vocals. It's scorching and funy and another
  reminder of the greatness FNM once held in abundance. It's just a
  shame that these moments of inspiration are surrounded by so much
  surprising blandness (Caralho Voador, Take This Bottle, The Last
  To Know) and 2nd rate metal (Ugly In The Morning, What A day, Get
  Out). Star A.D. could have been vintage FNM but in the end falls
  flat, Evidence starts off interestingly enough but soon gets
  boring and metal tracks like Ricochet, The Gentle Art Of Making
  enemies and Digging The Grave are simple and sound like what most
  student bands are writing. However, the album does end on another
  note of vintage FNM - Just A Man is funny and catchy with Patton
  having fun doing his Tom Jones impression and the inclusion of a
  gospel choir at the end is inspired - you find yourself not
  wanting it to end. Patton's vocals throughout the album are still
  amazing but should be accompanying much better material and you
  can't help but feel he was a little bored here - I think his
  heart always really lay with the far superior Mr Bungle, where he
  really shone and where his voice was absolutely perfect for the
  complex and avant garde material. I suppose it's not surprising
  that King For A Day is a largely empty affair, the departure of
  Jim Martin and the diminished presence of Roddy Bottum at
  rehearsals meant that FNM's original chemistry and resources were
  sadly lacking and so were unable to achieve what they once had
  been able to. It's really an album for Faith No More fans, it's
  certainly no classic despite some classic material and I feel it
  was the beginning of the end for FNM, they would improve with
  their next album, Album Of The Year - but only marginally.</Text>

  <Text category="book">This is definitely NOT one of my favorite
  books about stocks. The title of the book is a little deceiving,
  the author talks a lot about option instead of stocks and half
  the book is about stock splits. Chapters 1-4 are about general
  info, such as you must buy and sell to make money, don't hold for
  a long time. You must research the stock before purchase, EPS
  must increase every year. I didn't find anything in those
  chapters that I didn't already know. Chapters 5-10 is all about
  stock splits and when to purchase the stock as well as when to
  sell. Once again, the author talks about the obvious; buy when
  you hear that stock is splitting and sell after the split before
  the after split dip. Chapter 11 gets into more advanced trading
  techniques, the bull put spread. This is not something that I use
  or will use in my trading. Chapter 12 is the concluding

  <Text category="music">Eric Reed is a monster pianist. Under the
  right circumstances, he could record a Christmas album that would
  become an instant classic. This, however, is an unfortunate
  example of what happens when an overconfident artist tries to do
  everything himself. Reed produced and arranged this album
  himself. Probably if he had hired an objective producer, that
  producer would have told him to hire an arranger. Reed's
  arrangements are second-rate. His version of "Santa Claus Is
  Coming To Town" has been downshifted into a parody that serves as
  the worst example of an annoying trend: Reed attempts to put a
  fresh twist on nearly every song. It's an admirable goal, but he
  doesn't have what it takes; and the result is like a restaurant
  that serves hamburgers with a knife and fork, and swordfish
  crumbled over salad. It just doesn't work. I hope this isn't the
  last Christmas album from Eric Reed. He's one of the truly
  original voices of his generation; and with his gospel background
  and feel for the blues, there's no doubt in my mind he could
  record an album that would rival "A Charlie Brown Christmas." But
  this isn't it. He needs to hand over the reins of his next
  project and focus on the piano</Text>

  <Text category="book">This book was required reading for a class on
  children's literature. So, naturally, I was expecting the very

  we share good finds to read together in the evening. We were
  about 75% of the way through before its magic halted and it
  turned to various detailed descriptions of the main character's
  female body parts. Due to this we feel it falls short as an
  example of wholesome children's literature. We set the book down
  and did not finish it. If you are looking for good children's
  literature that COMPLETELY steers clear of naked images instead
  of turning to them to keep the pace of the book going, then this
  book will be a let down. Sad, because up until that point, the

  <Text category="book">Having read Detective Comics #471-479 in the
  70s done by this same creative team, I picked this up, hoping for
  more of the same. What a let-down! I have to ask - What
  Happened!? The art on those erstwhile 70s issues was the finest,
  most detailed art I'd ever seen in a comic-book. I think that was
  due mostly to the inking of Terry Austin. When he was working on
  X-Men, he gave John Bryne's pencils that fine detail as well. Has
  Austin done a 'Gil Kane' and given up his nib-and-ink to work
  with marker-pen? This Dark Detective series shows none of the
  fine-ness of his previous work. You only have to compare the
  'flash-backs' of this series to the original Detective Comics
  issues to see that something is wrong. Maybe Austin or Rogers are
  getting older, but the artwork is very basic, and lacks the sheen
  they used to produce. The art sometimes actually reminded me of
  Bob Kane's early work. The story also is a little unbelievable.
  It portrays Bruce as a love-sick puppy and just doesn't ring
  true. Also, the lettering is - well, it's been hand-done, by
  Rogers I surmise, and is quite uneven. It should have been done
  by computer. I'm sorry - I SO wanted to like this, but it's
  nothing like the calibre of work that this creative team produced
  in their glory days of the 70s.</Text>

  <Text category="book">Yet another historical novel into which a lot
  of research and work was clearly put, but the result is
  dissatisfying largely because the author doesn't know how to
  write. My single biggest objection to this book is the constant
  and annoying use of the author's alternative grammatical rules.
  Comma splices and run-on sentences are not, and never will be,
  acceptable to me. Occasional use can be overlooked, but Shaara
  peppers every page with them, tacking four or five or more
  predicates on to the same subject. The effect is so glaringly
  obvious that it becomes difficult to continue reading. The
  following example is made-up, but it is a good imitation of how
  Shaara writes: "He turned in the saddle, rode toward his
  headquarters over the ridge, refused to look back toward the man
  receding in the distance, focused instead on the day ahead,
  forced himself to confront the bigger problems at hand." One
  often finds whole paragraphs composed of several run-on sentences
  in a row like this. The result is a book that reads like a rough
  draft, or maybe not even that; it reads like a collection of
  notes preparatory to writing a rough draft. I don't understand
  how authors get away with publishing such half-finished work, and
  I don't understand why readers put up with it. Another problem is
  the lack of convincing characterization. Everyone is vaguely
  noble here, with the exception of a few complete cads. Washington
  loves his wife and longs for peace and home. Cornwallis loves his
  wife and longs for peace and home. Greene loves his wife and
  longs for peace and home. I think you get the picture. Few
  characters stand out on their own. Even Lafayette is just another
  young officer. The author assumes that we already carry our own
  perceptions about the major characters and will plug them in at
  the start of the book. And Shaara's attempts at making his
  characters witty never work. The result is a cast of characters
  that is tedious and dull. Beyond that, I'm doubtful about the
  author's device of switching focus among the various characters
  in each chapter. It's fine when we leap across the Atlantic and
  jump into Franklin's mind. But the rest of the time, it doesn't
  work well. I find that I sometimes have to flip back to the start
  of the chapter to remind myself who has the focus. Either I'm a
  lazy reader (and I'm not), or the device isn't working well. In
  addition, this device constrains the author to keep the narrative
  focused almost entirely on Franklin in France, and Washington,
  Green, Cornwallis and Howe in America. That means that we get
  only glimmers of the happenings in Parliament and the royal court
  in England, and the continental congress in America. In effect,
  this novel is really about Washington's military camp and Howe's
  dinner table, which makes the narrative unbalanced. Some aspects
  of the story are interesting. I enjoy reading about Washington's
  maneuvers, and the repeated frustration at coming up with an
  empty bag and finding that the British have eluded him. I learned
  a fair amount about just where the various forces were, and when.
  But I wish now that I'd just bought a decent beginner's history

  <Text category="book">I loved the earlier Nevada Barr mysteries,
  with their depiction of national parks and natural dangers. I
  wasn't as happy with some of her latest efforts, but still hadn't
  given up on her. Now I'm not so sure. This latest novel started
  off well enough although the idea of two severely traumatized
  girls should have been a clue as to what would follow. The idea
  that they were from a polygamous Mormon sect was a red herring.
  Perhaps it was Barr's attempt to show us how these girls were
  abused even before they met evil incarnate. The scenes where Anna
  realizes who the real villian is and her interaction with him and
  the poor tortured third traumatized girl went on for over 60
  pages. Each scene was more disturbing the one before it. I found
  myself skimming the pages and still am not sure how she resolved
  all the loose ends. But I have absolutely no desire to re-read
  the end of the book and find out. I wish I could say that I would
  read another Nevada Barr novel because I so thoroughly enjoyed
  the first ones. But after reading this disturbing, somewhat
  convoluted story, I would think twice. If I did pick up another
  Anna Pigeon novel, I'd make sure I had something else to read if
  the story took another dark turn. I would certainly not stick
  with it to the end.</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">As the US European Command A-2 (Director of
  Air Intelligence) during this phase of the disintegration of
  Yugoslavia, I was surprised to see the ending -- what happened to
  the admiral and pilot. Historical? No way! The only plane shot
  down was a single-seat US Air Force F-16 pioted by Capt McBrien
  (sp?) while on combat air patrol (CAP), no cameras. Some naval
  F-14s carried film-loaded cameras in pods, but most of the
  imagery pin-pointing mass graves came from U-2s and satellites
  (and good coordination with French peacekeepers on the ground).
  So, this movie was fiction. It could have conveyed a better
  message, a better review of the decay of the former Yugoslavia
  and the dominant role of Serbian forces. But the producers
  decided action via fiction was better than learning fact</Text>

  Lonestar, Martina McBride, Montgomery Gentry, Aaron Tippin, Lee
  Greenwood, Neal McCoy, Kenny Rogers, Randy Travis, Phil Vassar,

  Charlie Daniels Band, David Ball, and Blackhawk. What do these
  artists have in common? Cutting edge musical geniuses? Gifted
  songwriters able to speak to a wide range of audiences?
  Innovators in their genre? Err, no. Actually what they all have
  in common is that they all appear on this package, created to
  commercially exploit the war on terrorism, one which contains
  songs like Where The Stars And Stripes And The Eagle Fly, This
  Ain't No Rag, It's A Flag, and Back Where I Come From. In other
  words, maudlin, xenophobic, cliche filled, black/white
  dichotomous sentiments, and the lack of any attempt at rational
  or questioning political analysis, all set to fiddles and pedal
  steel guitars, and to be marketed and sold at Wal-Mart. I should
  add that I am not against patriotism, when it is intelligent and
  well informed; this, however, is dumb, reactionary
  faux-patriotism. Nothing is more so than the song God Bless the
  USA. As an American who loves his country, I can say that this
  song, with its syrupy sound and its naive lyrics, does not speak
  for me. I listened to a bit of this schlock on a plane ride a
  while back just to see how much of it I could take. The answer
  was - not very much. What little I could take made me want to
  drink, and heavily. Some of these performers, specifically Brooks

  Chesney and even (I hate to admit) Toby Keith are actually fairly
  talented; others, like former lounge singer Lee Greenwood,
  Alabama, Montgomery Gentry, etc, are 3rd rate musical hacks.
  Ultimately, listening to this nonsense, I'm reminded that some of
  the greats of the genre, like Johnny Cash, Hank Williams, George
  Jones, and Willie Nelson were neither knee-jerk reactionaries nor
  apologists for a ruling political party. Then again, Dusty Drake,
  Montgomery Gentry, and Blackhawk are no Johnny Cashes. Just
  Nashville hacks, soon to be forgotten.</Text>

  boys had not played rough with it, it just wasn't the quality
  that I had hoped for. It is a real favorite of theirs, I am just

  <Text category="book">Casual book browsers who stumble across
  Braden's book, "The Isaiah Effect," might undoubtedly be drawn to
  the implications of the title: that there exists some mystical,
  unifying code which is only now being fully understood through
  modern techniques, research, and understanding. I, as one such
  browser, had briefly read about the so-called "Bible Code" which
  computers have now enabled man to explore and thought that the
  subject of this book might be related. With my interest piqued at
  the title and the book description, I delved into the pages
  expecting to learn exactly what encompassed Isaiah's "precise
  instructions" of prayer. I wanted to know exactly what Braden
  claimed to have stumbled upon. What I found in this 250 page
  foray into countless subjects was nothing other than a pastiche
  of new-thought concepts. The mixing of religions, for example - a
  sort of pick-and-choose spirituality which has slowly been
  creeping its way into the mainstream for decades - is recycled
  over and over again, drawing from endless sources of gnostic
  gospels and other lost books. In only one chapter does Braden
  actually begin to describe in detail verses from the book of
  Isaiah. Instead he relegates the books of the Essenes to
  positions of higher authority and prominence. In the brief pages
  in which Braden actually does discuss Isaiah, his conclusions
  speak nothing of a decoded lost science. His basic premise of
  "The Effect" is that people can alter their futures by the
  choices they make in the present. Such a revelation is not a new
  interpretation of Isaiah at all. Any student of the Bible and
  Christianity knows that all the prophetic books of the Old
  Testament are records of God warning Israel, and the world, of
  turning away from Him. To Braden's credit, his discussions of the
  effects of prayer in today's society are commemorable, albeit
  somewhat misguided. I agree with him that people in today's
  society need to turn away from the petty details of life with
  which they've surrounded themselves. However, I believe Braden
  over-emphasizes the role of feelings and emotion in prayer. He
  fails to discuss how humans, and their emotions, are extremly
  fallable and can change as quickly as the winds in his anecdotes.
  Braden wants desperately to believe that the true power of prayer
  is to be found in all the lost science which he has uncovered in
  ancient texts. In the process he fails to recognize that the
  blueprint for prayer has been known to man ever since he was
  created. Humbleness before God and the filling of the Holy Spirit
  are the true keys to prayer - not cosmic emotions and human
  feelings. A disappointing read</Text>

  NOWHERE TO RUN, but if this book was written by James Brown or if
  he even had much to tell the writer, I'll eat my refrigerator. It
  is so full of errors that it is laughable. One of the most
  glaring errors was when Mr. Brown 'supposedly' said, "SAY IT LOUD
  was where funk started" or something to that effect. That is so
  ridiculous. James Brown would NEVER say such a thing! Any student
  of funk knows that COLD SWEAT was the quintessentional funk piece
  and it is not even mentioned in the book!!! The style of Mr.
  Brown's sentences that are attributed to him sound NOTHING like
  him. I have no idea why this was put out. The other
  'autobiography' written over a decade ago was more relevent and
  much better written, THE GODFATHER OF SOUL by JB and Bruce

  <Text category="dvd">Weird, whacked out interpretation of Lewis
  Carroll's Alice in Wonderland that combines live-action with some
  stop-action animation to create a creeped out dreamscape. White
  rabbit is a sawdust-stuffed real rabbit that escaped from the
  taxidermy stand, caterpillar is an old stocking with dentures and
  glass eyes, Mad Hatter is a marionette and March Hare is a
  wind-up stuffed toy rabbit with a loose button eye. Devoted Alice
  fans may have a different reaction, but I found Jan Svankmajer's
  Alice disturbing and, at times, tedious. Everyday objects - the
  stuff in Alice's room - become the stuff of the dream. Playing
  cards become Red Queen and entourage, the White Rabbit has a
  nasty looking set of incisors and a distressing tendency to shed
  his sawdust guts, Alice herself becomes her own blank-faced doll.
  There's no law that says Alice has to be bright and cuddly, but
  it sure helps. Whether intentional or not, Svankmajer's Alice is
  grim and nightmarish. Svankmajer animates figures in motion- real
  figures, like dolls and stuffed and mounted rabbits and such -
  but he doesn't animate facial expressions. Combine that with the
  flat tone of voice by the film's narrator - ALICE is narrated by
  the actress who plays Alice, dubbed into English, or course - and
  the film has a flat, dead feeling. The film, oddly enough for an
  animated feature, is leadenly paced. Some scenes seem to run on
  forever. The tea party with the Mad Hatter (a marionette) and the
  March Hare (a bedraggled plush toy bunny with an annoyingly
  ill-attached button eye) runs on and on, the animation repeating
  itself way past our limit of patience. The Mad Hatter wants a new
  cup of tea (`Change chairs!'), the March Hare scoots around in a
  wheelchair. The new seats are taken, the tea is poured, the Mad
  Hatter wants a news cup of tea (`Change chair!') and on, and on,
  and on. Sheesh - thought that scene would never end. Look - I'm
  not that big a fan of Carroll's Alice stories in the first place,
  but the movie adaptations of his stories - be they Disney's
  animated movie or the 1933 full-length feature with Ned Sparks as
  the Catepillar and Sterling Holloway as the frog - all have had
  something going for them. Comedy, for one thing. Svankmajer's
  inspiration is laudable, but his execution is often
  disappointing. His Alice is dark, grim, humorless and not
  everyone's cup of chai. It's like listening to a quiet sonata
  played by an acid jazz band - it's familiar enough, probably good
  enough for the converted, but hard for the uninitiated to embrace
  and unlikely to win any new fans.</Text>

  Birthdays did, or a half of a page as Relationship did, this book

  up the destiny of those born in each of the 48 personology

  <Text category="music">Kate Bush's second album, "Lionheart", may be
  the weakest in her catalog. Its clear Bush did not want to fall

  instead reaches in a number of different directions, some
  successful, some less so. Musically, the album takes stabs at
  ballads similar to the first record ("In Search of Peter Pan",
  "In the Warm Room"), a more pop structure ("Wow"), rhythmic
  shifts ("Don't Put Your Foot on the Heartbrake") an almost
  shuffle ("Fullhouse") and a gret rock song ("Hammer Horror").
  Lyrically, Bush has added a level of sensuality to her work
  ("Symphony in Blue") and shows no sign of shying away from
  controversial subjects ("Kashka from Baghdad"). The problem is
  that it doesn't hang together well to my mind-- admittedly, my
  rating for the album is in many ways relative to Bush's other
  work, no album with the absolutelyu amazing "Kashka from Baghdad"
  can be all that bad, and certainly "Symphony in Blue" is strong
  enough to stop you in your tracks, but the album just doesn't
  work for me. For early Bush, try her debut ("The Kick Inside") or

  <Text category="dvd">"Rip It Off" is not an easy film to watch. In
  short, it is dull and meanders from plot line to plot line,
  leaving only the most attentive viewer (read: myself) to guess at
  what was going to happen next. But not in a good way. Judging
  from its drab look and unimaginatively shot scenes, not to
  mention a script whose dialogue borders on the absurd, it never
  ceases to amaze me how it managed to attract such well-known and
  talented personalities as Alyson Hannigan and Jennifer Esposito.
  It begs the question: WHY DID YOU DO THIS FILM? Or, on a personal
  note, why did I BUY this film, especially at $22 and change?
  Frankly, I bought it because of Alyson Hannigan: she's gorgeous,
  obviously intelligent, and the girl can act. Individually
  speaking, she does not disappoint here. It's obvious that she
  really didn't want to sleep walk through her role as Lexi, and
  she gives the other actors a lot of material to work with.
  Although the silly musical leitmotifs seem deliberately crafted
  to undermine her scenes, she is a singularly interesting actor to
  watch, and her performance simply wants me to see her do more,
  preferably a more mature and fully fleshed out character in a
  serious film (see Jennifer Aniston in her brave performance in
  "The Good Girl.")But enough gushing: if Ms. Hannigan had not been
  as engaged, I would have trashed her soundly. Most everyone else
  in "Rip It Off" (with the possible exception of the fellow who
  plays Sergei with operatic relish) is more or less "phoning it
  in" when they do their scenes. This made me lack any kind of
  sympathy for them in addition to making me sleepy. Also, films of
  such low production value should come with a printed warning of
  some sort: BEWARE! DO NOT ADJUST YOUR SCREEN; THE APPEARANCE OF
  THE FILM IS INHERENTLY BAD. "Rip It Off" and films of its ilk
  give independent filmmaking a black eye. I've seen black and
  white student films with greater intrigue and atmosphere than
  this turkey. And, contrary to the technical description of the
  DVD, IT IS PRESENTED IN THE HORROR THAT IS FULL SCREEN, AND NOT
  WIDESCREEN. Can you believe people invest money in these films?

  lesson is something everyone can appreciate. Great Book</Text>
  <Text category="music">I purchased this CD shortly after finding out
  that Nickel Creek would be disolving their union as a band. I
  hoped that this collection would be suitable for both myself (as
  a strong supporter of Nickel Creek) and my two children. This CD
  honestly fails to deliver a suitable substitution for the music
  that Nickel Creek produced over the past 7 years. Although, I
  guess that was an unrealistic expectation to have for this CD.
  You have to keep in mind that the members of Nickel Creek were
  just children themselves when they released this CD. I don't
  believe that they had found their true musical identity, and they
  obviously wouldn't have reached their full musical potential yet.
  This CD isn't really the best for a todler either, so I have to
  say that this purchase was a let down overall</Text>

  <Text category="health">Ok I picked up a corded Vidal Sassoon
  hairclipper at Target. The thing was so absolutely horrible that
  I had to come to Amazon to vent about it. The blades seemed
  blunt, if not nonexistent. It would only cut little tufts of
  hair, and the hair had to be taut, literally held by my fingers.
  It literally tried to rip the hair out of my head. My follicles
  still hurt from the hour or so I spent trying to shave my head
  with this terrible clipper. Most of the hair I actually
  successfully removed, was due to scissors. Lubrication and blade
  adjustment with the screwdriver had no effect--the blades weren't
  *stuck*, they just *suck.* I don't care how much money Vidal
  Sassoon spends trying to portray themselves as the trendy cutting
  edge in fashion maintenance--judging from this horrible
  experience, they really, really do not know how to make a decent
  hairclipper. I have shaved my head plenty of times over the last
  few decades, and I have seen some bad clippers, but never have I
  experienced a clipper that was so bad that it would probably be
  bested by a haircut given by a sharpened stone instead.</Text>
  <Text category="book">Alright, for those of you who say Rand is
  criticizing works for false ideals, or lacking in substance, I
  say this: who is Rand to say what the absolute greatest ideals
  are? Who is Rand to say what substance is? You've got to look at
  her bias, first. Realize that Rand never takes into account
  anything not related to personal freedom. As if outside factors
  never matter; and maybe they don't, for her. Maybe her life in an
  oppressive Russia did nothing to form who she is today. But I
  doubt it. Though I believe personal choice plays a huge factor in
  determining who we are and how we live, outside influences do
  affect a person. But she doesn't. Thus she condemns all works
  that are not driven solely by the individual as crap. All books
  that are not driven solely by the individual's sense of reason:
  don't read, cause it will lessen your IQ. Any work that portrays
  or is driven by an emotion she doesn't find worthwhile or cannot
  understand, she condemns. Rand, at least as portrayed in what
  I've read of her work, is unfeeling toward anything but what she
  wants. And this is carried over into this book in what she
  criticizes. They cannot hold a little or a fairly large amount of
  quality, they are either good or worthless. The pieces of art she
  says are empty ARE empty, absolutely. They don't fit into her
  paradigm thus have nothing to offer. Nothing to offer her, that
  is. How is a completely selfish person supposed to write a
  critique of history's best books, telling OTHER people (with
  different wants and ideas and all the other funtions of an
  individual) What they should read? Truthfully any criticism in
  this form, like a list I saw detailing the 100 best literary
  works in the world, is elitist crap trying to close people's
  minds toward books that a certain group deems lesser than others.
  They have their bias like anyone else. I say read in variety.
  Observe art outside of Rand's choice of art. Take in all you can,
  with an open mind, then start pondering whether you agree or not.
  If you then agree because YOU agree, then I say great. Its the
  basic individualistic response that Rand seems to forget to
  address. She says question society, but by my line of inquiry.
  She says be an individual, but only I know the basis of who you
  want to be</Text>

  <Text category="toys_games">I bought this game hoping to have another
  great game for my girlfriend and I (we became bored playing
  backgammon all the time) and we are disappointed. This game has
  nothing to do with any lost cities.... it's just a card game that
  requires you to stack cards in numeric order to get points... you
  group the cards by color (which are supposed to represent
  cities????) and eventually the game ends after a certain number
  of cards are played and you tally up a bunch of numbers, divide
  that by pi, and then take the square root of you birth year and
  multiply that by five to see if you have either earned points or
  need to subtract them. Then you do the math for your partner. We
  tried to play it a few times and it was just kinda dumb.... (The
  points arn't that difficult really!), but this game was a waste
  of time and twenty some odd dollars. I suggest you take the $20
  and buy a bottle of hooch, and have some real fun with your
  partner... unless you are 8 years old... in which case this game
  might be fun. Just Terrible</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I really didn't enjoy the movie, but I had to
  finish it. The hypocrisy of Faith and her sidekicks mirrored so
  many of the so-called fundamentalist that I know, but the
  ignorance and hopelessness of the others were terrifying. This
  movie presented a very perverted view of Christianity. Though
  there was alot of talking about Jesus and saying His name, it was
  clear that no one in the entire movie actually KNEW HIM and spent
  time with Him. When Mary gets a revelation from something she
  believes is Christ that opposed the actual Word of God, she finds
  someone who is crazier than the average nut to confirm her
  decision. Christ does not tell anyone to do things that goes
  against His Word. No one actually reads a Bible in the movie.
  Consequently, most made many life-damaging decisions. I hated the
  "reality" of the movie, but it has challenged me to actually
  spend time with Christ and learn about Him. I shudder to think
  that I could live long enough to present such a twisted veiw of
  what Christianity truly is.</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">With the greatest respect to the incredible
  Bob Beldon, Joe Zawinul, and Wayne Shorter, this Box Set should
  contain a warning. The warning is simple: If you already own most
  of the stuff in this collection, don't bother. If you're
  completely new to Weather Report, buy it. Coming from someone
  that's seen the band perform every year since 1972 and own all
  their official and quite a few "other" releases, I was really
  disappointed with this project (except for the booklet). Here are
  a few things that are puzzling: 1) A Weather Report Box Set
  includes three songs (two composed by Zawinul and one by Shorter)
  that were never released by Weather Report: a. In a Silent Way.
  released by Miles Davis b. Super Nova, released by Wayne Shorter
  c. Experience in E (Excerpt), released by Cannonball Adderly (I
  agree with the liner notes that point to these songs as
  pre-cursors, but mentioning them would have been enough - they
  are all in print) 2) An incredible typo stating that Alphonse
  Mouzon was the drummer on "Unknown Soldier" 3) Including a barely
  improved version of Nubian Sundance that has been in circulation
  for many years from "other" sources. 4) Including another "better
  than, but not by much" version of the "other" sources for the
  1978 Rockpalast concert on DVD. 5) Not remastering any of the
  original recordings. The tape hiss from the Live in Tokyo (I Sing
  the Body Electric) songs is still clearly heard and not upgrading
  those old recordings is just plain unacceptable in this day and
  age. 6) Finally, the cover itself - I have no words, except to
  admit "I don't get it". Having said all that negative stuff -
  Weather Report remains the dominant "creative machine" of the
  Jazz Rock Fusion era and those that missed it should buy this
  without hesitating. If you're a long time Weather Report fan -
  there's absolutely nothing to get excited about here. The DVD was
  especially disappointing to me. I have had that concert on VHS
  tape for many years and now on DVD (all from "other" sources) and
  was shocked to see such incredible video noise on the official
  version. Zawinul's black and white keys look like polka-dots in
  many places. (I played the DVD in 5 different players; two TV's
  and my computer monitor to make sure it wasn't my equipment). I
  should have paid attention to the PR person at Sony that told me
  the concert was taken from a re-broadcast of the show and NOT
  from the master tapes. It's my own fault for having unrealistic
  expectations. I should probably clarify that while the DVD is in
  fact clearly better than the "un-offical" version, IT STILL LOOKS
  LIKE A BOOTLEG! Sad... It is of some significance that this
  "review" is the first time I've chosen to speak out about
  something in Fusion that was less than flattering. It should also
  be noted that my disappointment is aimed directly at CBS/Sony/BMG
  and not the musicians/producers. I'm still amazed that this
  record company can see fit to release this and hold back the
  already remastered Mahavishnu Orchestra Live in Cleveland Cd that
  was supposed to be released in 2004. Lastly, let me make it
  perfectly clear that Zawinul, Shorter, and Beldon are musicians
  and people I personally hold in the highest esteem with Zawinul
  and Shorter being musical divinities as far as I'm concerned.
  While my review is an obvious personal venting, and I realize
  that Zawinul and Shorter gave this project their stamp of
  approval, I think that shouldn't be mistaken for a personal
  attack. My remarks are simply observations with some attitude
  directed at CBS/Sony/BMG. By Rick Calic Jazz Rock World</Text>

  <Text category="music">To much guitar, drowns out all the other
  instruments. Survivor was made famous by heavy keyboards and
  drums, not guitars. I was expecting another Burning Heart, Is

  The vocals by Jamison are top notch, but none of the songs sound
  like the Survivor I remember. Survivor guitars were only there to
  complement the keyboards, bass and drums, not drive the whole
  song. I guess Jim Peterik was the man behind Survivor all along.
  I give the CD 2 stars for Fire makes Steel, the rest are throw
  aways. ***Recommended for die hards only*** I highly recommend
  'When Seconds Count' for anyone getting started with

  <Text category="music">As a lover of gospel bluegrass I anticipated
  an enjoyable listening session with Blue Highway's latest
  offering. Let me first say that I am a fan of this group, which I
  consider to be one of the premier groups in bluegrassdom, but
  what I heard was bluegrass Muzak. Yes, the group's tight
  harmonies and excellent musicianship were in evidence, and that
  is what saved this disc from being sold to the local reseller,
  but the lack of inspiration and excitement was disappointing.
  Gospel music, even bluegrass Gospel, has a tendency to
  preachiness and taking itself too seriously as this disc proves.
  A good Gospel recording MUST have some cuts which are humorous,
  some serious and contemplative, some that push the envelope of
  orthodoxy, and most importantly it must have an element of FUN in
  order to keep the attention of the listeners. This disc fails in
  that regard containing standard old Gospel chestnuts along with
  some original songs that ape the oldtime standards. My advice is
  to either borrow it from a friend before buying new, or buy used.

  <Text category="dvd">Before I saw this movie I thought I would
  enjoy it. I enjoyed watching the miniseries when I was a kid.
  However, nothing could prepare me for what I was about to watch
  on screen. It was an absolute disaster of a film. I do enjoy
  superhero movies, some recent ones I like are the Spiderman
  series and Batman. But the Hulk did not inspire me at all, it was
  like going to the Dentist to get a tooth pulled. The character is
  a cartoon-like green figure, totally lacking in his emotional
  capacities, not even his rage convinced me, it looked like a
  video game more than a movie. This film had no serious plot
  worthy of mention. It was just plain painful to watch. If I could

  <Text category="music">I don't see the comparison to Jeff Buckley AT

  while and, if you remember London Suede, has a very similar sound
  to them (though I will say that London Suede was MUCH better). No
  one has come close to the pipes of J. Buckley (or even Tim B.,
  for that matter) in years and this doesn't count any where near
  that, either</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This was a very annoying and boring flick
  thats barely watchable and throughout the film I kept looking at
  my watch, the film is not a historical drama nor is it an
  autobiographical film about William Shakespreare infact it is a
  romantic comedy disguised as a historical drama. My girlfriend
  insisted that we watch this film together but I wasn't in the
  mood she forced me to watch this, the film was about a struggling
  young writer Shakespeare played by Joseph Fiennes who falls in
  love with Lady Viola played by Gwyneth Paltro who also happens to
  inspire his famous play Romeo and Juliet, this film also won a
  couple of oscars including Gwyny for best actress but I felt like
  the film was just not that funny because all the characters
  seemed to talk in an old English style thats hard to understand.
  Overall the film was just O.K. I think that some of the sets and
  costumes were fantastic and Judi Dench was great as Queen
  Elizabeth but I never want to watch this film again, if your a
  Shakspeare fan and like romantic comedies then you might like
  this film more than I did.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I couldn't agree more about this product. It's
  appalling how badly made it is. The concept is very cute - a
  toolbox that unfolds into bridges and roads for the small
  die-cast vehicles. My 2.5 year-old has a hard enough time dealing
  with frustration without this toy adding to it! The bridge on the
  right doesn't properly attach or stay up and the road pieces do
  not attach properly. It's also a battle to get the tool box to
  connect together. My son always wants to play with it, but I
  can't cope with his cries of frustration when it all falls apart.
  I think this toy will have to mysteriously "disappear" one night
  while he is sleeping. They should withdraw this rubbish from the

  <Text category="health">When the internal rechargable battery dies so
  does the unit. The power cord will not power the shaver once the
  battery can no longer hold a charge. You cannot replace the
  regargable battery yourself! Sending the unit for factory repair
  after its warranty will cost you more than buying a new one. As
  for the shave: not bad, but not exceptional either. The cutters a
  very tiny, not built to last, and are not durable. All
  rechargable batteries have a limited life depening on conditions
  on how they are used. This shaver may last you a few months - a
  year, 2 to 3 years will be a stretch. I also have a braun and a
  norelco, the norelco is 10years old and running fine, the braun
  is 15 years - both have original cutters and foil - I heavy duty
  clean them in 97% alchohol about once a year, and brush out
  debris about once every 7 uses, these units dont have batteries
  and this is why I purchased the remington to have acess when
  there is no power plug available. The Remington shaver really
  needs to have it's cutter blades cleaned (brushed off or washed)
  after every use (what a Pain)! I find this shaver to be a waste
  of money as it is more akin to being a disposable electric shaver
  - than one that will last</Text>
  <Text category="health">This shaver only works on short or fine hair.

  <Text category="music">Amazingly this compilation has managed to get
  together some of the most untallented performances of Brahms'
  music. With a few exceptions the moto of this CD can be summed up
  as 'no understanding and appreciation for a musical genius'. The

  pieces that could have served better the bedtime purpose. Buy at
  your own risk. My only fear is that some people will get their

  <Text category="toys_games">This looks like such a great toy, and the
  packaging is really impressive, but don't be fooled like we were.
  I assumed that by paying close to 25 dollars it would be somewhat
  durable-just reasonable durability-I don't expect much from
  plastic toys...but this is really really bad. You might also
  think that paying that much would give you things like closable
  doors...you know, 99 cent matchbox cars' doors stay closed, but
  the space shuttle's doors don't-which limit it's "fun" factor.
  The "movable arm" is just a free floating plastic stick that
  simply is stuck into a hole..It doesn't even stay in. The "launch
  pad" and the fuel tank/boosters are down right horrible. They
  don't connect to the shuttle, which was disapointed all of us,
  especially my son. And it is so cheaply made, I really can't
  believe that it wasn't bought from the dollar store. My son was

  were illuminating and contributed to the educational value of the
  book. My professor was able to bring Dr. Schrag to talk to our

  reinforces negative stereotypes of gay men as nasty effeminate
  queens who are not to be taken serioulsy. Sadly it's been
  embraced by the same pandering gay men who think drag queens are
  'camp' and therefore funny, indicative of how off the mark they
  are of what defines camp (go read Susan Sontag boys) and how low

  targeting female gentilia, and a secondary racist commentary
  about Thai women 'entrapping' Aussie men Trashy and not in a good

  <Text category="music">It seems that even the best bands have only a
  finite number of great melodies in them, and the Flower Kings
  exhausted theirs in their first four cds. Here we have yet
  another double-helping of their ageless wisdom, strewn across two
  cds to our fiduciary detriment. Though not as crass and offensive
  as Stolt's "Wall Street Voodoo" or Bodin's "I AM", this is
  nevertheless lyrically naive to the level of silliness. There are
  a few good instrumental passages mixed in this release, but not
  enough to justify its purchase. Stolt said in a recent interview
  something to the effect that "...peace &amp;amp; love never go
  out of fashion..." Well, neither does informed maturity, and you
  won't find any of that in this group's recent output. Just more
  utopian preaching and good vs. evil typecasting. Their liner
  notes advocate sending money to Greenpeace and Amnesty
  International, but I would counter that any American would be
  better investing their extra cash at St. Jude's Children's

  probably several more Flower Kings cds, to do just that. There

  <Text category="dvd">I've always been a fan of Roger Moore's James
  Bond, but what I've discovered in recent years is that only a
  couple of his Bond movies were, like, actually good. "The Spy Who
  Loved Me" is not one of them. Oh, sure, it's fun -- almost ALL of
  the Bond flicks are fun -- but it's basically just a kid's movie,
  and that's not necessarily a good thing. (1) Stromberg is a lame
  villain. Yes, his underwater lair is well-designed, but it's
  silly. Not as silly as that ice palace in "Die Another Day," but
  pretty silly. (2) Barbara Bach is one of the very worst Bond
  girls. She's not an ugly woman, to be sure, but she was a
  terrible actress; she sounds like she's reading -- poorly -- from
  a cue card in ever single scene she's in. (3) Jaws is a stupid
  character. Having metal teeth wouldn't actually make you capable
  of biting through metal. The metal you were biting would resist,
  and you'd end up just tearing up your gums. I don't expect
  realism from 007 movies, but I also expect them to not be
  outright idiotic. (That said, Jaws is effectively used, and
  Richard Kiel was excellent in the role.) (4) The disco score is
  terrible. TERRIBLE. (5) The plot is nothing more than a rehash of
  "you Only Live Twice," but on the ocean rather than in space.
  Certain elements of the big final shootout are even the same in
  both movies! Embarrassing. I love Bond, but this is not one of
  the highlights. The DVD is good, with a couple of fine
  documentaries, but the commentary track grates, because the
  director and other commentators spend WAY too much time patting
  themselves on the back for the great job they supposedly did.
  Even if that were true, it'd be annoying</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">Let me begin by listing all the great things
  about the movie. 1. It is incredibly beautiful animation 2. The
  music is amazing 3. I happen to like how the movie is darker than
  the tv series The Things I don't like about the movie: 1. The
  characters are not developed at all 2. You get the feeling your
  only skimming the surface, like a starving person being tost a
  crumb of bread 3. It almost seems that every seen in the movie
  was stopped half way through the writting process. Ok you may
  have see that I gave this moive a 2 out of 5, well that is
  becuase of the story line and plot.The story line of any movie is
  much more important to me than the animation. The movie left me
  with a odd emptiness from begining to end. I just kept thinking
  there has to be more. But there wasn't. The best way I could
  describe it would be to say it was as if the movie were a lost
  child at the carnival that no matter how hard it looked it just
  couldn't find its parents. This movie is for the person who likes
  action and no character development fluff. But if you are the
  person who likes well developed characters and story line please
  don't buy it rent it first. I'm not saying its a bad movie by any
  means, just a bit empty for me.Just one more thing the Escaflowne
  series is very very good don't let any bad reviews of the movie
  discurage you from getting the series</Text>

  <Text category="health">I couldn't send this item back quickly enough.
  I presumed by its price being 2 to 3 times that of other foot

  NEVER PRESUME! With a low powered hair dryer mounted in the

  uncontrolably. I'd say about twice as much energy was disbursed
  out the feet of the unit to my hardwood floor than to my feet.
  I'm not someone with unreasonable expectactions as many of the
  reviewers I've read seem to have. This is just an unusable
  product. The materials look cheaper in person, it offers
  virtually no "massage" to the foot, and it is incredibly loud.
  There is no redeeming quality to this item. Before I bought it, I
  looked all over the web for a review, unable to find one.

  <Text category="toys_games">My husband and I have ignored many poor
  reviews in choosing toys for our 18-month old and have often been
  pleasantly surprised to see our son thoroughly enjoying such
  toys. Unfortunately, this was not the case with the Peg Perego
  Thomas Ride-On train. He is exceptionally tall and strong for his
  age, yet there is no way his hand could possibly depress the
  button required to keep the train moving, much less hold it down
  for any length of time. So the operation of the train requires an
  adult to depress the button and spin in circles while your child
  bats your hand away and is totally distracted from the
  experience. My son enjoys pushing the train along the track more
  than riding it. However, the train is flimsy and easily comes off
  the track, so this usually lasts a few seconds before he is again
  frustrated and annoyed. All this and then you need to get out the
  screwdriver to charge the battery every time you "play" with it.
  Don't buy this toy or you will be kicking yourselves like we are.
  It's a gimmicky piece of plastic junk that even major
  Thomas-lovers will probably not enjoy.</Text>
  <Text category="music">Greatest Hits collections of rap artists are
  usually a pretty bad idea. Most good rappers pack a visceral
  punch on first impact, but this wears thin with repeated
  listenings. This is especially true of gangsta rap. With what
  allegedly should represent the best work of B-T-H on one disk,
  this collection falls on its face trying to get around itself.
  Arranged back to back, the rapid-fire syncopated delivery that
  constitutes virtually every track on this collection wears thin.
  The raps blur together, and after two songs, the obscenity-laced
  machine-gun vocal play loses its novelty value, sounding more
  like a stylized novelty than any type of artistic vision. Once
  the raps lose their ability to hold your attention, all that
  remains are the rhythm tracks, which are serviceable at best.
  Their biggest hit, "Tha Crossroads", appears here in a version
  that is completely unrecognizable from its better-known form,
  further reducing the value of this collection. Worse, they
  include a warmed-over version of "F- Tha Police", an exercise in
  futility that only serves to dissipate the power of NWA's
  original. Spending money on this collection is like buying old
  newspaper articles. It might have had some value when it first
  hit the stands, but who wants yesterday's papers? C Tom

  <Text category="toys_games">My son is 5yrs old and this was one of the 1st

  but when we finally opened this and I tried to put it
  together...I thought I was doing it wrong b/c nothing fit or
  stayed together!! My son still played with the dragon part that
  was already put together but the storage bin is useless and the
  rope that the Power Ranger can "slide" down is barely high enough
  that he stays off of the ground and he pretty much falls down
  rather than sliding down. The so called "instructions" were
  horrible and another reviewer was correct in indicating how small
  the pictures were. I would have never wasted my money on this if
  I would have read the reviews 1st (I usually do). My son played
  with it for about 5-10 minutes and then asked why santa would
  bring him something like that. In my opinion it was a huge waste

  <Text category="music">My youngest brother, who has a pretty strange

  album cover in rainbow-painted panties while licking a
  heart-shaped lolli-pop? And the foldout poster of her reclining
  on pink satin sheets with said lolli-pop is downright laughable.
  Does she expect anyone to take her seriously? After her first
  album, I thought Carey had a remarkable talent that needed some
  fine-tuning, particularly in regard to her penchant for singing
  cliches. Instead of getting better, though, she has turned her
  career into a self-debasing fantasy of baby-doll mannerisms
  coupled with relentlessly monotonous song choices. Rappers like
  Jay-Z, Snoop Dogg, Missy Elliott and Usher are brought in to add
  spice, but they only drown in the sticky-sweet syrup of gunk that
  she chooses to sing. She may have a lot of #1 hits, but who can
  tell any of them apart? Rainbow is only Carey's latest entry in a
  career that has lowered the quality standard for divas
  everywhere. D- Tom Rya</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">We bought this for my son for Christmas, on

  with freshly treated water and a prayer, we put the fish in. The
  next day it was very listless and lying along the bottom. After
  checking the reviews, I saw one where the person removed the fish
  and they recovered. So we've taken the beta out and are waiting
  to see if it will survive. I still would rate this aquarium 1

  <Text category="book">The novel, A Northern Light, by Jennifer
  Donnelly, is a very realistic portrayal of the life of a teenage
  farm girl, bound for a great future. Jennifer Donnelly relates to
  Mattie Gokey, the lead character, in a way that they bother grew
  up in rural side of New York. Donnelly attended the University of
  Rochester before she wrote her three novels and one children's
  book. Her novels include, The Tea Rose, The Winter Rose, A
  Northern Light, and a children's book, Humble Pie. All of her
  novels include a very popular romantic theme and her book, A
  Northern Light, has also been introduced in Europe under the
  title A Gathering Light. A Northern Light reflects a lot on the
  issues of wealth, education, love, and murder. The combination of
  those themes makes for a novel that anyone is able to read and
  relate to. As you read this book, you feel like the main message
  is the traditional clichï¿½ of following your
  dreams no matter how hard they are to achieve. But as you read
  further, you realize that it's a lot about hardships, strength
  and love. On the first page of the book, Mattie is imagining a
  perfect day at the Glenmore hotel before she so disappointingly
  tells herself, "I believe these things. With all my heart. For I
  am good at telling myself lies". From this quote, you can see the
  type of person Mattie is, and it gives a foreshadowing to the
  events that would take place throughout the novel. The events
  typically consist of let down after let down for Mattie and her
  hopes for her future. This book is written from Mattie's point of
  view which really helps the reader to get to know her better. It
  adds a different element to the book that wouldn't be there if it
  wasn't written from Mattie's point of view. It lets you get
  inside Mattie's head and feel the emotions that she's dealing
  with along with her true thoughts and feeling towards situations.
  Mattie is truly troubled girl who works so hard toward what she
  wants and yet there is always something holding her back. She's
  stuck in a farming town where education isn't as important as
  having a prosperous farm and a family. As you read this book, you
  just want to tell Mattie that she needs to take her own future
  into consideration and stop worrying long enough to have some
  faith. She is a selfless giver who is willing to do anything and
  everything to keep her family and her farm doing well. She deals
  with extreme guilt for wanting to leave her father after her
  mother died. She has to learn that the promise that she made to
  her mother to always take care of her family includes taking care
  of herself as well. Royal Loomis enters Mattie's life at a very
  unconventional time when Mattie's unsure of what she wants to
  become and she has to chose between his love and the life she's
  always wanted. Mattie deals with her teacher, Miss Wilcox,
  leaving town. Miss Wilcox was Mattie's role model who was living
  the life of an independent poet with a car and a royal lifestyle.
  The life Mattie wants. This book is intended for a female
  audience because it deals with issues that sometime only a girl
  could understand. It's a fairly easy read so it is more for
  adolescents than adults but not for young children. The issues
  that it deals with are issues that children may not be able to
  appreciate as much as teenagers who are about to go to college
  and leave their families. A Northern Light is full of valuable
  lessons, but most of all it's just a good book to get lost
  in.</Text>

  <Text category="book">This has to be one of the worst written books
  I ever read. I can't believe there are so many ways to say the
  same thing. So far, Danielle Steel has found a way in the first
  third of this book. I just can't read the rest of it. Generally,
  if a book isn't very good I can suffer through. This one has
  gotten on my last nerve. I had stopped reading her books because
  they had become so predictable. But, I don't think I will be
  reading anymore of her books. It's an insult to Nora Roberts and
  Sandra Brown for her to be ranked with them</Text>
  <Text category="health">I got this product to help me sleep and it did
  NOT work for me. I used to take some pain killer/sleep aid made
  by Members Mark and that worked great, but I no longer need the
  pain killer. I bought this and have tried it 3 times now, and I
  can't quite explain it but it did not make me tired. It made me
  feel relaxed and more of a false tired, plus it made my sleepless
  leg syndrome act up all three times I used it. Not only did it
  not make me drowsy, I couldn't sleep and I woke up several times
  during the night. I think I would have done better without it.

  <Text category="toys_games">I purchased two of these hand held Deal or No
  Deal games for my two 8 year old twin boys. The boys found that
  they had trouble indicating that they'd like to "Take the Deal".
  When the pressed the button to say "Yes" to the deal, the game
  continued as if they said "No Deal". They got annoyed, but kept
  on playing. I tried the game, thinking that they did something
  wrong, but I also had the same problem. I'm annoyed because the
  game was $20 each and I think it doesn't work properly!</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">We finally bought these Barbie Magic of the
  Rainbow dolls for our 4-year-old twin daughters after hearing
  them beg for it repeatedly after each time the commercial aired.
  At first, they were very excited to play with them. Positives:
  The doll is durable. It encourages participants to follow
  instructions. Negatives: I notice my daughters have to wave the
  doll a few times before the DVD "hears" the instructions.
  Positives: The DVD provides clear and easy to understand
  directions, so your doll can be programmed with your remote
  control. Negatives: The doll set off our fire alarm a few times
  before we figured out it was the doll (and we did check to see if
  there really was a fire!) When the DVD is not in, the dolls
  control the volume on the TV! This can be very annoying when the
  volume increases just as you realize your daughters have started
  playing with the dolls. My suggestion: de-program the doll when
  your kids are finished playing the DVD! Or, just keep it
  deprogrammed and use your remote -taking all control away from
  your kids and keeping them from standing so close to the
  TV</Text>

  constantly putting the legs back on and setting it back up and
  placing it with my daughters lil corner of little mommy

  one with the most problems. we do have a variety of brands
  varying in price from cheaper to more expensive. this one is by
  far the worst product we have yet purchased for her collection.
  we have very few dolls that actually fit in the swing and the
  ones that do, are too small for it. it is also the smallest item
  my daughter has for her dolls that range in size. we will not
  purchase another of these as well as recommend others to not
  purchase one. if the price is too good to be true, then you will

  been a bit of a disappointment. She would sit on it and rock for
  a few seconds at first but would quickly lose interest. Now that
  we have had the eggplant for 3 months, it has been completely
  shoved aside. It just doesn't rock much. I can't imagine a child
  over 1 wanting to play with it. The eggplant has very little
  curve to it and is pretty boring. I would stick to the Little
  Tikes set.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This was the word used by one reviewer, and it
  just about sums up the film. Another reviewer hit the nail on the
  head by saying that many young wannabe creative persons start off
  with highly auto-biographical and introspective pieces of work.
  Usually these are binned, as the person matures. Asia seems to
  have the advantage of a parental environment sufficiently
  indulgent and well-heeled to let her have her way on film,
  instead of on scraps of paper like the great majority. But good
  art is more than self-expression, self-promotion, self-pity and
  self-indulgence. It should have a satisfying underlying form, say
  something new to its audience, expose some as yet unperceived
  truth about life and humanity. Art is boring if it merely tells
  us something we already know, especially if it's told in a
  semi-familiar way. Most of what Asia says in this film we do
  already know, if we are half-aware of what goes on around us.
  Still, the girl has a cute face, and she's put a lot of effort
  into this performance. Something more may come with time.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">OK, so most of the reviews I read for this
  film said how great it was, well I for one think those opinions
  are based on the fact that young men and some women who enjoyed
  it mainly thrived on the sight of seeing Angelina's breasts. The
  acting was poor, the script was stupid, and the sets were lame. I
  have seen some pretty bad movies in my time (ie Killer Kondom)
  but this one took the cake.. I would watch tromavision flicks
  over this one ANY day. save your money. If you want to see a good
  sci fi type movie watch ones that have been in the box office for
  more than a week ;</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">If you love well written stories, great plots
  and captivating acting then this movie IS NOT for you. I don't
  know how the producer managed to swindle precious investor
  dollars to get this tripe made into a movie, however there it is!
  It was SO BORING and so badly done that after the first 1 hour
  and 45 minutes I had to turn it off. I don't even want to know
  how it ended. The cast line up was great! That's the only
  'positive' comment I can make with regards to this movie. DO NOT
  watch it. DO NOT hire it. DO NOT believe anybody who thinks it is
  good. The two lesbians who made love even did that scene poorly;
  get this, it was done in the missionary position! Avoid this
  movie</Text>

  <Text category="toys_games">I bought this doll for my daughter for
  christmas and she was so excited, however in the last three days
  I have found that this doll was not worth the price. The paint on
  the lips has already worn off, the eye lashes are falling out and
  it is difficult to keep the face clean, no matter how many times
  a day we wash it. It has also stopped drinking when the bottle is
  placed into it's mouth. I know of several other girls that are
  friends of my daughter who are having the same diffculties as we
  are. If my daughter didn't love this doll some much I would
  return it for something worth it. I guess if you are just
  intrested in making your child happy this is a good product
  however for the money I would suggest something else.</Text>
  <Text category="book">I agree with a number of previous reviewers.
  Grimassi stretches a poor understanding of historical context to
  fit into what he bounces between
  &amp;amp;quot;wicca&amp;amp;quot; and
  &amp;amp;quot;witchcraft&amp;amp;quot;. Wicca is not an old
  religion, indeed it is not much of a religion at all. It has
  always lacked definite theology (what is the saying about ask
  three wiccans what they believe and you'll get four answers...)
  and Grimassi does more damage than good by presenting historical
  materials is non-scholarly lights. In fact, the book is poor on
  all accounts. From confused terminology to
  &amp;amp;quot;chopping&amp;amp;quot; of source materials. This is
  a waste of money</Text>

  for some english beer they're trying to market in the states.
  that song (if you can call a random string of cheesy choruses a

  a song that makes any sense or follows any consistent theme.

  <Text category="toys_games">I bought this for my pony-obsessed daughter

  Thank goodness I wasn't expecting much out of this toy after
  reading reviews on the other playsets, because it didn't even
  last a day! After I assembled the "braiding" handle and my
  daughter quickly learned how to operate it herself, she came out
  not an hour later in tears because it had fallen apart. Not the
  handle you snap on, mind you. That was still firmly attatched.
  The rest of the mechanism had more or less disintegrated as she
  used it! Fortunately she gets enough use out of Zipzee and
  Daffidaisy that it wasn't too much of a loss that I had to throw
  it away only hours after opening the box. So, unless you're
  really after Zipzee or Daffidaisy, don't waste your money on this
  junky thing that could potentially be a choking hazaard for
  younger siblings. Horrible!!</Text>

  <Text category="music">I had high hopes for this cd. I love norwegian
  metal, and I love viking stuff so I thought this would be great.
  I was at least hoping it would be good. What I heard was a bunch
  of uninspired, mediocre, a dime a dozen metal songs. I mean there
  is enough good to save it from being a total waste, but not
  enough to give it even 3 stars. The high points are The fate of
  Norns, The persuit of Vikings, and Arson. These songs are bad @$$
  and fun to listen too. An Ancient Sign Of Coming Storm 5.5 just
  mediocre Where Death Seems To Dwell 5.5 very repetitive The Fate
  Of Norns 7 This one is pretty good. It has a repetitive punchy
  opening riff that gets stuck in your head long after listening to
  it. The Pursuit Of Vikings 7.5 This is my favorite song from this
  cd. Pretty Bad A$$. Valkyries Ride 5.5 Tedious Monotony The
  Beheading Of A King 5.5 Same as Valkryies Arson 7.5 A bit of a
  slow starter but it picks up towards the end with some melodic
  guitar Once Sealed In Blood 5.5 a bit faster than some but still
  a downer. All in all nothing horrible, and there is some good
  songs. The music is a little on the simple side which doesnt
  necasarily make it bad. I like a lot of simpler music like
  Darkthrone and Burzum. The problem is that when it comes to
  simpler stuff I like it to have some really good aptmosphere.
  That is precisly what is lacking here. I will still listen to it
  occasionally hoping that it will grow.</Text>
  <Text category="health">...and it wasn't worth having to send it back.
  Seriously. I thought maybe it was the batteries, so I switched

  another reviewer smelled burnt plastic when the unit was in use,
  it's my guess that something melted/warped in the mechanism. I
  will give the manufacturer a bit of credit since this item did
  perform nicely the one time I was able to use it, so I'll call it
  a 10 dollar pedicure and call it a wash. I have a makeup mirror

  <Text category="music">Cheap Trick's second album is very
  disappointing to me after the good, but raw, "Live In The

  here is so watered down that it REALLY COMES OFF WAY BETTER on
  the later many Live disks they did. After a good start w/ "Hello
  There", a concert favorite for many years, is the only thing here
  to write home about when one considers how great all the tunes
  from this overproduced album sounded on the Budokan and other
  Live recordings later. Tom Werman and Rick Niesen were on a show
  in 1991 that I had recorded on a tape once and Werman, noce a
  friend of Tom Petersson's said, quote: "My three albums with
  Cheap Trick got better and better...", to which the ever
  sarcastic Rick Nielsen said, "Selling, maybe." Not realizing that
  brother Rick was slamming him, Werman then continued,
  "Exactly"... Oh boy. We now see why producing Cheap Trick albums
  through the years has become like playing Russian Roulette. It's
  not hard to get better than this and five months later the solid,
  but somewhat oeverrated 'Heaven Tonight' came out...(And the guys
  EVEN bought Werman back for Dream Police. Things turned out
  better when Pete Comita, then later Jon Brant joined the band.

  <Text category="music">A tenor very quickly on the rise, this is
  Villazon's second recital disc, one devoted to arias by Gounod
  and Massenet, all in sets of three, three for Massenet, and two
  for Gounod. While still showing great promise, some concerns that
  were mildly serious with the first disc are even more so, in the
  French repertoire, in part because diction comes up so short
  here. "O souverain" from Le Cid continues to show Villazon's
  command of line and squeezed but adequately forceful upper
  register, so that the volume boosts from the control room are
  really unnecessary. Diction here is already an issue, as many `u'
  vowels get dipthonged, especially when Villazon's sound is placed
  back for added weight and volume. `La reve' from Massenet's Manon
  is comfortably floated, with support from Natalie Dessay as Manon
  enhancing the intimacy of feeling to this number. Would Villazon
  been able to sing the short aria by Alain (who appears to the
  heroine at first to perhaps be little more than an apparition -
  shades of Frau ohne schatten perhaps? - in almost a chamber
  opera), from Massenet's Griselidis (track 8), at least as softly
  and lightly, as both the music and dramatic situation require,
  this could have also been very successful. He instead turns the
  ABA shape of this mere chanson inside out and makes a wreck of
  it. The less often excerpted "Lorsque enfant" from Werther closes
  out the first Massenet set, as does "Pourquoi me reveiller" the
  second. Villazon's identification with the distraught main
  character of this opera is abundantly clear in both. He
  capitalizes well on the quixotic emotions and dreamy tendencies
  of the distraught main character especially well in the first
  selection, and he is also less intruded upon by the producers or
  sound engineers there as well. It is quite curious how the
  control room follows the tenor up a crescendo on a line that
  closes out the first section of the excerpt here from Massenet's
  Roi de Lahore, featuring a hero (from Hindu myth) that bound to
  certain stipulations, has literally returned from the dead. Not
  quite as ostentatious as Massenet's near remake of Lohengrin,
  Esclarmonde (but with female protagonist instead), it is one of
  Massenet's most colorful scores. It has only been recorded
  complete once commercially, with Joan Sutherland, Luis Lima, and
  appearing only ten minutes apart, James Morris, and for the part
  of General unfortunately eliminated from this scene here, John
  Tomlinson, along with one other cut to Villazon's part. It
  would've been more valuable to have all this complete instead of
  one or two other arias. He captures the incipiently worried tone
  of Alim well, but his coloring up the vowel sounds makes it seem
  that he has come from a place as remote from French culture as
  where the opera takes place. Most successful of the Gounod
  selections are two of the three rarities. The first is Source
  delicieuse from Polyeucte, based on the Corneille play. It opens
  very well with a minute of orchestral cortege. It perhaps has
  only been recorded once before and well, by Roberto Alagna ten
  years ago; Villazon conveys the heroism of the piece somewhat
  well, if not as securely as Alagna. Anges du paradis from
  Mireille (which Mirella Freni championed and recorded complete
  for EMI), is third, perhaps a study for Ah leve toi, soleil
  (Romeo), several years down the road. The second Gounod rarity on
  this disc is "Inspirez-moi, race divine," said to be a Caruso
  favorite, from Reine de Saba. Its text indicates King Solomon's
  prize hired builder, Adoniram, to be a very confident, if mildly
  haughty chap. Villazon's interpretation seems to portray a hero
  that constantly has to look behind his back, with all the
  incipiently yet controllably vibrato ridden throb and
  backphrasing Villazon engages in here. The high C at the end,
  however, is convincing. Such device as in the above, also accents
  and colors most phrasing in the tomb scene from Romeo et
  Juliette. "Ah! leve toi soleil" opens the first Gounod set, and
  is sung with the right ardor, conventionally marked by tiny
  captured scoops, coming off phrases. Villazon's entrance and two
  later lines catch for having placed so far back in the throat,
  and intonation gets momentarily derailed. "Salut, demeure" from
  Gounod's Faust quickly becomes expressively leaden and
  monochrome. Recitative and the beginning of the aria, "Ah! fuyez"
  from Manon begin well nuanced enough, and for the aria, truly
  softly as a change from so much else on this disc, but
  all-purpose bench pressing and volume boosts intrude before long.
  That leaves two truly atmospheric selections from two Massenet
  rarities, to close this recital - first, an aria from Roma,
  Massenet's swan song for the lyric theater and "Ah! parais" from
  Le Mage, opera with plot line similar to that of Verdi's Aida,
  following. The melody, introduced by the cellos at the outset for
  the latter, somewhat takes after "Pays merveilleux" from
  Meyerbeer's Africaine, but in more voluptuous color, such as in
  Thais, and Villazon and Pido both capitalize well on its
  opulence. Pido's work, on numerous other numbers on this disc,
  seems heavy, lumbering, cloying, or just simply out of his idiom,
  so to speak. Word has it that Villazon, while not having a big
  voice, is dramatically exciting on stage and probably more
  immediately engaged with the content of what he is singing. How
  this picked up a major award from Gramophone, for the specific
  problems this disc has, and over two more qualified nominations
  (Ciofi/Di Donato Handel Duets and a Florez album) is mystifying.
  So much digression here is over the very specific demands that
  French opera makes on singers. There's much reason for hope for
  this tenor, but this disc, for two-thirds of it, does little to
  help fulfill it</Text>

  <Text category="music">I really really really really like Allison
  Moorer. Have been a fan since her first record, have road-tripped
  to see her numerous times, and love her songwriting and singing.
  That said -- "Getting Somewhere" is by far the least satisfying
  of her records. No memorable songs. Over-produced. No "guts", as
  another reviewer said. When the Allison Moorer/Doyle "Butch"
  Primm songwriting team called it quits (in more ways than one),
  their Lennon/McCartney-caliber teamwork was lost. Not that Moorer
  sounds like The Beatles, but Allison and Butch complemented each
  other well when composing music. This CD is not only unmemorable
  but I doubt I would care to ever listen to it again. Such a
  shame. I've never had anything negative to say about Allison in
  the 8 years I've been a fan. But this CD left me cold. It hurts a
  bit to say this, but I cannot recommend this CD. The closest
  analogy I can think of that relates to how different this CD is
  from her earlier work is the B-story line from an episode of "The
  Larry Sanders Show". In that episode, Sanders' head writer Phil
  (played by Wallace Langham) finally got himself a girlfriend and
  was happy. As a result he lost his edge. When he was a miserable
  person he was an edgy, cynical, funny jokewriter. When he was a
  happy person he stopped being the kind of funny that he needed to
  be to do his job. Same with Moorer. Since her recent changes in
  her social life she has started "singing a sweeter tune" in her
  life, but it came with a cost. She doesn't seem to be the same
  songwriter anymore and it was that "other" songwriter who was so
  good -- a little edgy, sad, sometimes bitter, or at least that's
  how I interpreted it. Granted, that wasn't her entire oeuvre, but
  it is what made her songs special for me. Now she's happy and she
  might as well be writing songs for Barney the Dinosaur</Text>
  <Text category="book">Thriller and mystery readers like to guess
  along with our protagonists when we're reading a story. We like
  to look for clues in what we've read to help us unravel the plot,
  and find out who did it and why the crime was done. John Grisham
  cheats us out of that fun. The villian of this book isn't
  introduced until there less than 75 pages left, which means that
  when you get that far, you realize that everything you read
  before then wasn't valid. To have some red herrings in a thriller
  is fine, but to have 300 pages of chases and red herrings? That's
  bad. Read another thriller instead of this one, one that plays by
  the rules</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I had not realized what great performers
  Michael Flatley, Colin Dunne and Jean Butler were until I watched
  this version of Riverdance. The lead dancers in this version are
  not in the same league and much of the performance is sloppy
  compared to previous versions. What made Riverdance great for me
  was the precision, timing, and dancers dancing togeather in the
  Irish dance numbers. It is all gone here. Try "Riverdance: Live
  from New York City" or the video tape "Riverdance: The Show"
  instead. This version should not have been released</Text>
  <Text category="music">After souring to dizzying heights with their
  first four albums (a feat achieved by only a handful of bands)
  the inevitable fall seems to have come on this disc. The Bunnymen
  built their reputation on moody, psychedelic concept pieces that
  culminated in Ocean Rain. For this release the band moves into
  more 'mainstream' territory, eschewing album-wide cohesiveness
  for a more radio friendly approach. Unfortunately these
  lightweight songs don't work as well as the tantalizingly obscure
  sound they abandoned. If you're new to the Bunnymen you're
  probably better served by checking out their first four albums
  (Crocodiles, Heaven Up Here, Porcupine and Ocean Rain) or
  skipping forward to their more recent efforts Evergreen and
  Flowers</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">With The Straight Story, Lynch demonstrated
  none of the recognizable trademarks that transformed him into the
  director that I love. This film felt like a "blind date" gone
  bad. The Straight Story showed up, David Lynch arrived, but the
  rest of the date felt muddled, confusing, and utterly disastrous.
  Everything in this film seemed wrong. Lynch's choice for lead
  actor, the bland Sissy Spacek, the filler of repeat cornfield
  montages, all the way to the incoherent time spent on the read, I
  just felt that nobody had control over this picture, yet the
  randomness (and the possible tear ending) gave critics something
  to smile about. This is not a David Lynch film, and for those
  walking into this with images of Mulholland Drive, Twin Peaks, or
  even Eraserhead in their mind will be utterly discombobulated.
  The Straight Story attempted to show us a slice of Americana via
  the cornfields of Iowa, but for this boy based in the Flatlands
  of Illinois, it just seemed repetitive and boring. What initially
  pulled me away from this film was the technique that Lynch used
  to introduce us to Alvin and his daughter Rose. Alvin lying on
  the ground because he can't get up, the clichï¿½
  use of taking him to the doctor letting us know that he is
  deteriorating, while bringing us the central conflict of his
  brother falling ill was just too much in such a little time
  frame. Spacek's depiction of Rose seemed unbalanced and rather
  stale. She brought nothing fresh to this rather emotional
  character outside of a stutter and some unfunny scenes. I
  expected so much more from Spacek with her timeline of cinema,
  but this felt like something she did on an afternoon instead of
  providing us with the intensity that she harbors. Then, to add
  more fuel to the fire, there was Richard Farnsworth. Again, he
  isn't a horrible actor, but it felt like Lynch picked him because
  he fit the role physically, but alas, couldn't master it
  mentally. Farnsworth seemed out in left field for a majority of
  his time onscreen. I couldn't tell if he was trying to remember
  his lines or if he was truly in character. His eyes seemed watery
  for everything which brought too much emotion to those little
  scenes, and seemed to bring not enough by the dramatic ending.
  His entire speech about his time overseas at war was pathetic,
  while some will quote it as being his speech of a lifetime, I saw
  it as babble (and no, I am not that insensitive - I just felt it
  could have been handled by a stronger, more professional actor).
  The rest of the cast seemed equally as unimportant. I wanted
  Lynch to either go 100% for this film or none at all, but alas,
  it felt as if he just half-ed his way through this heap. Speaking
  of David Lynch, where did he go in this film? There were some
  scenes that I witnessed that screamed the director that I love,
  but then there were others that just felt like he took pointers
  from Ken Burns' "Looking at America" class. I hated the sweeping
  cornfields that seem to plague this film. Instead of keeping us
  by Alvin's side throughout his journey, Lynch gave us a
  repetitive view of farming and corn. There is nothing wrong with
  this technique when making the epic that one desperately needs to
  see once in a while, but when the same images were used over and
  over again, I nearly felt Lynch was humoring us with the dulls of
  Iowa instead of being the majestic all the critics raved about. I
  think he could have been stronger with his filler than what he
  was with this film. He needed something to couple with the
  authenticity of Alvin, but the stock-footage that he chose to
  show was definitely not the balance one could hope for. I also
  felt there was more to be discussed with the friends that he met
  along the way. Alvin was a walking storybook, filled with the way
  that he led his own life instead of listening to those around him
  and learning from their experiences as well. Lynch made Alvin
  very closed minded, which did not create a strong protagonist for
  the feature. Alvin was a strong character, but I needed more with
  this story. I wanted him to make choices, learn new things, and
  bring that to his brother's table when they eventually met. I
  felt cheated when this never occurred and felt as if Lynch was
  saying that this journey through Americana was that we could
  learn from Alvin, and not vice-versa. Overall, I wasn't stunned
  by this picture. I thought Lynch could have been stronger with
  his choice of direction and cast instead of what seemed like he
  just "played it safe". The overplayed stock footage of cornfields
  infuriated me due to the lack of time that we could have been
  spending with Alvin. Speaking of Alvin, why couldn't he have been
  a stronger, better-rounded character? I felt after watching this
  film that Lynch had duped me into believing that he wanted to
  paint a picture of America, but instead gave us nothing more than
  soft music, recycled images, and stock characters. The stories
  were interesting to listen to, but brought nothing fresh to the
  table. I must admit that the brotherly love moment brought a tear
  to my eye (since I have a brother as well), but why couldn't we
  focus on this further. Lynch made the riff between the two
  brothers seem like a toss in the pan, when it was the central
  focus of this film. The Straight Story could have been a strong
  tale bringing in a new image for Lynch, but instead it felt
  jagged and old. I could suggest one viewing for this film, any
  further, and you will see how dull those cornfields really claim
  to be! Grade: ** out of ****</Text>
  <Text category="book">My mother bought this for me for Christmas.
  She used the "available new and used" section to get it a little
  cheaper. She ended up paying $160 or so. When I put this on my
  wish list I thought that this hardcover version would be the
  Arabic-English/English-Arabic, considering that it was $175 and
  the paperback of the Arabic-English only was available for $45.
  As it turns out, this is only the hardcover of the Arabic-English
  only. So for one, my mother paid an additional $115 for only the
  hardcover version of a book that I could have gotten in the
  paperback for $45. I still do not have the English-Arabic of the

  <Text category="toys_games">I hate Monopoly, but loved the idea of making
  my own game board. Sadly, MYOO had so many limitations! I gave it
  a higher ED rating because you can turn the game into an
  educational one, but it isn't intrisically educational. It
  doesn't print out spaces with color bars, just little green
  squares that you glue on the board below the pre-printed color
  bars. The background on everything you print is School Bathroom
  Green. You are stuck with Lotto squares on the board (bad for me
  since I believe gambling is evil). And you only have twelve
  Good/Bad News cards. I liked making my own money, though. I
  figured out how to do most of the same stuff in Word. Here's how:
  I took the board from a "Your Town" clone of Monopoly and
  measured between the big squares. I think the individual squares
  are 2.5 by 3.5, but it doesn't matter, since your board may be
  different. In Word, I used a legal-sized paper (I think that's A5
  for you Brits) and made a table that was nine columns that's how
  many are on my board) and two rows. Then I messed with it to get
  the proportions correct. You can fit three rows on one sheet of
  legal paper, if the return is really small, like 5 points. That
  gives you space to cut. To get color bars, get your cursor in the
  top row. Type any letter. Then highlight it, go up to "format"
  and click on borders and shading. Click on shading, click on a
  color, then make sure it says "cell" and not text or table. I use
  only 15 percent for most colors. Click on OK and you should have
  a color bar. Type in whatever text you want. Then click below to
  type in your property name. On printing, I found the last squares
  were outside the printing range, so I will only have eight
  squares next time and will print a separate sheet for "railroad"
  squares. The corner squares are about 2.5 inches on my board. I
  would recommend you make them bigger, then trim to size, so you
  won't have any dead space on your board. Cut and glue to a board
  you picked up at a thrift shop or yard sale and painted or
  covered. The property cards. These were actually easier than I
  thought. Make a table one column wide and two rows deep. Make it
  fill the whole page. Color as above, and type in whatever you
  want. When you print them out, print out 8 or 16 pages to a sheet
  to get cards. For chance and community chest ... well, what I
  came up with was using mail merge and a shipping label template.
  You just print out on regular card or paper, and cut. The data
  file used for the merge would have your classy one-liners. I
  don't know about putting graphics in. Also, I can't figure out
  how to use merge. I did it once but can't figure it out now.
  Money I haven't been able to do. I have QuarkXpress and Adobe
  Pagemaker but don't know how to use either program. Plus, I
  wanted to make the money in Paint or something simple. Hope these

  peace in Palestine until the Zionists came from Europe, massacred
  the Palestinians (Dir Yassin, etc.) and forced them to run away
  from their lands and get locked into the refugee camps across the
  borders for almost three generations. Studying in a Jewish
  religious school in Tel Aviv, I was taught that the 'bad Arabs'
  conducted pogroms all over Palestine killing Jews. My family told
  me the opposite: we lived in Palestine in peace for generations
  with our Moslem brothers. When the Zionists started their pogroms
  (Dir Yassin), the Moslem acted in revenge and started their own
  pogroms, killing Jews. However, our Moslem friends actually saved
  the lives of our family by hiding us in their own houses at a

  <Text category="book">Firstly, let me say the research Nicholas
  Lardy has conducted is commendable and a welcome addition to the
  existing literature. His data sources are vast and highly
  informative. The major limitation of this publication is that the
  central argument is biased. Lardy selects those data and pieces
  of existing literature which support his own view. As a result,
  major sections of the literature concerning financial reform in
  transitional economies are simply ignored or brushed over.
  Lardy's view is the typical Western, dare I say
  &amp;amp;quot;American&amp;amp;quot; argument. Primarily he uses
  financial criteria to evaluate the economic performance of
  China's state banks. This methodoloy is extremely poor -
  particularly in the context of China's trannsitional economy.
  Financial criteria are a horrible guide to both internal and
  allocative economic efficiency. If anyone would like elaboration
  on this point feel free to email me. In summary, Lardy's book is
  informative and makes for interesting reading. However as a piece
  of economic analysis, its usefulness is limited. The major reason
  for this is a total lack of economic theory(as indicated by the
  previous reviewer) which has resulted in a poor
  methodology</Text>
  <Text category="book">No doubt about it. This book covers the
  history of the Border Patrol. However, it falls far short of what
  it ostensibly bills itself and ends up more as a "fluff piece"
  than anything else. As someone who has not only served as a
  Senior Border Patrol Agent (13 years) but also a Border Patrol
  union president and outspoken critic of the agency, I have
  studied this agency inside and out without the affects of tunnel
  vision that typically accompany the job (many say a necessity).
  Pacheco, as an active agent (when he wrote the book at least),
  appears headed in the right direction with the book and then
  suddenly veers off target. His somewhat ambiguous message that
  border security is a difficult task is obviously an attempt to
  straddle the line (I apologize for the pun) so as not to appear
  too contentious or controversial. Did he need to seek agency
  approval for publication since he was actively employed? If so,
  then the credibility issue leaps out and the book is worth the
  historical content alone if nothing else. If he did not need
  agency approval and was truly writing without restraint, then he
  failed to accurately convey the real state of the Border Patrol
  and border security. Simply put, the Border Patrol, as with most
  of the Homeland Security subcomponents is disintegrating.
  Remember the incompetence of FEMA (a Homeland Security
  subcomponent)? Well, multiply that incompetence times ten. Heard
  about the poor morale of FEMA employees? Multiply that problem by
  one-hundred and you have an accurate picture of the Border
  Patrol. A Border Patrol in which the vast majority of otherwise
  employable agents spend ninety-percent of their time trying to
  get out. Those that choose to stay in do so only because of the
  comparatively worse off agencies in DHS. The bottom line is that
  as a former agent, I lose sleep at night knowing what I know.
  Pacheco did cover the rigorous training regimen accurately even
  if it bordered on propaganda. That alone may attract candidates
  to the difficult and completely unrewarding position of U.S.
  Border Patrol Agent. The field stories are completely unappealing
  to anyone who served more than a week in a law enforcement
  position unless they are reading about their own exploits. Read
  the book for enjoyment and homage. Just don't expect critical
  analysis. In fact, this book would be an enjoyable read at
  Stewarts Bridge (for you IB agents in San Diego).</Text>

  <Text category="book">I recently decided to become vegetarian, so I
  got this book to read. I was very disapointed. I think this book
  provides good information about nutrional and meals, yet is
  written in a boring, scientific way. This book may appeal more to
  parents of vegetarians and vegans and adult vegetarians, than to
  teenagers. This book contains a lot of recipies, and some of them
  sound good, but most of them are far more complex than a teenager
  would be willing to cook. I would reccomend this book to parents
  of teenage vegetarians, but there are better books written for
  the teens themself. This book also has so many negative quotes
  including a whole page of someone making fun of vegetarian food
  and rambling about how they hate tofu. I don't think these are
  nessecary in a book for vegetarians, there is enough of that
  without reading about it. However, if you seriously want to
  research about being a vegetarian this book won't hurt, it is
  just a dissapointment</Text>
  <Text category="book">Flynn offers up a fast-paced, if unbelievable
  story. Unfortunately, character development is paper thin and
  clearly portrays Flynn's political preferences. Characters, like
  Rapp, with a military background are guided by clearly defined

  those good-for-nothing politicians how the "real world" works.
  Meanwhile, Flynn's politicians (the majority of whom are
  Democrats) seem only concerned with public opinion and the next
  election. While there are grains of truth in his characters,
  Flynn consistently goes for the cheap, partisan stereotype. I was
  looking for a well-developed political/military thriller. I'm
  still looking.</Text>

  gargoyles that popped up in the foreground of the shot in blazing
  white about six inches from my face making it completely
  impossible to focus on the actual movie. Some of the torture
  scenes and the Faustian plotline, along with the hideous firey
  face that is Mr. D make this movie too dark and scary for anyone
  under the age of 10, but the terrible plot along with the worst
  voice-acting I have had the displeasure to hear in my life make
  the film unbearable for anyone over the age of 10. Basically, I
  guess you could say I was slightly displeased with the movie. I
  do have to admit that I got a hearty laugh when the main
  character, Johnny (played by Jasper Steverlinck, an up-and-coming
  rocker and lead singer of the band Arid, a decent rock group that
  was featured at the end of the movie in the only bright spot I

  this piece of work. I found the book exceedingly boring, a chore
  to read every step of the way. As the Iberian peninsula
  physically separates from Europe, several unengaging and
  underdeveloped characters (the most interesting of which was a

  certainly none I cared about. While the book may have been

  harmonizer tuned up an octave to achieve this effect, because I
  can't imagine how his vocal chords could withstand a tour sung
  this way. A few tunes sung this way I can handle, buts its total
  overkill on this DVD. The behind the scenes extras are enjoyable
  because Zakk is a funny guy</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Really not worth the effort to find it, even
  if George MacDonald Fraser was involved with the screenplay. The
  producers chose the "least best" of the Flashman novels to adapt,
  they cast the wrong actor to play the role, and they reduced the
  whole story to a bawdy, not-very-funny, slapstick comedy. Don't
  bother searching for it. True Flashman fans will be
  disappointed</Text>

  <Text category="toys_games">I bought this game on the fly cause the cover
  illustration looked so interesting that I couldn't resist. The
  instructions were a little confusing to understand at first, but
  once gameplay started it was picked up pretty easy and much fun
  was enjoyed by everyone. The game is geared for those ages 10 and
  up, but it was so easy to understand and so much fun, that my 8
  year old neice was able to play without teaming up with an adult.
  The game promotes math skills which is a HUGE plus since many
  games today are only about fun. This game has it all, fun,
  education and the artwork on the cards is fantastic. When we
  played, we threw in chocolate gold pieces so we'd have real
  pirate plunder and everyone had to speak like a pirate. It's a
  really great way to spend quality time with your family and it's
  fun for all ages</Text>

  rip-off price. They could make a great profit selling these
  refills at something like $2.50 each, their rip off price of
  $8.50 ea is beyond absurd. The other thing is that when you buy
  their toothbrush they have something in there like the brush
  heads last 2 months. That's a real laugh. Even brushing just once
  a day, you're lucky if you get a month out of them. So not only
  do they rip you off with their refill cost, they also lie to you
  to get you locked into their product to begin with</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I was surprised that so many people childishly
  attacked the person who gave this movie one-star. Someone even
  accused them of not being young at heart. Well, I don't like this
  film, and I'm young at heart; I'm just not immature, so try not
  to confuse the two. Some of you need to check your spelling
  before accusing someone else of bad writing. Having said that, on
  to the film: Julie and friends are simply DYING to be included in
  the in-crowd their first year of high school, so on the night
  Julie has a sleepover, they make a deal with some rival girls to
  go on a "scavenger" hunt, which is basically one huge dare game.
  The group that fulfills the dares first get to be popular by...
  (drumroll, please) sitting at The Popular Lunch Spot. That is, a
  picnic bench by the school fountain. That's right; popularity is
  not guaranteed by WHO you sit with, but WHERE you sit. Pick the
  right spot, and you may just magically become Queen Bee for the
  rest of the year. In case you couldn't tell by my sarcasm, the
  shallow impracticality of this film truly bugs me at times. We
  all know the whole popularity thing is practically a tradition
  for teen chick-flicks, but this film tended to go over the top
  with a lot of it. Granted, a lot of the exaggerated silliness
  worked for the film; in fact, the movie's beginning surprised me
  with many clever and well-written clips. However, there is such a
  thing as going too far. The movie becomes absolutely dedicated to
  making teen girls look like sassy but fashionably ingenuis bimbos
  and making teen boys look like...well, the dumbest, scruffiest
  beings that ever stumbled on the planet. Not that all the boys
  are like this, mind you; there are a few of the god-like types
  that the girls practically kill themselves for. It got worse,
  however, when the film attempted to fit in a few serious scenes.
  If the movie had stuck to pure sarcastic silliness the whole
  time, it might've worked. Instead,the few attempts to be serious
  usually fell flat on their faces because the seriousness went in
  the wrong direction. For example, there was the nauseating scene
  where poor beaten Julie nearly gives up her scavenger hunt and
  one of her friends says, "Julie, I KNOW you can do this; I
  believe in you" in a tone which implies that they're talking
  about a major life crisis instead of a juvenile daredevil game.
  The worst "serious" scene, however, is when Julie attempts to get
  into a dance (therefore fulfilling the final dare) and the ticket
  seller won't let her in because she doesn't have a ticket.
  Suddenly inspired, Julie gives the ticket seller a sickening "I
  know who you are" speech, telling her that she knows she was a
  nerd her whole high school life and that now, because of her
  former nerdiness, she's become a poor ticket seller. Julie ends
  her speech by wailing, "I can see myself being you in four years
  if I don't go to this dance!" The ticket seller leaps to her feet
  but, instead of punching Julie, suddenly breaks into a smile and
  says, "Go ahead and go in!" Um, WHAT?? Whatever happened to the
  girls finding out that popularity isn't everything after all and
  actually getting lives and acting like humans? (Not to mention
  that nice sock in the mouth I was hoping Julie would get). Is
  this what we want to teach our kids, that being dedicated to work
  makes them nerds and that partying all the time will get them
  somewhere in life? I personally think the "nerds" are far better
  off than the girls who lose their virginity on the first date and
  party all year rather than learn anything. It was this scene and
  this message that seriously lowered the film in my opinion. I'm
  not sure why the filmmakers decided to end the film with this
  childish message. Maybe they did it on a dare because the popular
  filmmakers finally offered them a cool lunch spot in exchange. I
  recommend "Never been Kissed" and "Mean Girls" far more than this
  film; they have good moral lessons as well as intelligent humor.
  Oh, before I finish, here's one more valuable lesson from this
  film: Girls, if you want to win a guy who's never noticed you,
  all you have to do is strike a cool pose, hop on a skateboard,
  and ride it directly in front of his car. (Don't forget to wear
  an expensive dress and look flawless while you're at it). Do
  this, and he will be so in love with you that he won't even care
  if you tell him that you did something freakish like stealing his
  underwear. The things we learn from movies, huh?</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Great casting, but poor choice of a stage
  script to translate to film. It's so aggravating. I want to chew
  my own leg off half way into it. I know part of it is everyone is
  a "talker" of a various sort. They're all a different type of
  scam artist for this reason in how they sell. I just don't think
  it works. Otherwise talented dialog delivery that comes off
  totally contrived. The best actors in this are playing cliches of
  themselves. It gives stage to screen adaptations a bad name.

  <Text category="toys_games">My boys thought that a treasure chest sandbox
  was a cool idea, being into the pirate theme. Thankfully I
  purchased this sandbox in-store, because I returned it the very
  same day. I didn't even fill it with sand before I realized it
  was a cheaply made toy. The plastic is thin and was bent or
  warped in a few places. The lid wouldn't fit on correctly, even
  if it wasn't bent at some of the edges it wouldn't have been a
  good, secure fit. I was surprised that Little Tikes would make
  something so flimsy. I exchanged it for the Step 2 Naturally
  Playful Sandbox, which is sturdier and the lid works much better.
  Spend the extra $10 for a sandbox that is higher quality.</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">While visiting some family in Utah a few years
  ago we decided to rent a few movies to pass the unforgivably hot
  mid-summer weather. We ended up renting "Analyze That" and boy,
  what a mistake that was! We were expecting at least a mildly
  funny sequel to 1999's "Analyze This." The potential was there,
  it's not as if writers (of course it's never a good sign to see
  numerous writers) Peter Tolan, Peter Steinfeld, and Harold Ramis
  didn't have decent material to work with; Robert DeNiro, Billy
  Crystal, Lisa Kudrow, and a funny and entertaining plotline
  regarding mobsters and therapy. However, this being Hollywood and
  all, another sequel was botched. It's because of movies like
  these that sequels have such a bad reputation. Despite a few
  genuine laughs in the first twenty minutes or so regarding DeNiro
  and some "fish out of water" situations, the movie seemed to go
  downhill soon after. The jokes became few and between as the film
  laboriously plowed its way through an over-the-top heist setup
  and execution that felt about as inspired as "Crossroads." Now
  either they ran out of jokes, they didn't have enough time to
  invest in an actual story, or the material itself has been played
  out in so many different ways already ("The Sopranos", "The Whole
  9 Yards", "Mickey Blue Eyes", etc. etc.), that there was simply
  nothing left to write about</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I had high hopes for this series when I
  started watching it, though I guess the nonstop obscenities
  should have been the tip off that under all of that visual
  masterwork and spiritually stunning characterizations there
  lurked an twisted message that wasted ten hours of my life to
  discover. Shandala is truly a wonderful character, pure and good,
  and the characterization of her is very tender, so by episode 21
  or so the storyline actually looked like it could end hopeful and
  uplifting. Oh, how wrong of me to think so, because for all of
  the philosophical and religious trappings, the message of "hope"
  the marketers promise is that the characters learn in the end
  that the villain's demented plan to save the world is really more
  effective than their spiritualities and that the "truth" is that
  the emotional and physical torture and destruction of an
  innocent, good woman is the only way to save the world! Spare me.
  And if you think that I am disgusted by this message, just
  imagine what the Muslims will think when they see what becomes of
  all of that quoting of the Koran and the Muslim character's final
  opinions. Although the story is technically good, I'm only giving
  it one star for the message of despair.</Text>
  <Text category="book">Eugene O'Neill's play "Long Day's Journey Into
  Night" is a Pulitzer award winning, autobiographical play about
  his family. I must admit that though Eugene O'Neill is considered
  by some to be the father of American Theater, I did not enjoy
  reading this play. The Tyrone family's insane dysfunction with
  their constant bickering and apologizing was very annoying and
  frustrating to read. I also disliked the fact that after four
  acts of continuous yelling and tension O'Neill offered no
  conclusion. The day in the life of the Tyrone family gets
  progressively worse until it finally peaks and the play just
  ends. No happy ending, no hope for the future, just despair.
  "Long Day's Journey Into Night" is a wholly depressing read that
  I really could have done without. However, after learning more
  about Eugene O'Neill's background, and the extent to which the
  play is based on his life, I began to have a greater appreciation
  for this play. O'Neill did lead a very hard life, therefore the
  frustration and despair I felt while reading this play
  demonstrates O'Neill's talent to engage his audience and to
  convey the emotions of the characters in a very real manner.
  While O'Neill's depressing end did not satisfy my craving for a
  happy ending, it was appropriate for the play as Eugene's own
  family never got a happy ending. I did like the clever way
  O'Neill showed the Tyrone family's desire but inability to forget
  their troubles through the dialogue. At the beginning of the play
  the audience is presented with a normal, loving family. The
  audience soon however, gets the suspicion that something isn't
  quite right, and that the family is tense. Slowly the family's
  skeletons are exposed through arguments between the family
  members, but the characters always feel regretful for bringing
  the subject up. Thus showing that no matter how hard the Tyrone
  family tries to pretend that all is well, their skeletons are
  always with them and resurface to continually remind them of the
  truth. Although I still believe "Long Day's Journey Into Night"
  to be thoroughly disheartening to read, the reader's emotional
  response to this play leaves no doubt to O'Neill's exceptional
  writing.</Text>

  <Text category="health">The scale is everything the manufacturer
  claims. However, with minimal use by one average sized adult, our
  scale lasted only about nine months. The balance part of the
  scale is very sound, but the battery clip that powers the
  electronics is poorly designed and built of very cheap
  components. I suspect that poor Q&amp;amp;A will result in a
  fairly high percentage of these units failing and recommend that
  you go elsewhere. Today, my scale will not function unless I hold
  the batteries by hand (not too practical when someone is standing
  on it...). Conclusions: * Scale design is nice--looks good. *
  Construction of balance components is solid, glass is very
  strong. Design and construction of the power unit (battery) is
  rather poor. * Scale functions as advertised for a normal sized
  (80kg/175lb) adult ... until the battery power clip dies. *
  Buyers should avoid this scale in favor of something with more
  solid battery compartment and connections. Hope this
  helps!</Text>

  <Text category="book">god forbid i be so bold as to trash a classic.
  and yes, maybe because of all the raving reviews from my friends
  and from the book's great reputation, i entered it with high
  expectations. - which the book however did not satisfy. yes, it
  is a good comedic parody of the upper class of the time, a
  lampoon of the courtship ritual, and of course oh so witty, blah
  blah blah, but it just wasn't my cup of tea. the main character
  was likeable, but that aside, i found it completely insufferable
  to read through, and absolutely painfully boring. every
  subsequent event from the very beginning could be predicted, let
  alone the ending. not that anything really ever happens - the
  entire book could be summed up with, "then they walked and talked
  and had tea and walked and talked and had tea, walked and talked
  and had more tea, then got married and lived happily ever after."
  the entire novel was a headache of girly gossip and mental drama.
  it would save more time just to watch a chick flick. so if you're
  interested in the relationship fiascos of fictious characters,
  witnessing the agony over who's going to marry who (even though

  <Text category="dvd">This just to voice my opinion on the new RAN
  transfer. While I agree it is an improvement over the atrocious
  Fox Lorber edition (which is not that great an achievement
  considering the Fox Lorber DVD was one of the worst products in
  the history of home entertainment), this tranfer is still a long
  way from doing this masterpiece justice. Yes, the colors are
  vivid but the sharpness and definition are exceptionally poor and
  the heavy edge enhancement (straight from hell!) doesn't make it
  any better. I have seen transfers of movies that are some 30 or
  40 years older than RAN but look far better. The problem becomes
  very obvious when one watches this DVD via progressive component
  output on a large screen - a video tape was used as a master (and
  a poor one at that). The only way to restore such an important
  movie properly and thereby finally showing Mr. Kurosawa the
  respect he deserves would have been to make a direct digital
  transfer off an original film negative, before applying filters
  or any enhancements. Why this opportunity was (again) wasted here
  escapes me totally and angers me very much. Another problem seems
  to be the excessive use of noise reduction on the video, which is
  in part responsible for the poor definition of the transfer. For
  my part, I would much sooner live with a bit of visible film
  grain and the odd dust speckle than to have a such a "saucy" soft
  picture without much "bite" and detail. There is no excuse for
  posting such an objectively false statement. And yes, the
  packaging is a liability - my DVDs must have been bobbing about
  in there all the way across the Atlantic and looked accordingly.
  Shocking. I would have gladly payed twice the price if they had
  kept all the cards and posters and instead got the most important
  thing right: the image quality of RAN. Like this, I'm very

  answer is, simply, no. Ms. Cumbey quotes other texts by other
  zealotous fundamentalists, to be sure. However, the credentials
  of these people remain a mystery. Anyone can write a book, and
  anyone with enough money can get it published. Had I the funds, I
  could write a "revealing, riveting best seller" on the nature of

  don't know if it is because they are a little big or the quality

  Tanita BC554 scale or Omron HBF-306C hand held. Omron, replaced

  awful movie good reviews. The premise is absurd: namely, that
  anybody would even THINK about giving up three or six years of

  preposterous in itself - for smoking some hash. My advice to

  <Text category="book">This is just another attack by organized
  medicine on Alternative treatments and therapies, in particular
  chiropractic. Dr. Rosenfeld comes across as biased, ignorant and
  at times completely malicious in the information he provides. His
  assertion that he "loves chiropractors is disingenous at best."
  He prefers non-specific manipulation by a doctor who can also
  prescribe (toxic) drugs. He lists warnings about chiropractic
  that are extremely rare, occuring one in many millions, and
  suggests that these are common occurances. He fails to mention
  that the practice of (Allopathic) medicine is the third leading
  cause of preventable death in The United States, which is the
  very reason we need more practitioners of the so called
  "Alternatives". If you want good advice, start by avoiding books
  on alternative medicine written by medical doctors, especially
  this one!!</Text>

  <Text category="book">I have read Baldacci's first four novels and
  have immensely enjoyed all of them. This one, however, is just
  awful. Not only the character's dialogue but even the story
  itself is written like a really bad detective movie. The only
  thing I can think of to compare it to is this : There was a
  series of Calvin and Hobbes cartoons where Calvin imagines
  himself as a private detective and they are written like the old
  detective shows, with lame lines like "The gun was loaded, and so
  was I". That is exactly what this book is like, except it goes on
  for 400 pages. There isn't a single interesting character in this
  book, in my opinion. You just have to slog your way through the
  book to get to the end. It's the Bataan Death March of novels. I
  hope this is an aberration - I'll certainly give him another try

  <Text category="toys_games">First of all, please realize that the customer
  pictures of this item are totally off. This thing is a foot cube,

  that the wires on top were bent in such a way that there was no
  way for the Elmo block to move at all. Shoddy at best. We've had

  <Text category="dvd">The first was one of the best thrillers ever,
  with clever suspence, good characters, decent acting and awesome
  effects. This one is... meh. Why must you make a sequel to a huge
  success hit and turn the franchise into a straight-to-video
  series? What's the bloody point? Now there are some good parts.
  The rooms are pretty nice and the musice score is decent, but you
  know, that doesn't even save it. This movie is a annoying,
  pointless and downright piece of crap that only kids can easily
  love. It is so un-intelligent it really makes you wanna puke. The
  characters are nothing but cardboard cut-outs. I don't even know
  them well. All they do is scream, run around in the Cube rooms
  and cannot keep their mouths shut. I also really hate the effects
  in this one as well. They felt like they were over-used. There is
  even a scene where a guy gets cut into peices and look how badly
  done it was. The direction is ok, but when it comes to adding
  wierdness, it's too much. I don't understand the story, there's a
  strange sex-scene which a Cube movie does not need. Cube is about
  suspence. This one is just about adding too much effects, a
  four-dimensional Cube and trying to make itself look better than
  the first one. You don't need that stuff. If you wanted to make a
  sequel better than the first, add something original, don't take
  itself too seriously and make sure it stays true to the original.
  But no, you just had to add all this unoiriginal time crap and
  have alot of special effects taking over and even a sex scene
  which is not cool because if it's a Cube movie, you don't need
  nudity. Overall, if you wanna kill off some time by watching this
  crap, go ahead. I know you like watching people getting killed in
  unoriginal ways and watching sex scenes. If you're a fan of Cube,
  dont' bother. Acting: 3/10 Ugh, don't get me started. These
  actors have bad acting skills and I hope they die. Gore Factor:
  4/10 CGI gore?! Come on!? T&amp;amp;A: 1/10 A Cube movie doesn't
  need nudity and they don't know that because they don't know
  Cube. Direction: 7/10 Andrzej Sekula did have some visual eye in
  some parts. I did enjoy a few scenes and I dug the rooms, but you
  know, I can't say he's a great director. He turned the franchise
  with straight-to-video written all over it. Bottom Line: If you
  wanna watch, go ahead, then you'll be sorry. This movie is just
  sad. It doesn't try anything to impress you because it's idiotic.
  Lets hope Andrzej Sekula learned his lesson and should never do a
  sequel to an impressive indipendent film again</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">As the other reviewers make clear, this is a
  disturbing film in that the college girl forced into prostitution

  you may immediately assume that the director has a deeper comment

  watched the movie, I am not convinced there is anything below the
  surface. Prostitution is a fact of life in Asian cities, the
  theme of women overcome by their desires and in thrall to strong
  men a common one, and I searched in vain for any subversion of or
  challenge to that fantasy (as fantasy it is). Is this any more
  than a homage to the inutility of futility? Not that I can

  <Text category="toys_games">The photo presented here is a bit too bright
  and the faces are not that orange in this paperback edition's
  cover. However you can get a feel for the checked floor and how
  after opening the pages of The Doorbell Rang you get an eye sore
  with the blue checkered tablecloth in the kitchen with the blue
  stove and red appliances. The mother and daughter are both
  redheads and there is a black cat that hangs around during the
  story that takes place in the kitchen. With just twenty pages my
  seven-year old breezed through the book in six minutes. The
  favorite character in the book according to my son is the cat and
  watching where he was throughout the story. The Doorbell Rang
  begins with a Mother placing a plate of cookies on the kitchen
  table for her son Sam and daughter Victoria. " I've made some
  cookies for tea, said Ma". The children each took six cookies
  comparing the look and smell of these cookies to Grandma's. By
  flipping through the pages of the Doorbell Rang it looks like the
  kitchen table got bigger, but upon further inspection the same
  number of chairs are there, but more kids around the table and
  fighting over the seats. The cat is making his way around the
  kids to receive pats on the head and attention. More kids arrived
  bringing a bicycle and a doll carriage and the table shows each
  kid with one cookie. It is hard to tell if the cookies are on
  white plates or that is just part of the checkered tablecloth.
  The serving plate is clearly empty at this point and all the kids
  turn to see the latest bell ringer. Meanwhile over at the stove
  the steam is continuing but at a larger pace and it looks like
  fresh water now in the orange pail. The final arrival for this
  story is Grandma, with a large cookie sheet type tray carrying
  freshly baked chocolate chip cookies. All the kids leave the
  table to greet her and the cat ends up alone on the kitchen
  table. Not very sanitary as far as I am concerned and my son
  noticed no napkins or drinks at the table. The dirty floor was
  bothering him as well and he wondered why the kids never took
  their shoes off for that is something we all do upon entering our
  home. The portrayal of the Mother and how the stove was not being
  attended and having the cat on the table bothered me. The kids
  not stopping to wipe their feet or hanging up their own
  belongings and no one washing their hands before having a cookie
  and who knows how many times the kids each touched one of them.
  At least the kids were dressed nice and the bucket of water never
  spilled and the Mother finally sat down. For a new reader this
  might be a fun read but for more than one read I highly doubt
  there would be interest. There is a lot of repetition with the
  arrival of new kids and then the sharing of the cookies while
  comparing them to each child's Grandma's cookies. There are
  roughly two to four sentences on each page. The good news is that
  my son did not ask for any cookies after reading this</Text>

  <Text category="book">Oh my, all the terrible reviews for this book

  Steel knows and hangs out with, but she had these me talking
  about their feelings with each other, as well as how their
  dysfunctional pasts had affected them. Oh please, no man on earth
  talks that way. Especially to other men. This book is completely
  aweful. The plot is so slow and does not grab the readers
  attention. I have read many of Ms. Steel's books and I believe
  this one is her worst. I have now started reading Sandra Brown
  and she is sooo much better. I recommend "The Alibi." So far that
  has been my favorite by her. She has mystery, suspense,

  arts&amp;amp;quot; in the movie are weak and sloppy, there's no
  way that crap would actually work in real life. I don't even know

  stupidity amusing. The cover makes it look like it would be a
  cool movie, unfortunately that's the only thing they put much
  effort into. I rented it from Block Buster too, they need to burn

  <Text category="dvd">This is a rather peculiar film for Seagal, and
  the first thing that should be pointed out to any Seagal fan
  contemplating whether or not to give this one a try is that this
  is really not an action film. Seagal only has a couple fight
  scenes in the whole film and they are all extremely brief. In
  fact, they are extraordinarily brief, though thankfully free of
  wirefu. Though Out of Reach is by no means a total failure (it's
  actually pretty entertaining, Seagal as always is fun to watch,
  and some of the scenes are well done), the script nevertheless
  exhibits some problems and plot holes. This film is a drama about
  a nature nut (Seagal) who roams the forest looking for injured
  animals. He has a pen pal in Poland, a young girl, and when he
  hears that she will no longer be able to correspond with him he
  becomes so upset that he travels abroad to look for her, even
  though he really has no reason to suspect that anything is wrong
  with her. This brings up the main problem with this film, namely,
  a lot of it simply doesn't make any sense. It turns out that the
  girl has been sold to a human trafficking ring, and Seagal goes
  through the motions to save her. As per usual with Seagal
  nowadays, he obviously refused to actually finish the production,
  and so we have the usual dubbing problem here. It is even more
  salient than usual in this picture, however, for here we have not
  one, but several different people dubbing Seagal's voice, none of
  whom even remotely sound a thing like him! Here the most
  frequently heard fill-in for Seagal sounds like a knock-off
  Benecio Del Toro with a much higher-pitched voice. As you can
  imagine, the effect is very humorous. As stated above, the main
  problem with this movie is that it simply doesn't make sense,
  which was apparently realized by the director, as he has, in many
  scenes, the voice fill-in for Seagal narrating an explanation of
  what the character is thinking! How obnoxious! Seagal's character
  likes to teach codes and ciphers to his pen pal, which she later
  uses to communicate with Seagal. What makes no sense is that
  every time she leaves a message for Seagal, the villian, ineptly
  played by Matt Schultz, sees the girl doing it and yet leaves the
  message for Seagal to find! In one ridiculous scene the girl
  arranges some caviar on crackers to make a code. (Apparently
  three crackers of one kind followed by three crackers of another
  kind followed by three crackers of another kind means "This is a
  trap.") The villain sees her doing this, and, instead of
  destroying the message (which would make sense), later has it
  delivered to Seagal! Huh? In a scene when the girl leaves a
  message on a mirror telling Seagal where she is, the villian sees
  her doing it, comments on how clever she is, but then leaves the
  message! There are also quite of few mistakes in this film,
  several of which are laughably obvious. At the beginning and end
  of this film, for example, Seagal has long hair which looks like
  frizzy, black cotton candy being pulled off the back of his head.
  During the rest of the film, however, he has short hair. At the
  end, after some BS macho dialogue about how Seagal hates taking
  life but will enjoy killing Schultz slowly, each character
  uncocks his pistol even though Schultz's pistol does not have an
  external hammer to uncock, and even though in the very next
  closeup Seagal's pistol is still cocked! After a sword fight,
  which ends on a classic move from older chambara films, notice
  that there is clearly no blood on the floor, and that then,
  all-of-a-sudden, there is a huge trail of blood between the two
  characters. In the finale, the above-mentioned sword fight, the
  camera cuts between closeups of the two characters to faraway
  shots that are clearly of someone other than Seagal. This brings
  up another frequent complaint of many Seagal fans: his overuse of
  stunt doubles. It's almost so bad now that one could say that he
  doesn't even film his own fight scenes now. Have you ever noticed
  that in Lord Steven's early films, when there was a fight scene
  the camera would pull back and let you see his moves? Now what
  happens? The camera gets as close as possible, shows some shots
  of his face grunting, shows some arms playing paddycake, then
  pulls back showing some fighting while never showing Seagal's
  face. Ever wonder why? It's because, surprise, surprise, that's
  not Seagal doing the fighting. In the gun fight, which is
  actually a very decent action scene, watch Seagal as he enters
  the room. His character enters the fight by doing a foward aikido
  roll, which is probably the simplest move in aikido, though it is
  obvious that it is not Seagal doing the roll. What is even more
  irksome is that both at the beginning and the end of the film,
  which shows Seagal's character "roaming the forest looking for
  injured animals," or whatever, it is clearly not Seagal that we
  see walking through the forest. Was he afraid that he'd trip over
  a branch and injure himself? Was he afraid he'd be attacked by an
  injured animal in the woods? I don't know. What is likely the
  case is that Seagal again refused to finish the shoot and some
  scenes had to be constructed after-the-fact, using another actor,
  in order to make the film work. I'm really not bashing Seagal,
  I'm merely complaining because these are persistent types of
  flaws in his recent films that could VERY easily be fixed. Be on
  the lookout for the bizarre scene when Seagal goes to the post
  office. The postal worker calls Seagal "Mr. Delacraw," or some
  such bizarre name, even though his character's name is actually
  Billy Ray Lancing. Seagal then proceeds to mumble some French to
  the man, and then suddenly adopts a cajun accent. This scene is
  downright strange. What is also strange is how Seagal is dressed
  in this scene--like some kind of New Orleans Anne Rice fan,
  vampire wannabe in a strange, black fur coat. I don't know, at
  least it's good for a laugh. If Seagal continues in this manner
  he will quickly find himself unemployable. The only truly
  schocking thing is that this hasn't happened yet. He shows up
  late to shoots, leaves early, refuses to finish productions, and
  yet people keep hiring the man. He repeatedy refuses to do the
  requisite work for a complete production. He needs to start
  finishing his films. In closing, Out of Reach only has two VERY
  brief fight scenes, but they are somewhat well done. Seagal
  actually takes a few blows in the climatic fight, which is a very
  nice change and certainly makes his character seem more
  human.</Text>
  <Text category="book">Talk about taking the joy out of an
  experience. I read this book prior to a week-long trip to Venice.
  This book quite simply accomplished none of its objectives. It is
  a poor &amp;amp;quot;guidebook&amp;amp;quot; and is poorly
  written and uninteresting in terms of a travelogue. The history
  and art of Venice are covered better in books from those genres.
  The only upside is that it is short. Yuck, what a waste of time.
  My advice is: get a novel about Venice if you like novels, a
  guidebook if you want that, an art book, or a history book. At
  least you'll get something out of those--this one tries all of
  these and fails. Actually, in terms of a travelogue,

  <Text category="music">As much as I like most of the songs on this

  <Text category="dvd">This series represents the second attempt to
  revive TZ, and is vastly inferior to its predecessor. The series
  began with some built-in problems, particularly the choice of
  Forest Whitaker as host-narrator. Mr. Whitaker is a fine actor,
  but a poor choice to host the series, and he appears quite
  uncomfortable when introducing episodes, often walking around
  while delivering his opening lines. After watching some of these
  episodes, one can understand Forest's discomfort; he probably
  regretted accepting the job. Another major problem is that this
  series came out on UPN, which has never been (and never will be)
  a leader in quality programming. Although there are some
  interesting story ideas, they usually fall flat in the end. "It's
  Still A Good Life" is a noteworthy example. Intended as a sequel
  to one of the best episodes of the original series, and featuring
  original cast members Cloris Leachman and Bill Mumy (with the
  addition of Mumy's daughter, Liliana), this episode gets off to a
  good start, but the plot abruptly takes a silly turn, leading to
  a rushed, nonsensical, and unsatisfying conclusion. This sort of
  hackneyed plotting occurs throughout the series. Talented actors
  simply cannot compensate for lousy writing. This series resembles
  the original in name only, and even the worst of the mid-80's
  episodes is superior to this conglomeration of silly,
  poorly-written, lame stories. The kindest thing that can be said
  for this set is that it is reasonably priced and nicely packaged.
  Enjoy it for what it is, but, as Andy Taylor once told Gomer
  Pyle, "Don't over-expect."</Text>

  <Text category="toys_games">Yum...play food! This is a great set. I will
  buy it as soon as I find it. This is a great set! Lots of cans
  (good for storage), ice cream, boxed treats, cookies, (yummy),
  and of course, much more. And who could resist the spaghetti with
  meatballs? And is that chocolate chips on the ice cream? Oh my
  gosh, it's better than I thought. You might think that to have a
  good time, your child needs 40 dollar Melissa and Doug wooden
  play food with real cutting noises and a Fisher Price 100 dollar
  kitchen for imaginative play. Bullpies, I say. I have tons of
  dollar-store food. I have ultra-realistic foam food from a
  kitchen set I got. I prefer the dollar store food. Dollar store
  food is better because it has more in one package, looks real, is
  cheap, pretty durable, and looks nice. I have a really silly play
  food set that came with a stovetop (small, but the knobs turn!),
  a pink and purple propane tank, a can of "barracuda" (seriously),
  and a can of "barracuda hash" which included barracuda, ham and
  eggs, chicken, turkey, potpie, and more eggs. But the logo has
  spam and a hotdog, and the front of it has beans, turkey, fish,
  sausage, and lots of weird meat. But it says "Eatable, 100%
  dainty, Present!, Daintiness, Dainty". Just wanted to let you
  know. So, bottom line is, dollar store play food is much better
  than you think it is. It comes with lots of things that the

  <Text category="health">OK folks, this is a relatively low quality
  starter kit from a really decent company. The Art of Shaving
  products in general are really nice, albeit a tad pricey. This
  small kit gives you a nice sample of an entire line of shaving
  products that work nicely together. The full sized items will
  cost you about $75 - $100 total. The included brush is a "toss
  away" quality brush. This is not just my opinion, but a quote
  from the manager at an Art of Shaving store. My advice is to get
  some samples from a department store, then purchase the Art of
  Shaving shave cream (wow! a great product) here on Amazon, plus
  either the Tweezerman Badger Brush for $15 or a Best Badger Brush
  from Crabtree &amp;amp; Evelyn for $35.</Text>

  for strewing the soft pieces everywhere. There are actually too

  until he's rolled away from it. My 3 year old thinks it's
  interesting, but she just ends up taking it apart and the pieces
  end up all over the place. After a couple days of playing with it
  I usually put most of it away and keep out only a couple parts to
  complement our other toys. The water play mat lasted until my 3
  year old stepped on it once or twice. Then that was gone</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I am from Australia and received these in the
  post and promptly returned them to Amazon. Is a complete season
  of Baywatch really Baywatch when the seasons are labeled
  incorrectly, the music and theme song have been changed and
  episodes are missing? I don't think so. Not only have the
  distributors done fans no favours but Amazon have incorrectly
  labeled the cast. On the Amazon website as part of advertising
  for Season 1 they have incorrectly labeled it. If you go by the
  cast that Amazon have put on, you would think that it WAS the
  real original Season 1, when we know it is not. The release in
  the UK, which is out now and the upcoming release in Australia on
  March 14th is the real deal. Season 1 is the real season 1 and
  all subsequent seasons are correct. There are NO episodes missing
  and the original music and theme song are intact. Might wanna try
  those regions to buy the real deal. AARO</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I wouldn't recommend this movie, unless you
  have nothing else to do for the night and want to watch it alone.
  Due to a high content of bad words, screaming and violence, it's
  kind of embarrassing watching it with someone else. Some people
  really enjoyed it, and that's not me, and that's not the other
  two people I know who watched it. Some violent parts are a bit
  hard to believe, but I guess that's what the story is about. This
  movie is a bit of a hollywood-style suspense, with rather cheesy
  college scenes that are common to comedies. There's one good idea
  in this movie and that's how life develops as it goes along, and
  one action or inaction changes how life plays out. But this is no
  where near original, even the Simpsons had an episode like that.
  So, this movie is definitely not on my best movies list.</Text>

  strewing it all over the playroom! The black and white face was
  good when they are first starting to be attracted to faces but
  other than that, it just got taken apart and lost its interest,
  no matter which way i arranged the peices. Infants would do much

  <Text category="dvd">The depression era introduction was the best
  part of this movie as another reviewer mentioned. From the moment

  village hostage to a tiny part of an island, forces them to
  provide him sacrificial women, and tortures the female star of
  the movie. It seems so ridiculous that she ends up liking King
  Kong. The villains of the movie were my heroes. I kept hoping
  they would succeed in killing him so the pain of this awful movie
  would end</Text>
  <Text category="health">This thing comes with lots of attachments, of
  which I regularly used only 2. The vibrating cuticle pusher is
  silly. As far as all those round discs, it's hard to explain the
  physics of this, but suffice it to say that since it's a rotating
  circle, you can only use half of it at a time or you'll
  experience a bump-bump-bump. The thing rotates at such a speed
  (even the lowest of the two speeds) that even leaving on your toe
  or finger for a moment or two can create a burning sensation.
  What I did use was the smallest pointed attachment, which I used
  to lightly go around my nail close to the cuticle. This was good
  for when you're wearing clear nail polish and your nails are
  starting to grow out. You can lightly buff down that ridge of
  polish. Same goes for the edge where acrylic meets the natural
  nail. The other attachment I used, though less frequently, is the
  bigger cone-shaped one (kind of looks like the shape of a foam
  ear plug). That I used to lightly go over my largest toenails to
  thin them down since I have trouble with ingrown toenails. Again,
  it's a challenge not to create burn when doing so. The nail dryer
  thing is silly and useless. If you manage to cram your hand into
  that little scoop without smudging the polish, it doesn't do much
  anyway to dry your nails any faster than just letting them set.
  Buy a little fan like they use in the shops if you want faster
  drying time. This thing isn't gonna do it. Other folks mentioned
  this thing ruined their nails. It's likely because they tried to
  use all of the attachments (which you'd think you should be able
  to do, right?). Much regular buffing on your nail thins it down
  and weakens it too much. The bump-bump-bump of the round
  attachments likely doesn't help, either. A couple times I used
  this for acrylic nails. I have a tendency to wear acrylic nails a
  few weeks and then hate them and want them removed---and I'm no
  longer willing to subject myself to the soak-and-pry method done
  in the nail salons. So the alternative was soak at home, or just
  trim down myself and then thin them to a more natural curved
  shape until the rest of the acrylic grew out. However, I mention
  I did this only a couple times. That's because apparently
  acrylics are a bit too much of a challenge for this little
  "Deluxe Manicure System." After sounding like it was ailing while
  it filed down the length of 2 acrylic nails, it gave a little bzz
  and then died. I waited a while to see if maybe it overheated. I
  tried other outlets. Nope, dead. So I'd pronounce this unfit for
  natural or acrylic nails. If you want something of quality for
  acrylic nails, invest in the Dremel tools that the salons use
  (just be sure to get one with a low RPM or foot pedal
  attachment). If you want something of quality for natural nails,
  go to the drug store and get some sandpaper nail files, a
  rectangular buffer, and a cuticle pusher. Sometimes the best
  solution is the simplest.</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">Another product of Hollywood's "Karaoke

  success and acclaim of "Das Boot". But instead of a gripping war
  drama that reveals the tragic waste of war, we get a cheap
  flag-waving pile of Hollywood propaganda. The lighting, camera
  angles and claustrophobic set are obviously inspired by DB. But
  the bigoted innacuracies (German submariners machine gunning
  helpless sailors) and absurd scenarios (an incredibly lucky stern
  shot sinks a destroyer in hot pursuit) put this ridiculous movie
  in its own category. U-571 is just another thin, over-promoted,

  <Text category="dvd">First off, let me say that I know next to
  nothing about art. I would like to cultivate an appreciation for
  great artwork, but it certainly does not come naturally -
  especially when it comes to modern art. Dali, however, is a
  master I at least have some affinity with. Who doesn't know of
  the melting clocks? I have also seen the dream sequence he
  created for Hitchcock's film Spellbound in 1945. Plus, the guy
  was just plain weird, and that is something I know a little bit
  about myself. This Artists of the 20th Century DVD looks solely
  at Dali's artwork. All you see throughout the 50 minutes of video
  is one piece after another. There is no biographical look at the
  man, no mention of his contributions to the world beyond his
  paintings, and certainly no commentary on his eccentric
  personality (or mustache). There is not even an adequate
  identification of Gala, his inspiration and muse, despite
  numerous references to her in his paintings. Thus, this DVD will
  not introduce you to Dali the man or Dali the artist - it only
  looks at selected pieces of the art work of the maestro. Dali's
  artwork is obviously impressive, and I was surprised by the
  variety of his work and styles. The narrator offers insight into
  some paintings - others, you just look and advance. I don't
  understand a lot of Dali's work, nor can I see some of the things
  the narrator tells me are in his more abstract pieces. The
  melting clocks and other surrealist images appeal to me. Dark
  works such as Visage of War speak volumes to the human observer,
  and the disappearing bust of Voltaire paintings are also
  striking. I was most impressed by the small sample of classical
  pieces Dali painted, however - largely because I did not know he
  ever produced such works. My idea of a painting equates with
  something like Design for the Interior Decoration of a
  Stable-Library, which is a strikingly beautiful work. Is this DVD
  worth watching? I will have to say No. If you're a know-nothing
  novice like me, there is not enough basic information provided to
  really illuminate the artwork you will be shown. If you're
  knowledgeable about Dali, you'll be disappointed by the limited
  nature of the production and by the exquisite Dali works excluded
  from the show. After watching this, I decided to peruse some Dali
  galleries online, and I must say that the Internet makes this DVD
  of little value. Not only are the analyses and critical comments
  you will find online far superior to the information provided in
  this video, the quality of the paintings themselves are far
  better online than they are on the DVD</Text>

  <Text category="health">I eagerly snapped up this ionic hair dryer
  about over a year ago because of it's retractable cord and
  folding capabilities. Even the price was attractive. It really
  did take up little room in my bathroom drawer and the retractable
  cord was a plus. I thought I had the perfect blow dryer because
  it did what it was supposed to do and quickly. Now for the bad
  news: the retractable cord became chewed up and frayed after
  daily use and it became apparent that the cord was ultimately
  going to fray completely in due time. Then, the folding handle,
  low and behold, broke in half one morning. (Of course, the
  warranty had long expired). This dryer is too fragile to consider
  using on a daily basis and I consider myself a careful person
  when it comes to handling small appliances such as hair dryers.
  When I've replaced hair dryers in the past, it was been because
  they've simply reached the end of their lifespans and burned out.
  I'd caution anyone to consider this before buying because these 2
  features alone, while very appealing, can shorten an otherwise
  good hairdryer's lifespan. I've now purchased a T3 Tourmaline (a
  featherweight, quiet hairdryer with no retractable cord or
  folding handle) which seems to work just fine and appears to have
  a much longer lifespan.</Text>

  greater volume of material that was clearly just pandering to the

  jokes, etc. that are clearly just there for the "outlaw" value.
  And she often descends in to abject preaching on topics that seem
  to either just be things that she's personally bitter about or
  are designed to ingratiate her to her fan base. It's just... not

  <Text category="book">The author shows she is obviously making a
  transition from poetry to prose with this novel. Her sentences
  are long and wordy, and her numerous metaphors make little sense
  in their context. She goes to great lengths to describe many
  little and unimportant details, causing the actual story to
  suffer from lack of content. Her descriptions of life in general
  seem unreal - she describes things and events in a way that no
  person would do in the circumstance. The storyline is decent in
  some places, but it is generally hard for the reader to follow.
  Many times, I had to go back to read paragraphs and pages again
  to realize where the author was going. It is true there were many
  points in which I wanted to stop reading all together, which is a
  rarity. I was altogether disappointed in the book. I thought it

  Was it really necessary to show a shot of a girl's crotch while
  she's driving a car? Was it necessary to have a sex scene or
  nudity scene or drug scene every 3 minutes? You can't help but
  see the director as a pervert who is more preoccupied with sex
  and street cred grittiness than telling a good story. The very
  first scene is of a guy having phone sex. Several things about
  this movie other than the [...] made me mad: 1. You're planning
  to kill somebody, then proceed to tell everybody, including the
  waitress at Pizza Hut what you're planning. 2. After you kill,
  you're so afraid of being caught that you proceed to put more
  suspicion on yourself by acting VERY strange and telling even
  MORE people what you did. 3. Which makes more sense? To decide to
  kill a guy because he disrespects you and beats you up
  occasionally and has sex with your girlfriend, or, to stop
  hanging out with him completely and stop lending your girlfriend
  out like a wh-ore. Bobby never put a gun to the guy's head to
  make him hang out with him, yet murder was the only option? 4. I
  can't believe Mr. Wimp who never fights back can all of a sudden
  muster the strength to slit a guy's throat while he's staring him
  blankly in the face begging for his life. 5. All of the
  characters</Text>

  <Text category="toys_games">I purchased this item for my 5 year old

  <Text category="book">I didn't have especailly high hopes for this
  book. I think there has been a gradual decline in the quality of
  HH books over the years, and this one brings it to a new low.
  Basically, it's waaaaaay too long. At 850 pages, it's a monster
  read, and a slow one. That's not always a bad thing - sometimes
  if you like the characters it's nice to just hang out with your
  friends for page after page. But not here. Why is it necessary to
  describe in detail the exact movements of a treecat using sign
  language? For several paragraphs? More than once? Why are we
  given pages of liturgy for religious services? I think I'd be in
  a very small minority when I confess that I quite like the 1662
  Prayer Book, though I can't quite work out why it would be
  revived in the distant future when it's been out of use here for
  decades! Maybe it was easy to cut and paste, and got the word
  count up. And then there's the space combat - a strength of the
  series, especially the first three or four. But there's the rub -
  there are only so many ways you can describe a spaceship blowing
  up. By the 11th book in the series I can't be the only person out
  there whose eyes are beginning to glaze over when we get to the
  battle sequences. But the big problem - spoiler alert! - is the
  way in which Weber solves the love triangle we left the last book
  with. Honor loves Hamish. Emily loves Hamish. Hamish loves Honor
  and Emily. What to do? It turns out that there's an easy
  solution. After about 400 pages of agonising (not to mention most
  of the previous book) it seems that Honor can marry them both. A
  bit outre? Seemingly not - apparently such arrangements fall well
  within the accepted norms of Manticoran law and custom. (Although
  we've never had a whiff of this before.) But what really gets me
  is that the reason it didn't happen about halfway through the
  last book is that (get this), gosh, no-one thought of it. It
  seems that no-one ever told Mr Weber that if you shoot someone
  with a gun in Act V, the gun better have been hanging on the wall
  in Act I. All-in-all, I can only say, please Mr Weber. It is time
  to bring the series to an end. Please do it soon</Text>

  <Text category="toys_games">My five and half year old daughter asked for
  this particular barbie doll. She was so happy when she opened her

  however. The wings are large, so large they are actually a
  burden. Placing the doll inside the mermaid tail is not easy for
  little hands either. All in all, this doll is just "make-up" if
  you see what I mean. Pretty but not easy to play with, and easily

  <Text category="health">I got the Fusion razor in the mail a few weeks
  ago so I decided to give it a try. At first it seemed ok, but I
  started noticing that it pulled at the hair on my face more than
  my Mach 3 turbo. I decided to experiment and shave half of my
  face with a Mach 3 Turbo and the other half with the Fusion. From
  my experience, the Mach 3 Turbo gave a closer shave, and glided
  much smoother across my skin than the Fusion. I think the 5
  blades on the Fusion are more of a gimmick than anything else.
  And as cool as the single trimming blade is, it seems like
  Gillette had to include this because of the poor accuracy of
  having 5 blades. In other words, the single blade is a fix rather
  than a feature. My call is if your using a Mach 3 Turbo, don't
  waste your money on the Fusion</Text>

  <Text category="toys_games">My son's best friend got one of those for
  christmas and we went to the lake to test it against my son's
  regular RC boat. The hovercraft was very slow and not quite that
  maneuverable. It hovered OK on water, but couldn't handle sand or
  concrete. The "skirt" slipped out of its track a couple times
  (despite our being careful fitting it as best as we could),
  filling with water - the foam inside it didn't prevent the boat
  from being swamped by the smallest wave (even in good shape it
  couldn't handle waves like the other boat.) The thin skirt
  finally ripped and the boat is pretty much unusable now. Big
  disapointment. It was somewhat fun while it worked, the concept
  was intriguing for the gearhead boys, but once the novelty wore
  off the regular boat was a lot more exciting and all the kids
  prefered taking turns running that one.</Text>
  <Text category="book">Two of the worst stories in the history of
  TOS, but for different reasons. The 'Way to Eden' makes the
  mistake of trying to be trendy, and so dates badly. What the real
  problem is though is that it makes the Enterprise crew seem to be
  the disapproving establishment, especially of all people Captain
  Kirk. 'Requiem for Methuselah' is at heart a reasonable story
  with the assertion that one man could be responsible for the work
  of Da Vinci, Brahms and others. What it completely fails to do is
  have any appreciation for Kirk's relationships with women. Threre
  is no way any woman would have Kirk obsessed to the point he
  would fight for her, he is far to full of his own importance for
  that. This effectively trashes any credibility that the story
  would have had because this is the crux of the whole episode. A
  real pity</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This game is very difficult and lengthy to

  For 30.00 they could have at least put a larger database of

  whole thing. your pupil is just going back to its smaller,
  regular size and it makes the picture look like it's getting
  smaller. and the one with the magic cards is rediculous. anyone
  can see that all you have to do is choose the cards that you can

  only go on 2 at a time. It got 3 holes which I patched. They even
  took naps in it. I must of had It for about 6 months and only
  keep it up for like a week at a time. My problem was it was hard
  to store. I had to leave it inflated some and pushed it in back
  of my closet. Finaly one of the big kid did a big belly flop on
  it and popped the seem. No way was that fixable. If I ever find
  it on clearance again I would buy it but not for what they are
  asking for it. Not worth it if it will break in a couple of

  extremely difficult for our kids to load and they almost always

  down the dominos the old fashioned way. I grew up in the "Domino
  Rally" days and compared to the original toys, these don't stack
  up. The truck and tower just aren't worth it, you are better off
  buying a bag of dominoes and letting your kids make their own
  domino trails</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">First of all, who was the spastic genius who
  decided that concert films had to change camera angles every five
  seconds? This is terribly anoying, especially when every third
  shot is of the same audience members. This may be fun for a home
  video, but not for a mass marketed commercial release. The Dance
  Hall Crashers are an awesome band. Much of the fun of seeing the
  DHC in concert is their highly kinetic stage presence. It would
  have been great if this DVD had concentrated on the band as a
  whole and not just different extreme closeups switched at a
  dizzying rate. And since the DHC are supposed to be the focus,
  why does the director insist on featuring so many shots of the
  audience? It gets on your nerves. I love the DHC. Their live CD
  has a permanent place on my playlist. But this horribly made DVD
  only made it through three songs. Perhaps if I had been at the
  front of the stage that night, I would appreciate it more.</Text>
  <Text category="health">I bought this shaver last September, and at
  that point I agreed with the other reviewers. It delivered a

  it stopped being able to re-charge and just died completely. I
  only used the recommended cleaning solution, changed it according
  to the instructions, and cleaned it after every use. I sent the
  shaver back to Remington, they were very nice and sent a new
  replacement shaver after a few weeks. It worked wonderfully, for
  about 2 months when the same problem occurred again! I'm sending
  it back again and hoping for a refund this time, it isn't worth
  my time and money to go to the post office every few months to
  return yet another defective shaver!</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This is one of the worst movies I have ever
  seen. The characters are unlikeable except for Charity's two
  friends. The songs are far too long and I had to fast forward
  through most of them because they were so dull. I was especially
  disappointed with Big Spender because I love the song and
  expected a spectacular dance number from Bob Fosse and all they
  did was stand there draped over the bar. The only redeeming
  factor was that Sammy Davis Jr. was in it. He's awesome even
  though the song was fairly stupid. This was my first Shirley
  MacLaine film and on the back it said that Sweet Charity was her
  best movie. I have no desire to see her other movies then</Text>
  <Text category="music">Remember the days when we were punks and we'd
  gather 'round the phonograph and listen to some Puccini on the
  old Edison cylinders? They held up to 4 minutes of music! Count
  'em, 4 minutes! Then that hippie opera singer Enrico Caruso came
  along and all the young punks would listen to him, including
  myself. He was quite the singer. When I was a young kid though,
  the only form of music we had were the concerts. I remember
  seeing Franz Liszt play the piano in concert, quite an amazing
  virtuoso, and Johann Strauss Jr. conducting his orchestra, those
  were the days. Then they came out with those things called
  grammophones, which were even more modern, if it was even
  possible. But it was, because then they came out with a new
  modified version of the phonograph that all the young punks would
  listen to, lazy kids. I mean, you didn't even have to crank a
  handle like you had to with grammophones. And what's this, 1
  hour, a full 60 minutes of music, on 1 record? Pshaw! 4 minutes
  of music was all I needed, and I was still pooped out even after
  that. In my day, it was bed at 4 p.m., breakfast at 2 a.m., then
  off to the mines. We didn't have 60 minutes of free time. I have
  no idea what form of music they have now. Appearently, they came
  out with a couple other things after the phonograph. Now all I
  see these days are kids with their fancy eye-pods (?) and MP3,
  MP4 players, whatever they're called, listening to that "hip-hop"
  tomfoolery of theirs. You can't even call it music, it's just
  noise. Well, gotta get ready for bed now, it's almost 3:45</Text>

  long to set the game up as it does to take it. There are also
  some sketchy directions such as rolling the dice but not having
  to go as far as the die say but you can't go over that numbers
  i.e. you roll a 4 but you only want to go 3 spaces then that's
  allowed. That's confusing when you're trying to teach your kids
  their numbers and how many spaces to go but otherwise you'd be
  rolling the dice forever trying to get to the one spot you're
  trying to reach</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">I really like Bruce Campbell and his movies
  like Army of Darkness. But this movie is not in the same league.
  First of all the plot is slow and boring. Bruce does not have the
  same rouge character that he is so good at. Instead the movie is
  filled with frankly depressing scenes of him in bed or limping
  around barely able to move. This really hampers the action
  aspects of the movie. The dialogue aspect is not much better. If
  you like Bruce, my advise is to get his other movies or try to
  get a hold of the TV episodes of "Jack of all trades" episodes.
  It is a lot more fun and has the "real" Bruce</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">This DVD was the first one released by Michael
  Buble, and I bought it in hopes of seeing some of his live
  performances. There are segments of performances, but the editing
  and fast, wild cuts from one angle to the next to the next to the
  next really detract from the overall effect. The performances get
  largely lost. What remains is a LOT of footage of Michael and his
  original bandmembers drinking, clubbing, gambling, womanizing,
  and generally acting like rowdy frat boys. If you really want to
  be wowed and experience what a live Buble concert is like, I
  HIGHLY RECOMMEND "Caught in the Act". This DVD lives up to it's
  name as part of the PBS Great Performances series produced by
  David Foster. "Caught in the Act" is slick, glossy, flashy,
  enormously fun and absolutely true to the real experience. I've
  seen Buble perform live twice, and I can attest that "Caught in
  the Act" is just about as good as being there</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">When I first purchased the low-budget movie
  named "Pranks", I didn't really know what to expect. After all,
  "Pranks" is a slasher/horror movie from the 80s, a very fertile
  period for such movies and time period which quite honestly
  produced some pretty good slasher and horror movies in
  general...unfortunately, after viewing "Pranks", I can honestly
  say that this is not one of them. "Pranks" is about a group of
  college kids who are staying on campus over the holidays
  preparing a building which is going to be torn down I think
  (herein lies another problem in that it is very difficult to
  understand what is going on in this movie because the acting is
  so poor). Obviously, most kids have gone home for Christmas and
  New Year's except for this group of kids and one "weird" kid who
  ostensibly becomes the lead suspect as gruesome murders begin to
  occur. The murders remain largely unbeknownst to the characters
  in the movie, so the director and screenplay writer wanted to
  give the audience information to which the main characters are
  not privileged. The plot is decent enough although the execution
  is formulaic/generic and lacks luster throughout the film. One of
  the reasons for this is the pathetic acting we see in this movie,
  which really overshadows any kind of merit this movie is able to
  produce as a horror movie. There is no question that "Pranks" is
  a low budget production to begin with and along with that, there
  is going to be some subpar acting, but the acting in "Pranks" is
  borderline-awful!! It is this acting and poor direction that
  really makes it difficult for the tasteful horror movie viewer to
  stay interested. In fact, the movie comes off very generic in
  style and substance, and rather predictable and boring. The only
  thing that is even remotely interesting are the kills which
  aren't too bad considering the era in which this movie came out
  from. The Director does use some weak misdirection to attempt to
  keep the audience guessing as to who the killer is, but the savy
  horror movie audience can clearly identify the "weird guy" as a
  "red herring" as another reviewer put it. In summary, "Pranks" is
  a poorly executed attempt at a horror movie which suffers from
  terrible acting, extremely poor production values and flawed
  direction. The result is a dull, boring and weak horror movie
  with a few decent kills...certainly nothing to write home about.
  Also, as a final note, the actor who plays the killer does a
  terrible job and comes off, in the end at least, like a total
  wuss</Text>
  <Text category="music">This CD is boring and derivative to the point
  of being cynical. A better alternative would be to listen to
  either: a) the original artists who influenced this band or b)
  someone at least trying to do something new with music. To enjoy
  this CD you'd have to really want to like this band, either
  because you liked Dig or because you're attracted to their

  Not that he's awful, I suppose it's okay background
  music...better than nothing. Just oh so mediocre. I don't
  understand why is he so highly praised? Voice-wise? Eh. Nothing
  special. Lyrics? Hah! Music? umm... bland? it's all the same!
  Maybe I'm missing something? If you like one of Dave's songs,
  then by all means, buy this! You can be sure your money will be
  spent on nearly exact replicas of that song. Two stars because
  it's at least music. But that's on the high side, considering how
  static it is. Dave will never find a place in my cd player or in

  <Text category="dvd">Pushing the envelope for explicit, over the
  counter home videos, 9 SONGS (Tartan) is about one year of sex
  and rock'n roll in the life of two lovers. Matt is a young
  glaciologist. He meets Lisa at a London rock concert. That night
  they start an affair. In between attending more concerts, they
  make passionate love. It's for real and explicit. Nine
  live-concert song footage is intercut with their coke-snorting,
  sexual encounters creating a sometimes ironic reflection of their
  intense physical but otherwise rather bland relationship. And
  finally, all this takes place in the memory of Matt as he flies
  across the vast frozen wastelands of the South Pole. This
  unscripted film is part musical, part drama, part documentary and
  part performance. It raises questions about the difference
  between pornography and art. Controversial and much buzzed about,
  this not fully satisfying experiment is of interest mainly as a
  novelty item by a usually innovative and creative director for

  <Text category="health">I have cracked heals and a bit of a callous
  problem. They aren't dragon feet, but they do have to be softened
  pretty often. I have used the little blade scraper tool for a few
  years and that works well but when I saw the Artemis Heel
  Smoother advertised, I decided I had to try it. It's a waste of
  money. The appliance is no more than a low-tech dreml. In fact, I
  have a Dreml type tool that was marketed as a dog nail trimmer
  that works better. The Artemis appliance does NOT scrape any
  dried skin away..it merely sands your foot a bit..that is when
  you can get the darn thing to stay on the spot you put it on. It
  comes with a small container of foot conditioning balm that is
  probably just straight cocoa butter except it has a really
  offensive aroma. I would just as soon use a piece of sand paper
  than this thing. Save your money.</Text>

  <Text category="book">This book was very boring. Details in a book

  73% of the students in the school liked this book. What does that

  <Text category="music">I was so disappointed in this film. The only
  reason I gave it 2 stars is because of the heart and soul
  Terrance Howard put into his acting. I love Terrance, he is an
  outstanding actor but seeing him playing a pimp was just
  embarrassing. He did an excellent job with the acting but I would
  have much rather seen him portraying Marvin Gaye. Call me naive
  but is pimping still actually going on in Memphis, Tennessee in
  this day and time? And did Terrance Howard give Ludacris'
  character a cassette tape to listen to? Not a CD, a tape. I
  probably would have flushed it down the toilet too. And the hook
  to that song, "You know it's hard out here for a pimp." Ya think?
  With prostitution being illegal in the state of Tennessee and
  all. I found myself cringing and sliding down in my seat in the
  theatre when she began to sing because I was so embarrassed.
  Don't get me wrong, I love my black people but sometimes when we
  get a chance to make a major motion picture we just don't quite
  bring it, do we? "The Cookout" "How High?" "Girl 6" "Woo"
  "Kingdom Come" Now we can add "Hustle and Flow" to the list. I'm
  glad Terrance Howard redeemed himself in "Crash." Do yourself a
  favor and pass on this one.</Text>
  <Text category="health">I bought two of these trikes for my 19 month

  don't like them because they don't keep the roller still like the

  <Text category="book">This series is a travesty. I understand the
  feeling of loss when you finish a beloved series, but let Laura,
  not MacBride, have the last word on her family's experience. So
  much in his books rings false: the clumsy historical allusions,
  the narrative voice, the potty humor . . . One of the greatest
  things about Laura Ingalls Wilder's work is the way her voice
  advances in maturity as she, the main character, grows: Big Woods
  is written for little girls and Happy Golden Years for young
  women. MacBride doesn't manage this and talks down to readers.
  There is a tiny thread of Laura in these books, but not enough to
  do more than frustrate her fans. Sampling is for rap, not
  fiction.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">After reading the reviews on this table we

  practically in every corner and the paint rubbed off. Amazon were

  <Text category="health">The paper version is a real touchstone for the
  practice of all manner of applied mathematics. The CD-ROM version
  belongs in the discount bin. Here is why: 1) The CD-ROM is
  edition 5; but edition 6 has been out for 4 years. 2) The
  DynaText software, which is needed to read/browse/search the
  book, is showing signs of age. It works fine on the computers of
  a decade ago but not necessarily on the machines of today. See
  the review of J.F.Groote. The product is advertised as working on
  Macs but will not work on most Macs. Specifically, it does not
  seem to work on either G4 or G5 hardware with OS X, even under
  the so-called "Classic" mode. I believe that the problem is that
  the browser is shipped as an executable that requires a specific
  architecture. It is usable under Windows, but you might need to
  use one of the backwards-compatibility options to run the
  installer. It will not apparently run under any form of Linux,
  the most recent (and rapidly becoming the most popular)
  transmogrification of Unix. Again, DynaText is put on the CD-ROM
  as a binary executable; if you are not using SunOS 4 or 5,
  Solaris or SGI IRIX 5.2 then you can not use this product</Text>
  <Text category="health">I agree with the other reviews. It was a huge
  disappointment that it didn't heat the water. It is only supposed
  to maintain the temperature, but after using it for about 20
  minutes, it didn't even do that. The manual rollers hurt my feet
  and it sloshes water around and spills it when you move your feet
  back and forth. Back to the store indeed</Text>
  <Text category="health">I was overwhelmed by the choices, and selected
  this model, in part, because of the reasonal price. I had read
  reviews which mentioned problems and the need to return the
  product, but I decided there was only a small possibility of that
  happening. The instructions said to use the lowest setting
  initially, which certainly made sense. However, the INSTRUCTIONS
  said to move the adjustment "toward the tip", which turned out to
  be the highest, not the lowest setting! The diagram on the handle
  indicated that the movement was toward the LARGER opening, but I
  read the directions and did not look at the diagram until later.
  The spray was very powerful and actually "hurt", especially when
  it was by my tooth with a crown. The next day I tried adjusting
  the settings with the pik over my sink, not in my mouth! It felt
  wonderful on the lower setting! I reread the directions again
  (and again over the next several days) to see if the error was
  mine or theirs. I still think the directions were not written
  properly. The third day I had trouble getting any spray at all.
  This continued for about a week, some days getting more or less,
  but never a full spray ON ANY SETTING! My guess is that it was in
  a permanent "pause" mode. I gave up and pursued returning the
  item. It needed to be returned to an "authorized repair", which
  luckily was only a few miles away (there were only three in my
  state). The repair man had told me, over the phone, it was a
  discontinued model and hadn't been made in about a year. When he
  looked at it, he found it had been made in 2006. He said he could
  fix it, but wasn't allowed to; I am awaiting a replacement to
  arrive in the mail.</Text>

  <Text category="toys_games">My 3 year old daughter and I have no problem
  making good size bubbles with this wand. The design is nice, it
  snap back easily for storage and the color is nice. However,
  after using it twice, the plastic hoop at the snapping piece and
  the stick is twisted. This makes the hoop to be wailing back and
  forth even though it was snap in place. It makes the wand
  impossible to make bubble by waving. My daughter was frustrated.
  I eventually went with some cheap plactic wands that do not have
  the fancy mechanism and they are extremely durable with many

  Christian-bashing out of Hollywood? The man has suffered enough

  <Text category="book">The author makes a couple of valuable points.
  First, any long-term investment strategy has to take into account
  the existence of recurrent "secular" (i.e., indefinitely long)
  bear markets. Most leading investment advisors recommend a "buy
  and hold" strategy, but this only works during predominately bull
  market periods. Most studies of successful investment strategies
  are biased towards the recent 1982-1999 bull market, which is
  anomalous in historical terms. The author uses a plethora of
  graphs and charts to prove that "buy and hold" doesn't always
  provide the best returns. Obviously, then, it's better to pull
  out during the bear markets, but that's easier said than done.
  The author provides a very complete analysis of the
  characteristics of bear markets, including P/E ratio, interest
  and inflation rates, and GDP. The problem is that those
  characteristics don't always correlate with market performance.
  For example, this book was written in 2004 and the author
  predicted a bear market. Well, if you heeded his advice, you
  would have missed the bull market of 2004, 2005 and early 2006,
  especially in small-mid caps and foreign stocks. Even with high
  P/E ratios, a bull market can continue for several years: witness
  the late 90s. It's virtually impossible to time the market even
  if you monitor the major stock indexes on a daily basis. There is
  so much volatility on a daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly basis
  that's it's impossible to know when the market has switched
  directions. By the time that it is apparent, it's too late to
  profit. Even in the midst of great bull markets, there might be
  week, month, or even year-long downturns. The author says nothing
  about individual stock picking, beyond a general value approach.
  The book is all about big picture, long term trends. Another
  problem is that the author's predictions are based on his
  analysis of market trends going back to 1900. But the market (and
  economy) is a different beast now that it was in the 40s, 50s,
  60s, and 70s. As they say, past performance does not predict
  future returns. The investment advice provided here is not
  useful. He suggests a "portfolio of hedge funds," ignoring the
  fact that most hedge funds require a minimum deposit of 500K. He
  also recommends a "bond ladder," an approach which can be easily
  replicated with a good bond mutual fund, and frequent rebalancing
  of your portfolio asset allocations. I don't need to spend $25
  and five hours reading to learn that! One thing I did learn from
  this book is the impact of volatility, which is often ignored in
  investment strategy recommendations. Volatility cuts into returns
  in ways that most studies do not account for. Most studies just
  average the returns across years, but that doesn't reflect real
  returns. Let's say you invest $100k into a stock that returns 35%
  the first year and -15% the second. Your average return should be
  10% a year, right? Wrong. At the end of the first year you have
  135k. Minus 15% the second year leaves you with 115k total, equal
  to 7% a year compounded. If you had received 10% a year
  compounded, your final total would be over 121k. That's 6k
  difference in just 2 years, and the volatility costs add up. The
  book is very poorly written, plodding, sooooo boring, with tons
  of repetition. Just as an example, the graph showing the "Y
  curve" relationship between P/E ratio and inflation is repeated
  no less than 3 times.</Text>
  <Text category="book">I can't give this book more than two stars,
  and that's being generous. Mr. Hall does present some interesting
  ideas, but unfortunately, his editors have done him a huge
  disservice. Here are the first three sentences of Stage I, on
  page 23; Essentially what we have now--nanoscale science and
  technology--including the ability to image at the atomic scale
  with scanning probe microscopes, and a very limited ability to
  manipulate, that is, by pushing things around with the same
  scanning probes. A scanning probe is essentially like feeling
  something with a stick. Because you have a computer behind it,
  you can touch it in a very close grid of points and produce a
  picture. I made it through the first fifty pages, and it didn't
  get any better. I don't know if Mr. Hall had a final read before
  publication, or not, but someone should have stopped this book
  from being published until it was properly edited.</Text>
  <Text category="music">First they started out as nu-metal, then they
  moved onto metalcore, and now psuedo-death metal. It should be no
  surprise to the fools who listen to this garbage that they are
  clearly following trends, and after each trend dies, they just
  move on to another one. If my calculations are correct, expect a
  psuedo-black metal release. But, what about the musicians? Sure,
  they have a fast drummer...who likes to trigger alot, then they
  have two guitarists...who like to steal Pantera riffs, and then
  they have the singer, who, well, sounds just like all the rest.
  Atleast they dont have the DJ anymore (oh wait, they do,

  <Text category="music">I had the privilege of attending recitals of

  from this CD and I must agree that Mr. Winston did attempt to
  capture Mr. Guaraldi's timeless expressions, but the this

  <Text category="book">Let's face it--if you want to get a
  non-fiction self help type book published and sold today, you
  better have a completely original idea--or make it controversial
  and provacative. I would hope that Ms. Bennetts' opinions are
  written for this purpose since they are so extreme. I am a
  college educated stay at home mom of two small boys. I am proud
  to be doing that and to be defering to my husband to support
  me/us financially in this mutual decision. I feel it's a personal
  decision to stay home and try not to be judgemental of others,
  but to me there is no career worth giving up taking them and
  picking them up from school everyday, helping in their class,
  having simple chats after school, and most important being very
  present in their young lives. Does that mean I'm sitting back
  fat, dumb and happy, expecting 100% to live the fairy tale so I
  can turn stupid and dependent on him for my every need? Of course
  not. Our relationship is solid, his job is as stable as one can
  be, we have good life insurance and a lot of it. Here's an
  important one--we live within our means! We don't have two leased
  cars and a house we can't afford. In addition, while I have
  "given up" my career to raise my kids full time, I have a lot of
  skills, drive, and no doubt that in that worst case scenario I
  could provide an income when and if I need to. I CERTAINLY would
  hope no one would give up the opportunity to stay home because of
  these so called realistic fears. Look, if you want to be a
  working mom by choice--knock yourself out. But don't look for
  excuses to justify it to yourself and others by saying you're
  doing it in case of the worst. THAT would be a bigger "feminine"

  <Text category="book">I found this book at a thrift store for 25
  cents. I flipped though it and it looked dated, but interesting,
  so I decided to get it. As other reviewers mention, it is dated
  -- but you gotta know that up front when you get it. It's
  published in 1986, when there were no (well, almost no) home
  computers. So you have to accept up front that it's talking about
  organizing papers using more papers -- but that's something we
  still all got to do occasionally. So it's a system of notepads,
  file folders, etc. It does help you try to understand why you
  want to keep papers, etc, and what you can do about it. However,
  it does get overly complex, and really doesn't seem applicable in
  today's world, where there are far fewer "homemakers" who spend
  time organizing sewing and recipe files, as this book seems to be
  focused on. Finally, I have to mention that it was the continual
  religion-related references that put me off to the book in the
  end. Others who are comfortable with this may not even notice it,
  but for me, I felt I was being preached to a bit too much to find
  it tolerable. Just my personal taste; I'm sure some others will
  disagree with this judgement, but I have to admit after enough
  casual religion references tossed randomly throughout the text, I
  gave up on the book and put it in the recycle bin</Text>

  <Text category="book">I will not lash out against anyone, and I will
  not use specific names of individuals or organizations that
  replace the search for truth with a situationist relativism based
  on vainglorious, ostentatious egotism. That said, let me merely
  point out that the absence of necessary historiographical context
  makes Jesus of Nathareth's solutions extremely difficult to
  accept. First off, it doesn't do us much good to become angry and
  wave our arms and shout about the evils of Jesus's morals in
  general terms. If we want other people to agree with us and join
  forces with us, then we must provide a trenchant analysis of
  Jesus's codices. The key point here is that Jesus's older
  analects were deluded enough. His latest ones are undoubtedly
  beyond the pale. Jesus's peuplade appears to be growing in
  number. I indisputably pray that this is analogous to the
  flare-up of a candle just before extinction yet I keep reminding
  myself that Jesus has found a way to avoid compliance with
  government regulations, circumvent any further litigation, and
  violate his pledge not to condemn innocent people to death -- all
  by trumping up a phony emergency. His desire to control your bank
  account, your employment, your personal safety, and your mind is
  the chief sign that he's a slaphappy caitiff. (The second sign is
  that Jesus feels obliged to force me to undergo "treatment" to
  cure my "problem".) Perhaps I'm reading too much into Jesus's
  ravings, but they don't seem to serve any purpose other than to
  destroy the natural beauty of our parks and forests. Jesus's
  prï¿½cis are Pyrrhonism cloaked in the rhetoric of
  truculent, noxious feudalism. That's pretty transparent. What's
  not so transparent is the answer to the following question: Does
  Jesus's oversized ego demand that he condone illegal activities?
  A clue might be that every time he tries, Jesus gets increasingly
  successful in his attempts to have a serious destabilizing effect
  on our institutions. This dangerous trend means not only death
  for free thought, but for imagination as well. Jesus's
  eccentricity is surpassed only by his vanity. And his vanity is
  surpassed only by his empty theorizing. (Remember his theory that
  the cure for evil is more evil?) Jesus of Nathareth has an agenda
  -- a political, social, and cultural agenda. And that's all I
  have to say.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Mortal Kombat: Annihilation is one of those
  films that is so bad that it actually HURTS to watch it. From the
  nearly complete recast of almost all of the characters (odd,
  considering that in interviews after the first movie, all of them
  said they'd want/ be willing to come back for a sequel), to the
  horrible (even by 1997 standards) CG effects, to the cliched
  fight scenes (gee...two women in a mud pit. I bet it took them
  all night to come up with that one), virtually everything that
  could have gone wrong with this movie DID go wrong with this
  movie. Loosely based on the story of the Mortal Kombat 3 video
  game (and set immediately after the first movie, which, while not
  great, looks like Citizen Kane compared to this stinkburger), the
  movie set about the lofty goal of depicting Shao Khan (played by
  Brian Thompson, the alien bounty hunter from The X-Files) and his
  army (shown in most scenes as a small band of extras.
  Oooh...scary.) as they attempt to take over Earth by merging it
  with the alternate dimension known as Outworld. This merging of
  realms will result in the destruction of humanity. With only a
  week to do anything about it, Lord Raiden (played by James Remar,
  replacing the, and I can't believe I'm saying this, much better
  Christopher Lambert in the role) once again enlists the help of
  Liu Kang (Robin Shou), Sonia Blade (Sandra Hess), and Princess
  Kitana (Talisa Soto), along with help from a select few other
  characters from the video games' crowded lineup, to prevent this
  from happening. The story in and of itself is not necessarily
  bad. However, given the film's obviously low budget the weak
  screenplay, the loss of most of the excellent cast from the first
  film, and most jarringly, direction even more inept than that of
  Paul W.S. Anderson, it quickly becomes clear that they set their
  sights too high, only to have practically everything come
  crashing down. The only saving grace of this film is its killer
  soundtrack, featuring an updated version of the theme created for
  the first movie, as well as music by KMFDM, Megadeth, Rammstein,
  Juno Reactor, and others. If ever you're looking to punish
  yourself for something, then by all means watch this movie.
  However, if you actually like yourself and want to remain on good
  terms with yourself, you will avoid this movie like the plague.
  Believe me, you'll thank yourself later.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">When the lead character acts like she's
  sleepwalking through the entire film, that's distracting! When
  just about anyone from my high school's drama class could do a
  much better job while brushing their teeth, then it's time to
  open up the wallet, and hire better talent. Once you get past the
  special affects, all which use cheesy models, this godforsaken
  movie is boring as sin, or, should I say mud! Beside being
  preposterous, for example, the meteroid, or whatever, ONLY hits a
  dam in its first strike, this pitiful film is also delusional!
  Remember the scene where the head of FEMA risks his life to save
  someone who is obviously in danger of being wiped out by fire. As
  Hurricane Katrinia proves, there is no such thing as a
  bureaucratic, administrator hero! Instead, this movie comes off
  as a piece of not-so-subtle Federal government propaganda not
  worthy of a moment of your time</Text>

  <Text category="music">I bought Usher's 8701 on tape long ago, and I
  remember liking it. Then a couple of years ago, I bought it again
  on cd, listened to it, and wondered why I wasted my money. Maybe
  it's the fact that I've grown, but this album sounds so
  un-soulful now. It is just lacking any spirit, sort of like an
  over-produced record: all studio magic, but no magic from the
  singer. Even the songs that are SUPPOSED to sound heartfelt,
  don't. The album sounds dated, not transcendent of time and era
  like all the albums that become classics. The songs are very
  forgettable, and I don't see any of them being seen as classics
  twenty years from now. Usher has yet to make a masterpiece.
  Addendum: I was a little unfair in my rating. The album deserves
  3 stars, not 2. Unfortunately, I can't change it.</Text>
  <Text category="book">Ernest Hemingway dies on page 161 of this
  300-page book and so does author Valerie Hemingway's story. For
  that reason this book merits only two stars. Early in her story
  of meeting Hemingway in Spain in 1959 at age 19, Valerie is aware
  of the author's magnetic and dominant personality, "Around him
  everything came to life....There was an urgency and vitality
  that...did not ebb." When she stays focused on the story of
  Ernest Hemingway, this is an endearing look at the older,
  struggling Hemingway finding temporary renewal in the freshness
  of an innocent Irish girl who entered his life during the final
  drafts of "A Moveable Feast." But the youthful time spent with
  the famous writer works against this memoir since she was clearly
  neither as dedicated a correspondent or note taker as her
  subject. As a result, her recollections are thin and easily
  available in other sources such as A. E. Hotchner's "Papa
  Hemingway." The two years she spent living and traveling with
  Hemingway through Spain, Paris, Key West, Cuba, and America,
  share as much space as her weird marriage with Hemingway's
  strange son, Gregory (apparently the other "bull" referred to in
  the title). It shows the continuing vitality of Ernest Hemingway
  - even in death and over 40 years later - that a Valerie
  Hemingway can find a book deal for her meager remembrances of
  such a great man</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">My daughter was shown this movie in her public
  school classroom several times while she was in grade school. It
  wasn't until years later that I saw it, and I was HORRIFIED!!!
  This was a movie aimed at children??? What does a children's
  movie need a sexy bunny for? The lead female character was a very
  sexy bunny wearing skimpy clothing and "strutting her stuff" on
  the basketball court in a very provocative manner, until the male
  characters were panting, drooling, and clawing their way after
  her like a bunch of sick, depraved perverts. This scene was
  highly innapropriate for children, and is NOT the idea of
  womanhood that should be shown to boys or girls. Not only that,
  the idea was put forward that only a fortune teller with a
  crystal ball was able to discern the truth about what happened to
  the players abilities. This movie should be kept far, far away
  from children, and was truly deserving of zero stars</Text>

  <Text category="book">I am a Jane Austen fan. I love Pride and
  Prejudice and there are three very good to marvelous adaptations
  of that great novel. However, Mansfield Park is Jane Austen's
  most complex and serious novel, and on the whole it is my
  favorite. Fanny Price is the most difficult of the Jane Austen
  heroines, not the wittiest or most beautiful, but the one who
  knows the difference between right and wrong. She is mentored by
  her uncle, the righteous and honorable [and I don't use the terms
  loosely] Sir Thomas Bertram. Somehow, the adaptation of this
  great novel has twisted Sir Thomas into a sadistic, sexual
  pervert. Moreover, Fanny is constantly babbling to us in Jane
  Austen quips that are not part of this novel. They simply missed
  the point of the book. The acting is okay. The settings are okay.
  The directing is sad. But the sense of disappointment and
  betrayal by perverting the essential theme of the book has left a
  very sour taste</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">OK, I know I'm going to get hammered for this;
  once again, there goes my reviewer rating. But I just HAVE to be
  honest: this is a terrible story. OK, being that it's
  Shakespeare, it's prettily told, but it's still a HORRIBLE story,
  and I can't imagine why otherwise sensible people like it.
  Perhaps they feel that Shakespeare is telling it tongue-in-cheek
  (it IS a comedy, after all) and poking fun at the system of
  fathers marrying off their daughters without any concern for
  whether they want it or not; that would almost make it tolerable,
  if I could believe it. But given that it IS a Shakespearean
  comedy, we must assume that the ending is supposed to be a
  "happy" one, and the situation at the end is far from pleasant.
  Or perhaps people believe (I've heard this claimed in all
  seriousness) that Kate has actually "triumphed" at the end,
  having figured out how to manipulate Petruchio so as to get her
  way subtly and underhandedly. Even if this were true, I'd hardly
  consider it a "happy" anding, and personally, I see little
  evidence of it. No, what we actually have here is a story of a
  strong woman (some people seem to like it simply because there IS
  a strong woman to be found in it) being married against her will
  to a scheming golddigger who "Tames" her by blatent if indirect
  spousal abuse (he doesn't beat her, simply starves her and
  sleep-deprives her, as well as forcing her to wear muddy rags
  until she behaves exactly as he wants, up to and including
  winning him a bet by lecturing her contemporaries on their duties
  as obedient wives. Her spirit may or may not be broken, depending
  on how the part is played, but the fact remains that she's forced
  to BEHAVE as if it is, and that's not a message that should be
  bruited about in a "comedy". This is absolutely the WORST of
  Shakespeare's plays</Text>

  <Text category="music">Having been a fan of Joan Osborne's take of
  "Son of a Preacher Man" on her original indie record and "Heat
  Wave" from the recent 'Standing in the Shadows of Motown'
  soundtrack, I was looking forward to hearing this record of
  covers. I was ultimately disappointed. First of all, I have to
  say, there are two real gems on here that really needed to be
  updated, one for its amazing vocal/instrumental sound (The
  Spinners' "I'll Be There") and the other for its message (Timmy
  Thomas' "Why Can't We Live Together"). To be sure, there are some
  great tunes on here that I am always up for listening to, such as
  Stevie Wonder's "Love's In Need of Love Today" and Undisputed
  Truth's "Smiling Faces Somtimes", but Osborne adds little to
  these. When she does change things around, the effect is
  questionable. I know that Norah Jones has brought back the torch
  song style, but Osborne's bluesy take on Edwin Starr's "War" is
  seriously misguided. The same is true when you rip the melody and
  add bland vocals to classics like Aretha Franklin's "Think" or
  The Band's "The Weight" - especially since the former could have
  really used some punch from such a powerful singer like Osborne.
  Overall, this was a missed opportunity. I hope her upcoming 2005
  record is a reinvention</Text>
  <Text category="music">First Bill has never nor will he ever be a
  jazz musician. It seems that those who branch out and play
  multiple styles are often lauded for expanding the vocabulary.
  Here's what chaps my hide the most. Bill has somehow captured the
  attention of hordes of budding guitarist with their effect pedals
  all strung out as if they were getting ready for a space shuttle
  launch. It burns me too no end when a person calls himself a
  &amp;amp;quot;jazz&amp;amp;quot; guitarist, but doesn't really
  have any chops. I know Bill has been called anti-technique, but
  what does that really mean? Would you want a heart transplant
  performed by a surgeon that means well, but really isn't very
  good at what he/she does? This guy is getting built up as
  something new and it seems every time I turn around someone that
  knows absolutely nothing about jazz guitar is throwing this guy
  in my face. I've been a professional jazz guitarist for 12 years
  and teaching for 8 years. When I have guys that actually debate
  me that Bill is somehow doing more interesting things than say
  Pat Martino, or that Bill could somehow hang in a jam session
  with someone like Pat Martino, I have to shake my head in
  disbelief in how twisted and mixed up this world has become when
  charlatans are giving more credit than someone like Pat who has
  been on the road for years and paid dues that Frisell couldn't
  imagine. Is Bill Frisell a Jazz musician, No! Maybe if the guy
  could woodshed for a dozen years he'd come up with something. For
  me I'll stick with the guys that really know how to
  play......Johnny Smith, Peter Leitch, Jim Hall, Pat Martino,
  Kenny Burrell, Billy Bauer, Tal Farlow, Lenny Breau, Jimmy Bruno,
  Jimmy Raney, Wes Montgomery and so on</Text>

  <Text category="toys_games">My son loved this tent. He fit perfectly in it
  and it fits inside his crib so he can sleep in his tent. My only
  beef with it is that somehow he's bent the frame of it so now it
  doesn't sit right on the floor. Actually it doesn't sit on the
  floor at all because of where it's bent. The tent would be better
  made if there were a floor to it and some support (similar to
  what keeps the top portion rigid) at the base of it to keep the
  "legs" (there aren't any but that's the best way to describe
  them) apart. The tent would also be better constructed if it
  didn't have one continuous wire for the frame on each side. If
  the wire gets bent there's no getting it back into its original
  shape, unless you take out the stitching (around the WHOLE tent
  frame) and repair it then restitch it, but who has that kind of
  time? Overall it's a fun toy for a little one but not a well

  <Text category="book">"The Other Boleyn Girl" and "The Queen's Fool"
  are two of the best books I've ever read--and I've read a LOT of
  books, especially about this period, which especially fascinates
  me. They were gripping to the end, and my involvement with the
  characters was complete--true masterpieces. So whenever a new
  book by Philippa Gregory comes out, I buy it, hoping to have the
  same experience, and lately have been sorely disappointed. "The
  Virgin's Lover" fell flat, and now I am trying to read this book
  but not finding myself engaged, must give it up. One reviewer
  suggested the books were being written too quickly--that is
  always an easy guess, however it depends on the writer. Anthony
  Trollope, for instance, was able to turn out amazing book after
  amazing book with incredible speed. That may or may not be the
  case with Gregory. I know, as a writer myself, that there are
  times when the work flows out, feeling almost as if it's
  channeled from another source, and times when it's harder, more
  mechanical. The more challenging situations are those when I'm
  not entirely convinced or in love with my subject. So to me,
  neither of these books feels as if they spring from a natural
  impulse. They feel forced, constructed. I'm going back to
  Trollope</Text>

  <Text category="book">Ethan Mordden's editors have allowed him to
  ruin what could possibly have been a good book. This is the worst
  of his books on the various decades of the Broadway musical as
  the faults of the seventies book have widened into gulfs. His
  political ramblings (often just slightly right of Ann Coulter and
  making as much sense) seep through the book, dragging it down.
  The French people are slammed a number of times, along with the
  ACLU, Burt Lancaster (apparently, according to Ethan a good
  friend of Stalin) and the left in general, while the author
  defends Bush (and it does take some looking back over the page to
  figure out how he fits all this into a book on musical theatre).
  The author's train of thought wanders like a bitter old man all
  over the page in search of a target, any target. It is often hard
  to stomach. The truly sad fact about this is that the author
  often has quite cogent things to say about a particular musical
  and when he does stick to that, it can actually make one want to
  look at the work again. An editor should have cleaned the work up

  <Text category="music">The Schumann that is presented here is a
  forgery. Don't get me wrong. I'm not railing against Schumann at
  all. The question here is what makes Schumann great, and the way
  that Bernstein presents these symphonies says Schumann is great
  for the wrong reasons. The real Schumann that lived was a
  completely different person than what we might assume from
  listening to this particular presentation of his music. Schumann
  was not a hopeless romantic. He was one composer in a long line
  of "classicists" which ended with Brahms, yet at the same time he
  was an innovator, pushing forward, trying to find new stylistic
  and technical means of expression. He had plenty of dignity, and
  he didn't write his music as a desperate plea for the world to
  like him, which is exactly what it sounds like here. Bernstein
  trudges through these fine works as if he were dying. Yes, many
  of these performances are the slowest on record, but this is a
  BAD thing. These beautiful works lose value immeasurably when
  they are saturated with thick, waxy, overly romantic textures and
  phrasing. Tell me, did Schumann ever write: "To be played
  extremely histrionically and melodramatically, with the greatest
  possible amount of cheese and theatrics" in his score? No! HE DID
  NOT. These performances are not more expressive than others in
  the real sense of the word, and any person in his/her right mind
  should be able to see this. You may be able to hear the
  orchestration more clearly than in Karajan's filth, but that's
  not saying much at all. And for this slight favor Bernstein does
  for the music, he makes it infinitely worse when he stretches the
  fabric of these works beyond their limit. The most blatant
  example is the third movement of the second symphony, taken at
  half tempo. All semblance of melody and motion is lost. This
  movement is supposed to be several minutes shorter than the
  first, and not the longest movement of the symphony, not to
  mention the longest movement in the entire set. In fact, almost
  every movement of every symphony could stand to have at least a
  minute hacked off of its timing. Also, while looking at the
  scores, you might notice that Bernstein does away with detail
  work this time around. Carefully laid out phrasing and the
  dynamic arch are thrown out of the window in favor of grand
  "romantic" gestures. Observing details in Schumann, ironically,
  helps to make the music speak more freely and honestly. This
  isn't honest music-making here, only a self-indulgent conductor
  once again plastering his image over the face of great art</Text>

  <Text category="health">I was pretty excited to try an ION hairdryer.
  I got this one because I liked the idea of being able to
  'control' the amount of ions coming out. My hair DID seem a
  little shinier after using it (the only reason I gave it two
  stars and not one) but my hair felt a little drier. Almost
  straw-ish...it never felt like that with my old drier. Also the
  buttons really are hard to switch...all of them! I read another
  review that said that and I thought well how bad can it be? I dry
  my hair with a round brush in my right hand and the dryer in the
  left. I turn the dryer on and off during different times while I
  am doing my hair. With this dryer I could NOT turn the on/off
  switch with my left hand. I had to put down my brush and use both
  hands. I could not believe how hard it was to switch! This was
  the main deciding factor in returning the dryer, it was SO
  frustrating not to be able to switch it easily with a flick of
  your thumb. Not to mention made me feel like a big wussy!!! The
  speed setting only has two settings, low and high. The low
  setting was way too low and the high setting was way too high. A
  middle ground would have been nice. Lastly, the dryer smelled a
  little weird. Granted, I only had it two days before I returned
  it, so the smell might eventually disappear. But it wasn't your
  normal 'new hairdryer, hot plastic' smell. It was almost a slight
  mildew smell. Yuk. So, I would NOT recommend getting it. I
  exchanged it for the Vidal Sassoon ion sensor dryer. That seems
  to be working better. The low speed setting is perfect. The smell
  is normal 'new dryer' smell so far. The buttons are EASY to
  push!!!! The sensor (it automatically turns off when you pur it
  down) is a little off, it takes a while to turn off. But all in
  all I like it. And it also DOES make my hair shiny and DOES NOT
  make it feel drier or like straw!</Text>

  surely the worst version i've ever heard and this is all down to
  JOrma Kaukonen's nasal vocal and mediocre guitar soloing. The guy
  maybe a great acoustic picker but his lead work leaves a lot to
  be desired and this is from someone who had to endure his
  interminably uninspired lead work at a Hot Tuna gig. Anyone who
  saw the clip in Woodstock will know what i mean..No wonder
  Hendrix's set was so eagerly awaited!Occasionally the band get it
  together and Balin and Slick's vocals mesh together brilliant,
  but on the whole the set is an endurance test and the studio
  versions are far more immediate. Face it when it comes down to it
  very few West Coast bands could stretch out and reach the heights
  of say Cream or Ten years after. As i said Casady is per usual on
  form but the drumming is fairly pedestrian throughout lacking the
  kick that could push the jams into another gear. It's better than
  'thirty seconds' but then again anything is. If you think that
  'happy trails' and 'live dead' are musical highpoints than this
  will complete the set, but i just think its sleep inducing</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">The pedometer arrive held prisoner in a
  difficult-to-open plastic cell -- what are these "packaging
  engineers" thinking? It took me ten minutes and two ruined
  fingernails to open it, and then I took the scissors to it, and
  the hard packaging almost broke them! But I was thrilled. A
  handsome object, thought I, and I loved the clip in the back that
  you pinch to open. So much better than having to wrestle it down
  over a soft waistband. I yanked out the plastic battery protector
  and set to work to rev the thing up to speed. But, alas, it would
  not follow instructions as they were written. "Press and hold the
  Set button. Hour display blinking." (Could they not have said,
  "The hour display will blink"? I pressed. "Press Memory button to
  adjust the hour." I did. The Memory button never did a thing. So
  I asked a friend of mine to try and he had no luck either. We
  both tried several combinations of maneuvers, but nothing worked.
  To this moment, the hour display is blinking, blinking, blinking.
  I'd like to get my money back, but ya know what? J &amp;amp; R
  Music &amp;amp; Computer World in NY demand such a rigamarole to
  send it back, including with all the original packaging (I threw
  the OP in the trash), that you almost have to be a genius in
  packaging to follow their instructions, which, of course, are not
  designed to benefit the consumer but to benefit only themselves.
  Now I'm afraid this pedometer will follow its packaging into the
  trash, while I will make sure I never order from J&amp;amp;R
  again.</Text>

  <Text category="book">This "book" is probably the worst written I've
  ever encountered. It was so flawed as to be considered
  literature. Alice Walker tries to "One-up" Harriet Beecher Stowe,
  in writing about brutality. Titles like these are weapons used in
  the Anti-Black Male agenda this society has long perpetuated. All
  the men depicted in this book are one-dimensional characters with
  absolutely no redeeming qualities worth noting. The women are
  portrayed as martyred, forlorn, pseudo-saints who have been set
  upon by beasts from hell. The only persons capable of any sort of
  humanity are exclusively women. I've learned long ago, when
  absolutes such as these are presented, a greater agenda is at
  work. There are no "real" men in this book! Only distorted
  caricatures of Black masculinity. I only found value in this book
  as a comprehensive example of sexist misandry at its worst. I
  find this title as dangerous as Hitler's "Mien Kampf", in it's
  portrayal of Black men as evil and morally destitute. Presenting
  such depictions is both dangerous and irresponsible. True, there
  are criminally abusive men in every culture. But there are also
  forthright, upstanding men as well. To present a depiction of
  such vehement imbalance and disparity, only serves to distort the
  readers view of the people being written about. Harriet Beecher
  Stowe's fictional "Uncle Tom's Cabin", sparked national outrage
  and eventually a bloody civil war. This title does no less in
  further distorting the readers perceptions of Black Men. This
  book is fiction. However,it is not presented as such. I'm sure
  the abusive incidents depicted in this book have been based upon
  actual incidents. I have no qualm about outrage at such
  abominations. However, I do have a problem when there are
  absolutely no upstanding male figures who intervene in such
  aberrations. That is what I find so unbelievable and offensive
  about this book. In my opinion, this novel does nothing to laud
  the strength of women so much as it demeans and distorts the
  readers/viewers of the people within it. I don't find it a
  testament to the strength of Black Women at all. I interpret this
  book as feminist misandry with two purposes...the further
  distortion of African-American culture and the deliberate
  depiction and denigration of the Black Male as being hopelessly
  inhuman. I'm sure Alice walker made a lot of money with this
  book. Feminist, racist extremism seems to have found a niche in
  literature. I wonder if this novel would have had the same
  accolades, were it a fictional depiction of White American Men
  brutalizing White Women. Most definitely not!!! I doubt it would
  have even found a publisher. America is comfortable reinforcing
  negative depictions of Black Men and African-American culture. My
  life as a Black man is difficult enough living as a testament and
  example against this sort of racial distortion. Whatever Ms.
  Walker's motivations were in writing this novel, I'm sure
  mercenary incentives were not discounted. This is racist,
  misandrist propaganda masquerading as literature!</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">This film starts with an event based on a true
  crime. A talk radio show host in Denver was killed by an American
  Nazi. (This event inspired the "Talk Radio" play and film.) This
  film continues with scenes from a small town in a farming region.
  No mention of their economic status; are they losing dollars and
  population, small businesses, etc. Instead we see a small group
  of white racists who abduct a black man to hunt and kill him!
  This seems too exaggerated to believe. Federal agents are aware
  of this but don't want to act yet. Their agent is sent back to
  get more information. There are groups like that in some sparsely
  settled areas. The film doesn't explain what created them. It
  shows how some politicians try to use them for votes and
  contributions. No real names, of course. The Federal agent meets
  to report to her higher ups. Then we see terrorists prepare to
  hold up a bank to raise money for their activities (based on real
  events). Most bank robberies are done by ordinary criminals who
  are not part of any group. (The FBI put an end to organized gangs
  that robbed banks in the 1940s.) This Federal agency doesn't
  interfere because they want more information on their aims (and
  their leaders). More terrorism is planned: dynamiting a
  courthouse, attacking a power station, etc. The terrorist plots
  here would keep this small group busy 24 hours a day! Kathy finds
  a secret list of "friends". This is quickly copied with a camera.
  The Federal agents need to know who this group will target so
  they can arrest them. Gary meets with the leader (who arrives in
  a helicopter!) And shows documents that say Kathy is a special
  investigator. Is Kathy being served up as a sacrifice? Gary and
  Kathy travel to Chicago, where an assassination is planned that
  will make Gary the fall guy. (Another Lee Harvey Oswald?) A
  second "lone gunman" shoots the politician in front of a
  building. Gary fails to shoot, and won't ever try this again.
  Costa-Gavras gained world fame with his 1969 film "Z". A few
  years later his film about rebels in South America was popular.
  His later films have seemed mediocre. A better story might not
  have tried to cover so many details and plots as this film does;
  better pacing could help. The threat from domestic terrorism
  still needs a good film (e.g., Timothy McVeigh). Those who gave
  this film a high rating must love the images more than the facts.
  A better film today would show the bad results from "NAFTA" and
  "Free Trade" in harming most Americans economically. But
  Hollywood would never allow a film about this "war on the middle
  class". The word `nafta' in Greek and Arabic refers to
  `petroleum'. NAFTA is a symbol for the policies designed for Big
  Oil. It is like George W. Bush calling his policy "Operation
  Iraqi Liberation".</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">So what kind of movie is this from the
  director of "I know what you did last summer?" It's basically
  another installment of the same genre with a similar set-up and
  similar function. Deep down, Venom is just another teen slasher
  movie. They rode into this film with the same
  clichï¿½d scares, a young group of teens, a psycho
  killer, and a traditional ending. So is it worth seeing? That I
  can't completely answer for you. If you like more of the same
  old, then it's probably going to be a blast. The filmmakers were
  smart enough to throw in a few thrilling moments among the
  mundane, overused plot. I found some parts to be slightly
  unpredictable, and they did a good job detailing some suspenseful
  moments near the third act of the film. The voodoo element
  allowed for some additional surprises and kept the killer from
  being simply "an unstoppable evil force." But individually, do
  the separate factors of this film combine to make a masterpiece?
  Quite frankly, in my opinion at least....no. Let's take a look at
  some of them; Acting- Well done, well directed too I might add.
  The acting is realistic to a degree, and brings us into the film.
  The actors responded (for the most part) realistically to the
  story line and I think that this was set-up nicely. The major
  issue here was the persistence in finding a gun when the killer
  is already dead, not to mention a demon child of voodoo hoodoo.
  Lighting- Dim, dark and mysterious; the lighting definitely
  amplified the mood of this film. Combined with the swamp-like
  location, I think that it sets a perfect example of what a good
  location combined with good lighting can do- make a relatively
  unattractive plot look beautiful. Special Effects- They set this
  up pretty well. A few scenes made me cringe and I felt that the
  artists working on the film definitely put their hearts into
  it...or bled them out for it. The gore wasn't excessive, but just
  right for a slasher film, and props to the director for making
  that call. My only qualm with this is that they used the standard
  Halloween "stage blood" which is just basically a thick bright
  red liquid that looks nothing like blood despite its color. A few
  of the actors squirm around in it, only to look like they're
  rolling around in pizza sauce. There are a few other tacky
  special effects, including the last major one in the film. The
  Killer- Mr. Jangles....? Enough said...sounds like a dog. I'll
  give the killer credit for being a good actor, but the portrayal
  needed a lot of work. The make-up kicked it up a notch, but the
  slow-motion style jumps and action-movie style stunts didn't do
  it justice. The man looked like an athlete and moved like
  one...not like a reincarnated being housing the souls of 13 evil
  spirits. Although I don't specifically know what that looks
  like....I'm sure they don't run like football players. So what
  overall? It's ok. Not something I'd be dying to see, and I'm glad
  that I didn't run to the theatre to catch the first showing. It
  has some good moments and some bad, but doesn't really stand out
  from any normal Hollywood production. My recommendation? It's ok.
  I'd rather go rent Containment instead; the first movie in a long
  time to completely blow my mind. It's good to know that there is
  still some talent out there somewhere and that it still filters
  into the film world now and again...</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">Just rented this dvd and was quite surprised.
  Normally, I'm a big George Clooney and Matt Damon fan. However,
  in this film, their talents were underutilized and did not make
  up for the poor script, editing, and direction which made this
  film quite dull to watch. While the idea behind the movie is
  good, it could have been more entertaing, dramatic, or
  suspensful. As another reviewer remarked, I was quite tempted to
  shut it off after 45 minutes and watch something else. But, I did
  suffer through to the end, where the film just sort of ends and

  <Text category="dvd">It's good to see that in his twilight years,
  old squinty eyes, Clint Eastwood is growing comfortable playing
  grouchy old dudes, because, well, he is a grouchy old dude. This
  movie is anemic from the beginning. Taken from a wonderful novel
  by Michael Connelly, Clint plays an old grouchy dude who's just
  gotten a new ticker because his last one gave out while chasing a
  serial killer. Run, run, run, THUD. Next, new ticker intact,
  Clint is hired to find the murderer of a cute black woman by her
  sister, another cute black woman. Oh, and CBW#2 plays the guilt
  card on Clint, because he's got his new ticker courtesy of CBW#1.
  So there's a little bit of investigative work, a little but of
  huffin' and a puffin', and finally Clint discovers who the serial
  killer is who was responsible for his first ticker giving out and
  the murder of the donor of his second ticker. Jeff Daniels plays
  a doofus that lives next door to Clint. What a stretch. Special
  warning: Clint takes off his shirt yet again in this film as he
  smooches on CBW#2. It must be in his contract or something. No
  one, and I mean, NO ONE wants to see saggy Clint with his shirt
  off. For a much, much better Clint movie, go rent

  <Text category="book">I didn't know why I chose to read this book.
  Anyway, it was disappointing, really. The book was slow, and it
  was too long for a story of its type. I mean, I think the book
  could go on without some of the parts. When I was reading it, I
  only thought of putting it down because it's making me go crazy.
  I thought the plot was shallow, but Taylor's self-conflict was
  even shallower. He kept on blaming himself about his father's
  death well then it's really his fault! He was a coward. If you
  don't believe me, go on and read about it... although you might
  get bored getting to that part because it's towards the end. And
  I hated it when this stupid conflict got in the way with his
  relationship with Denise. He was acting really immature! He
  should have at least thought about Denise but he was too selfish.
  It really sucked. And yes, I know that this is supposed to be a
  romance novel... but I kept on looking for that love factor
  althroughout the book. And what did I find? NOTHING. Oh, what a
  waste. It's like Sparks tried very hard to make the situations in
  the story seem romantic but as a reader, it didn't really capture
  the whole essence of what romantic situations should be like. If
  it hadn't been for my HRR (Home Reading Report) I wouldn't have
  finished reading this at all. I guess I'm saying this because I'm
  not into this genre. Love stories are fine but this one...

  <Text category="book">I love Peterson's Guides, but the birds of
  Mexico is severely lacking. The art certainly holds up to the
  standard set by the guides to North America, but unfortunately,
  it can only be considered complete if you tag along two other
  Peterson Guides. Perhaps a good addition if you wish to complete
  your collection of Peterson Guides, but otherwise, buy Howell's
  or Edward's Guides, both of which far outshine this guide when
  considered alone. Howell's is certainly the most complete, but
  Edward's guide is a bit handier in the field</Text>

  Stick to portably DVD player. Yes, they are very expensive, but

  <Text category="toys_games">just my opinion; but i have a hard time
  finding books to go with my 3yr old daughter's first leap pad.
  she loves maurice sendak's where the wild things are and she
  loves many of the other books that go with the leap pad that is
  for 6mo-24mo age range. i think they should have done a bit more
  research on which stories were associated with which leap pad
  system. as for the pooh bear game; i agree; way too easy here;
  this would have been perfect for the leap pad made for younger
  children, and made a more challenging one for this level. great
  idea; just not well put together</Text>
  <Text category="book">I must agree witht he reviewer who commented
  about the book being written by committee. The narrative is
  choppy and lacking not only key details, but also historical
  background. Because it's an autobiography, I don't necessarily
  think that it's fair to damn the book for being self-centered; it
  IS about him. I do feel, however, that the book needs better
  editing and a bit more self-examination. It's an okay addition to
  one's list of books about Everest expeditions - which I must
  admit, I've developed a morbid fascination with after recently
  re-reading "Into Thin Air". I wouldn't, however, use it as my
  primary source for information or impressions</Text>
  <Text category="book">The prologue of this book lead me to believe
  this was going to be a very touching love story of a woman losing
  the love of her life and finding love again. I was disappointed,
  soon after, when it turned into a gardening manual and a tale
  about ghosts, with a sort of haphazard romance thrown in the
  middle-and then even that was disappointing. I mean Graceland for
  a first date? I noticed a lot of similarities between Roz and the
  mayor in Northern Lights, and Logan and Nate from that same book.
  None of them can talk in complete sentences. And Stella, who
  comes across as this loving mother, who puts her kids before
  anything else, works from sun up to sun down and is so smug that
  she thinks the whole business is going to come crashing down
  around everybody if she isn't there to oversee everything, even
  though the place has been successful for years. There is no
  addressing the issue of moving on with her life after the death
  of her husband, she just does it. Unless, of course, it was in
  the last 50 pages which I didn't bother to read because I just
  couldn't torture myself any longer. And I'm a big fan of Roberts.
  I love her Quinn brothers books and a lot of her other work. But
  this just stunk because I could really care less who the ghost is
  going to turn out to be. I'm certainly not going to suffer
  through the last two books to find out.</Text>
  <Text category="health">Don't buy this product. I went through two

  junk that does not properly hold the handle and accessories -
  very poorly designed, Wahl should be embararssed. It did a nice
  job of trimming my beard but the attachments are so awkward to
  install and remove, the base practically useless and the trimmer
  tabs break so easily that I would have given it no stars if

  <Text category="health">This isn't what I thought it would be. The
  instructions are unclear, so I had to refer to the box to guess
  at how to install it. I finally figured it out after about 10
  minutes of fiddling with it. You have push down on the top to get
  more than a tiny bit of gel out - so it takes two hands. That
  means that once you put gel on your face, you get gel on the
  machine. I set mine machine to the hottest setting for it to feel
  warm. This must be a safety thing, but I can't imagine what the
  lower settings are for. The gel cools extremely fast, so by the
  time you apply it to your face, only the gel where you first
  apply it feels warm. I had the same machine for foam and that
  worked a lot better, but I don't use foam shaving creme anymore.

  <Text category="book">I was optimistic when I saw the title, but you
  know that old saying, "Don't judge a book by its cover." The
  author has a FEW legitimate ideas, but any google search could
  come up with the same information in greater depth and better
  accuracy. She condemns saving animals from shelters and actually
  encourages people to breed animals to increase the pet
  population. She is no more a pet lover than I am a supermodel.
  Her ideas are based solely on MONEY. Even if it encourages
  starting a puppy mill (euphemistically referred to as a dog
  breeder). Early in her book she mentions the titles of a few
  other books she recommends (I have chosen not to seek them out),
  but she says don't spend your money on them, just go to the
  library and check them out. If you insist on reading this book I
  give you the same advice. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK--CHECK IT OUT FROM
  YOUR LOCAL LIBRARY! Then do google searches to get more in-depth,
  accurate information about any of the four decent ideas she did
  have, or come back to amazon.com and find a more specific book
  that can actually be of use. Oh, and by the way, the world is

  <Text category="book">The sub-title of this book is very misleading.
  It does not contain "an action-oriented approach" to raising your
  self-esteem - unless you count sitting down with pen and paper as
  an action. The book is centered on sentence completion exercises
  where you write the beginning of a sentence at the top of a page
  ("One of the things I dislike about myself is...", "One of my
  emotions I have trouble accepting is...") and then complete the
  sentence with whatever comes to mind. For some unexplained reason
  each sentence requires its own sheet of paper; and there are a
  lot of them, so be prepared to go through a lot of paper. Sure,
  completing sentences technically counts as an "action". But if
  you're like me, "action-oriented" implies some sort of
  cognitive-behavioral therapy that gives you exercises to go out
  and do in the world, not sitting alone and writing out your
  thoughts. For someone with social anxiety the last thing I needed
  was more solitary introspection. Branden gives examples of
  breakthroughs that his patients had doing sentence completion
  with him in therapy; but alas, the practice helped me in no way.
  Your mileage may vary, but I wouldn't recommend this book to
  anyone</Text>

  character in this remake. The film critics said that, while the
  original Sabrina was about her transformation, this version was
  about Linus' transformation. But here Linus shows no
  transformation that you can really see. His explanation to
  Sabrina for his deceitful romancing at the end- "There was a
  merger, and you were in the way. No hard feelings" is very cold

  considers this thesaurus-scrubbing, self-indulgent mess of
  cliches a literary masterpiece has no sense of language and
  literature. Someone was even audacious enough to compare Pat
  Conroy to Virginia Woolf. What a joke! Woolf's writing is
  brilliant, original, and real. She cuts to the quick, whereas
  Conroy slathers his story in cloying metaphors and trite
  descriptions. One can almost see Conroy congratulating himself on
  each simile and metaphor as he writes, not caring how superfluous
  or artificial his language is -- nor how unrealistic it makes the
  story. I laughed out loud at some of the words he puts in the
  characters' mouths. In the real world, nobody is as self-concious
  and self-reflexive as the characters in this book. They do not
  speak in reams of figurative language. I cannot even get into how
  inconsistent and impossible the characters are, especially the
  children. Also, Conroy caricatures both places and exaggerates
  the cultural gulf between them. (I make that claim as a
  Southerner who lived in NYC for four years.) It's one of many,
  many flaws in this ridiculous book. Read it if you like
  sensational stories with mass appeal (John Irving, etc.), but
  avoid it if you have any respect for the English language and for
  real American literature (Cheever, Plath, Hemingway, Cather,
  etc.). Don't be fooled by all the fools out there.</Text>

  <Text category="book">As a follower of the Celebration story for
  many years, I was greatly disappointed by what I thought would be
  a new and interesting perspective on the model town. It was
  nothing of the sort. The book had the feel of so many pages of
  anti-Disney propaganda, and the repetitiveness of a bad serial.
  The authors of Celebration U.S.A. clearly made up their minds
  about Celebration long before signing off on a mortgage. Lacking
  in the detail needed to illustrate Celebration's experiment with
  the tenets of neotraditional style, the book offered splashes of
  cliched generalities such as "a return to the past" and
  "recapturing tradition." It soon became some sort of mantra
  exhorting Disney's ownership of the town, the rules imposed on
  property improvements and maintenance, and, interestingly, the
  attention the town received. Most tactless of all was the shadow
  of mockery cast on every description of residents, conversation
  with neighbors, and interaction with people doing what the
  authors SHOULD have been doing: giving the town a chance</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">The best scene in the movie is the Italian
  restaurant scene with Janeane Garofalo, using a wry Randy Quaid
  as her foil when she's not ignoring him. It's the only scene that
  made me laugh. The scene with the playboy dad having three women
  in his home, and the one preceding it when his girlfriend's
  excessive dinner fails to impress the little kids, are both weak.
  Playboy dad is not interesting, and that character really
  shouldn't have been one of the three musketeers of this movie.
  The other dad, Reiser, is uncomfortable to watch. His dinner
  scene with his daughter is good in the sense that it shows how
  estranged a father can be with his teenage daughter, but that too
  is uncomfortable to watch. The later scene, up in the treehouse
  when his daughter suddenly loves him, is completely unbelievable.
  The fact is, that particular girl would not say those things to
  her dad. She doesn't love him. She doesn't need him at all. She's
  done with him. The stupid bit about Randy Quaid being a talk show
  star after busting into Rob Reiner's talk show is just dumb. That
  doesn't happen. If you want to write a cartoon, get Warner
  Brothers to draw it for you. Have the Road Runner in it, or Bugs
  Bunny. The film gives us comfort food at the end, with the trite
  and meaningless advice to love your kids. The fact is that your
  kids need love from their father when they are young, but once
  they hit a certain age, in double digits, you are done. Daddy
  just becomes the source of cash from then on. Kids in their teens
  and twenties don't want or need anything but money from dad.
  Fittingly, I saw this film on Father's Day. To sum the whole
  movie up, Janeane Garofalo is funny, Randy Quaid is kind of
  comfortable to watch although the script gets a little stupid at
  the tail end, and the other two male leads are just mildly
  annoying. The script doesn't say anything worthwhile about the
  subject it took on. But it takes a subject on, so at least that's
  something. It gives exposure and food for thought on the subject
  of how a father fits into his family</Text>

  The content is often broken up with cases and excercises that
  divide paragraphs in half. This makes it very confusing to follow

  painting a picture of a vast right-ring conspiracy that Hillary

  presidential candidate? Someone should have gone through this and
  culled out what was obsolete .. except that that would probably

  threadbare. Plus, there are no chapter breaks, which eventually
  pushes the pace until it feels like an assignment to continue.
  Next, the characters themselves begin to fall flat. There are
  only really two couples to keep track of, and yet it's difficult
  for the first third of the book to distinguish them. There is
  little to keep you interested in what they're doing or why they
  might be doing it. Smith's attempts at developing these four as
  characters come in fits and spurts. This seems obviously
  haphazard and hurried - the author is jamming in backstory
  whenever needed to explain characters' actions as if he were
  patching leaks in a dam. By the end of the book, the foursome
  seems to be as disinterested in each other as the reader is in
  them. And for the readers who are hoping to discover something of
  interest in the setting such as Mayan mythology or archeological
  lore, forget it. Aside from language barriers with the locals,
  there is no reason why this fantastical story couldn't have been
  set in the wilds of the Rocky Mountains, the Saharan desert, or
  anywhere else. The danger posed has nothing to do with Mexico,
  archeology or mythology at all. Ah yes, the danger posed. Well, I
  can't say much at all because anyone could give away the entire
  book with one line of explanation - that's how thin the plot is.
  The numerous other reviews that fault this as a short story
  masquerading as a novel are exactly right. Suffice it to say that
  when you do realize what the danger is (and you'll realize it
  well before any of the well-educated characters do), it's a real
  eye-roller, as if to say "I read this many pages for THIS?". By
  the time the story concludes, it's more irritating than
  suspenseful. The characters take so long to blithely undertake
  any course of action at all that you'll start rooting against
  them. Eventually scenes of gore start piling up in an obvious and
  lazy attempt to interject some action, but even aside from being
  misdirected, it's too little too late. This book could have been
  an adventure, a supernatural thriller, a survival tale, or a
  horror screenplay. It could have even taken the high road as an
  examination on people's reactions to situations of extreme
  stress: some take the lead, even enjoying the challenge, while
  others whither into a shell of hopelessness. But none of the
  possibilities ever come to fruition in this disappointing
  effort.</Text>
  <Text category="book">"Dark Tort" was inoffensive and certainly not
  painful to read, but for a novel that's supposed to be part of a
  quirky, light mystery series, I found things a bit leaden. The
  book took forever to get past the opening scene where the body
  was discovered, and when we finally do move beyond that scene, a
  huge tangle of clues and suspects quickly built up that slowed
  things down even further. I do admit that it also doesn't help
  that I'm one of those people who can't suspend disbelief and have
  to ask, "...so she's an off-site caterer yet she continually runs
  across dead bodies whose murderers need to be identified?" But,
  that's just me. Oh, well... many of the recipes did sound good,
  though I doubt I'll get around to making any of them. This is one
  of those reviews where it's probably best to just say that if you
  liked the previous entries in this series (which I personally
  haven't read but suspect aren't much different than this one),
  you'll likely enjoy this installment, too. The rest of us can
  just wait for the latest Robert B. Parker "Spenser" novel for our
  light mystery fix.</Text>
  <Text category="book">More Than Human is one of those books that has
  garnered high praise from the science fiction community because
  of its strong prose and original ideas. The writing is often
  compared to that of Faulkner but I wouldn't make that connection
  having read a few of Faulkner's works. Sturgeon uses many of
  Faulkner's narrative trademarks (i.e. streaming conscious, first
  person perspective of low IQ individuals, disorienting changes in
  first person narrative) but I didn't feel the net effect really
  compared to say something like As I Lay Dying. I love science
  fiction books and the readers in general love the genre which is
  why they want it to be taken seriously. This results in undue
  adulation and comparisons to mainstream books. More Than Human is
  slow, dated and not what I would describe as genre transcending
  nor would I recommend it to others. So the idea might of been
  original in the 50's but topics like telekenesis, ESP,
  computer-brain babies, and self produced morality and ethos have
  all been tackled more successfully in other science fiction
  classics before (Asimov) and since. This book rarely set off that
  wow! button in my head or kept me turning pages. This book simply
  did not have enough meat in it to make it anything more than
  mediocre at best. In 1953 there were 5 Hugo Award nominees for
  best science fiction book (Determined in a retro hugo award
  ballot in 2004) The Retro Hugo awards are fascinating because the
  voting (in this example) takes place 50 years later so the impact
  of the book on society can't really be ignored. Besides More Than
  Human, the far superior The Caves Of Steel, Childhood's End, and
  Farenheit 451 were among the other entries in a banner year for
  classic sci-fi. Needless to say, More Than Human did not win
  (Farenheit 451 did and rightfully so) Bottom Line: I wanted to
  like this book and it doesn't surprise me that others give it
  such high praise. These are probably people that don't read other
  genres enjoy congratulatory wankfests</Text>

  <Text category="music">I wrote a review but I guess it was so bad for
  Ultramagnetic, Amazon booted it. The album is trash. Nothing at
  all like the 3 studio albums made over a decade ago. But don't
  take my word for it, sample for yourself. Ahead of their time?
  Faith no more. What can I say about this album without my review
  getting kicked off Amazon again? I've used no profanity or
  content of explicit nature but this album highly does. 1988's
  CRITICAL BEATDOWN never, ever gave that kind of deliverance.
  That's why that's a classic and THE BEST KEPT SECRET is not, by
  any means (vocally, production, lyrically, concept). Can I get a
  witness? Please? DJ MOE LUV is the only producer on the album
  trying to keep that old Ultramagnetic sound alive here on
  "Vibrato" and "Mechanism Nice (Born Twice)" the album's 1st
  single. CED-GEE kills the album verbally and lyrically bragging
  of 16 bars in almsot every track and being very explicit and
  obscene (never heard that on CRITICAL BEATDOWN by CED). KOOL
  KEITH does fine on solo track "Late Nite Rumble" but KOOL KEITH
  is goin' nowhere with his lyricism and on most of the other
  songs, HIS delivery is sounding just like CED's towards the end
  of the album. T.R. LOVE? M.I.A. You see him in photos, you hear
  silence from him, he doesn't even produce a track. Production by
  CED, MOE and 2 others and the other 2 sound like KUTMASTA KURT
  producing (producer for most of KOOL KEITH solo stuff). I do not
  mean that in a good way. The beats of "Nottz" is bangin', the
  lyrics by both KEITH and CED should raise eyebrows on what's next
  to come for THE BEST KEPT SECRET being the B-side to the 1st
  single "Mechanism Nice (Born Twice)". Songs like "Ain't It Good 2
  U" (2007) and "Party Started" are for gentleman's clubs for the
  girls to dance to. Now do you see what direction this album is
  goin'? If you're lookin' for Ultramagnetic to comback with a
  reunion album with the same spacey super dope production and/or
  the masterful, brainiac, monkey wrench lyricism as CRITICAL
  BEATDOWN; FUNK YOUR HEAD UP and THE FOUR HORSEMEN albums gave you
  over a decade ago, you will not find it here. Maybe in the next
  14 years. Right Ultramag</Text>

  <Text category="book">I was eager to read this book only to find it
  a terrible dissapointment. One would think that a 'scholar' such
  as he would have at least a basic understanding of the Hebraic
  roots of Judeo-Christianity. It was obvious that he clearly was
  clueless to the known Messianic signs spoken of in the Gospels.
  He is also clueless to the Pharisidical Judaism of the time..not
  comprehending that all of Christ's teachings were completely in
  keeping with true Judaism. All of which can be found in
  contemporary Rabbinical teachings of His time. This book, which
  some unfortunate readers will swallow as truth will only continue
  to propagate a backward understanding of the gospels. Like it or
  not..the New Testament writings are Hebraic and explain what
  fulfilled Judaism is. Those who need to divorce Judaism from
  Christianity are offering a church which is already confused,
  just more confusion. It is through studying the Hebraic roots
  that we even begin to understand the 'difficult' sayings of our
  Lord; 'fullfillment of the Law', binding and loosing (the
  Law)..etc as well as the parables. The delivering of the deaf
  mute..was a Messianic sign, because the Rabbi's knew that 'they'
  had to ask the said demon its name but He did not. Lazerus's
  resurrection was a Messianic sign because the Rabbi's believed
  that anyone could come back to life during the first 'three' days
  after death. Cleansing of a leper was Messainic sign because the
  Rabbi's understood that it was a 'divine' punishment, that only
  God could lift. How else can we link Isa 53 with the 'stripes' He
  was to received as part of fulfilling the punishment the Law
  required for transgression, and yet 'minus one'. Had our Lord
  transgressed the Law, then the Jews themselves could have legally
  killed Him. Remember Paul (Saul)? He also does not understand
  John and his huge part in the whole picture, in that the Kingdom
  'began' with John. He was the 'breachmaker' as fortold in
  prophecy. This is Hebraic roots 101. People, please study the
  Hebraic roots of Christianity and do not waste your time with
  this book. The fact that he keeps defending his position as 'not'
  anti-semetic, should give you a clue</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Once again, the powers that be at Amazon have
  chosen to REFUSE to tell us if (in this case) the Darin/Dee

  or not. Pan-and-scan is garbage, and we won't buy it! (That's why
  I only gave 1 star for now. If they turn out to be widescreen,
  I'll give them both 5 stars.) "Format: Color" doesn't cut it.
  Color isn't a format, anyway - it's a specification or type.
  Widescreen is a format (as is DVD and VHS, to begin with). So why
  the deep dark secret about certain movies, Amazon? You list many

  of anyone with whom he comes into contact. "The Mysteries of
  Pittsburgh" was a well-received, yet while at times I found it
  entertaining and witty, in truth it's a very bumpy piece of work
  in which the characters don't really convince. The plot is
  unconvincing from the first, and descends into absurdity towards
  the end. In summary, it reads very much as a first effort,
  perhaps an experiment, but I found it baffling that anyone could

  <Text category="book">Heinlein loads this book up with hooks in the
  early pages to catch your attention. Unfortunately, these hooks
  turn out to be superfluous and lead nowhere. This shoddy
  technique is found in all four of Hienlein's final books. We are
  also treated to some of Heinlein's stock characters, dirty old
  men, horny female computers, naked adolescent girls, and dominant
  beauties who would be right at home in leather and whips. Without
  these archetype characters most Heinlein novels written after
  1970 would have a sparse population indeed. As if this isn't
  enough, Heinlein drags in his usual cast of characters from his
  other novels as he is so prone to doing. In spite of all their
  cameo appearances, this group remains dull and one dimensional
  throughout. Heinlein's earlier novels written prior to 1960 are
  still fine fare for young people, especially boys. This novel, as
  well as most of Heinlein's later work will be enjoyed primarily
  by a group of die hard fans and is definitely not for general

  <Text category="dvd">Season 1 of Veronica Mars took me by surprise,
  and I really enjoyed the ride. The second season, however,
  doesn't live up to the quality of the first. Instead of one large
  mystery, in season two viewers are treated to several smaller
  mysteries to solve. There's nothing wrong with that approach, but
  it seemed that as fast as one mystery skien got solved, another
  would pop right up without any resolution for the first. Many
  episodes ended with my friends and I turning to one another and
  asking, "Is that it? Where's the rest of it?" This happened quite
  a bunch, with the child abuse investigation episode as perhaps
  the most jarring. Are we really supposed to believe someone as
  determined as Veronica would just pick up and call it quits
  because she gets a weird slap on the wrist? That's totally out of
  character, yet we never see that family, the abused girl, or hear
  about the incident again. That type of confusion and weird plot
  points kept popping up. The "major" villain of the season comes
  out of left field to be the murderer, and his motivation for
  murder ends up being really weak and unbelievable. Because of the
  all the loose ends, go-nowhere plots, and the surprise villain
  who was probably a surprise to the writers up until deadline, I'm
  giving Season 2 a 2 star rating. Season 2 of Veronica Mars still
  has some funny dialogue, and some clever episodes, but it doesn't
  deserve all the 4 and 5 star reviews I've seen. I'll continue to
  watch, however, as Veronica Mars has a lot of promise. Hopefully
  the producers can get things in gear for season 3</Text>

  glasses. I own several pairs and think they are great. However,
  the Sport Goggles DO NOT get my vote of confidence. They have
  three problems which make them unusable for me: 1) on all CliC
  products there is an all important stem adjustment that adjusts
  the length of the stems to properly fit the glasses onto your
  head. However, unlike the very cool regular reading glasses by
  CliC, the Sport Googles do not adjust properly and so the Goggles
  run very tight if you need even a slightly above average stem
  legnth, 2) there is also extra foam padding on the Sport Googles
  that make them very snug, but because of the tight stems the foam
  padding makes these glasses far too tight to enjoy and 3)the
  maker doesn't make it as clear as they should in their
  description ... the Irridium (Red)colored lens on some of the
  Sports Goggles are far too intensely tinted and dark for any kind
  of regular light conditions or applications like morning driving
  ... or even safe walking on a rocky path. Sorry Clic, but your

  birthday from her Grandpa and while it's a great concept and I
  think she would really like it, it doesn't really work. Erasing

  I know it will bother her to be unable to erase old drawings and

  <Text category="dvd">This film is a perfect example of how straight
  action and big-name stars cannot replace the necessity of well
  written drama. I will not give away the plot -- although that is
  admittedly hard to do since there is so little of it. Basically
  Clooney's character Mr. Ocean, a career burgler, is released from
  prison with a plan to rob the vault of a Las Vegas casino. So he
  recruits 11 men, each with a talent to add to the operation. This
  is where the trouble begins. The viewer is given no reason at all
  why he should sympathize with any of these characters. There is
  almost no introduction to many of them, and barely even a mention
  of their names. Literally half an hour into the film "the eleven"
  are assembled and they're already robbing the casino. How's that
  for plot development? And that's basically it ladies and
  gentlemen: go to Vegas, rob casino, go home, movie over. Some of
  the "good guys" are even outright repellant. Our would-be heros'
  enterprise is bankrolled by some greasy Hollywood tycoon. Am I
  supposed to like this fat weasel? The only reason we are given to
  sympathize at all with at least Mr. Ocean, is that the guy he's
  robbing, the casion owner, is a really bad guy. Supposedly he has
  people killed 'n stuff. (This actor played a bad guy in Godfather
  Part 3). But we never see any real evil deeds. In fact, he just
  seems like a handsome, polite, very prosperous businessman. He
  manages to raise his voice for just one line in the entire film.
  Mr. Ocean on the other hand, and his cohorts, are career
  criminals. But the guy they're robbing is an even greater
  criminal, you see. So that makes it OK. And really, if you were
  being robbed, wouldn't you want to be robbed by George Clooney
  and Brad Pitt? They're such nice guys. That makes getting robbed
  fun. Just a couple of nice guys stealing from another nice guy.
  How thrilling. This entire film is a rushed series of action
  sequences punctuated by a few soap opera moments with Julia
  Roberts. There are a few minor things going on in the backgroung,
  like a boxing match, which are essentially irrelevent. Throughout
  there seems to be vital information missing (like say, a plot).
  Soderbergh simply did a terrible job of making me care what
  happens to Clooney and Roberts. This film is also horribly cut.
  Several times what seemed like vital plot details were intoduced,
  and then completely forgotten about. Take the scene where Pitt
  and a buddy are casing out the joint and the casino's owner makes
  an appearence. The folder he has just been handed, explains Pitt,
  contains secret security codes. You would think that would be
  something important right? You would think they will need to get
  those codes. Well, wrong. In fact you won't hear or see a single
  thing more about them for the rest of the movie. They introduce
  what seems to be an important detail and then totally abandon it
  without any development. And that happens all the time in this
  movie. In fact Mr. Ocean's team gets down the secure elevator
  shaft and into the vault with only minor difficulties. (And boy,
  they started repelling down that shaft quick, didn't they? You
  didn't even know they were robbing the place yet. Wow, these guys
  are good. Or maybe Steven Soderbergh is as over-rated as his
  film.) They make it look easier than breaking into the safe at
  7-eleven. This, after Mr. Ocean briefed his crew at the beginning
  on the nearly impregnable security measures the vault was
  supposed to have. One would hope this film would at least end
  strong. But Soderburgh makes the final scene open ended in such a
  way as to leave the audience confused and disappointed. We are
  left wondering whether the "eleven" actually got away with their
  caper...or worse. What a way to completely overturn the mood of a
  movie that at least had the merit of being light-hearted. The
  writer of the screenplay even said as much in the audio
  commentary to the DVD! (As did the actors in their
  commentary.)Probably the best moment on this DVD is hearing the
  screenwriter tell Soderbergh to his face that he screwed up the
  ending. I am loath to give either 1 or 5 stars, since hardly
  anything is absolutely good or bad, but this film comes very
  close to 1 star. This is your standard artistically worthless
  Hollywood product. It is big on budget, big on bling, and low on
  story. I suppose if you just feel like wasting some time, this is
  as good a way to do it as any. Personally I would rather have a
  story with more substance</Text>

  <Text category="music">on the liner notes to one of the two blues
  albums (i think it is shaker) it is said that the original idea
  was just to perform some of these songs in a one night concert.
  that should have been as far as it went. to foist these songs on
  an unsuspecting public at 19 bucks a crack is highway robbery. if
  these are blues songs, then i am robert johnson's illegitimate
  son. "death letter" is good, maybe even great, but cannot compare
  to the original or to any of the covers i have previously heard.
  the rest is a waste of time. the cover art is excellent but
  hardly the reason you would be expected to buy the cd. these are
  my first 2 reviews by the way, but all these 5-star reviews for
  both cd's finally got me motivated. go buy a muddy waters or
  lightning hopkins cd and save 10 bucks in the bargain</Text>

  lack of respect for women as human beings.What makes me the most
  furious is his shadowy writing which can lead a young woman to

  allow the boys and men to take the lead in life.The resounding
  message is girls and women are potentially inferior and cannot
  because of our hormones make important contributions to society
  beyond traditional roles.I don't remember ever being taken over
  by hormones and rendered down to a emotional bundle of primative

  called WB 50th Anniversary, it should be called "Scene It -

  <Text category="dvd">The original "Candyman" sucks so bad, but
  everybody praises it and I kept wondering to myself, "am I
  missing something?" So, I tried watching it again and it still
  sucked as I could not even get through it, so I figured maybe I
  should watch the sequels and maybe I would find something that I
  liked about this series. Well, after watching "Candyman 2", one
  becomes cognizant that this series is just full of
  rubbish...again, the social overtones and politically correct
  notions present in this series make the movie absurd in the
  extreme. The villain in "Candyman" makes me want to laugh because
  he is so NOT scary...if you want a good laugh, watch the
  "Candyman" series, but if you want to be scared, you would even
  do better to watch "Ren and Stimpy". In all seriousness, watch
  "Halloween" and "Halloween II" if you want to see a good slasher
  and horror movie that really produces the goods and doesn't try
  to send a social message. LOL. Some people call "Candyman 2-
  Farewell to the Flesh" a horror movie...I just call it
  rubbish</Text>

  enthused. Until I went through 5 diapers, everyone of which
  leaked. Leaking of urine was the biggest problem but after a BM
  came out the legs, I gave up. I tried everything possible to make
  these work, but they leak. Maybe in the smaller sizes, but size 5
  on a 22 month old definitely did NOT work. Also, my son is in 50%

  <Text category="health">My Braun thermoscan has given me nothing but
  trouble. Yes this ear thermometer is easy to use. You just have
  to stick it into the canal correctly. Not hard. What I don't like
  is you can stick it in the same ear, the same way, 6 different
  times and get very different readings. Everytime I have gone to
  use my thermometer, the battery would be dead. You have to use
  the special medical circular batteries, so of course I would
  never have any handy. Then I got smart and started stocking up on
  the batteries. They are expensive. And everytime I would use it
  I'd have to put in a fresh new battery. This also needs the
  disposable ear covers in order for it to work. Yes there is a
  trick to getting around it but then your thermometer isn't
  sanitary. Finding the covers was sometimes easy and sometimes
  impossible. I have just never been happy with it. Yes it's easier
  than the oral... But I found one even better. Try the Temporal
  Artery Thermometer. You can use that one on a sleeping

  pressure what-so-ever, and didn't keep the device in one area for
  too long. The result..... worse than any sunburn I've ever had!
  My legs are burned in various areas, as the product sanded off
  the first layer of my skin! The skin hardened and has begun to
  crack in the burned areas. I'm a little concerned and think I

  <Text category="book">I am a big fan of the Missing Manual series.
  Previous books have given me lots of insights into my installed
  software and have made my computing time much more efficient. I
  therefore approached this book with much enthusiasm. Office is
  such a gargantuan program, with tons of bells and whistles, that
  Microsoft itself estimates that most users take advantage of less
  than a third of its capabilities. However, the book is a major
  disappointment, because of its many mistakes and poor
  organization. Most of the mistakes are ones you can work
  around--for example, on page 8 the topics covered by appendixes A
  and B are reversed--but the sheer number of such mistakes makes
  reading the book a major distraction. Every few pages I find
  myself going to the Missing Manuals web site to report yet more
  errata, such as incomplete or wrong instructions, figures that do
  not agree with the text or figure captions, incomprehensible
  writing, seeming confusion between the Mac and PC versions of the
  program, etc. And I agree wholeheartedly with a previous reviewer
  who complained about the inadequate index. It looks as though
  O'Reilly Publishers did not do an adequate proofing of the book,
  but instead rushed it out as soon as possible. That is too bad,
  because I will now be much more hesitant to purchase another
  Missing Manuals title</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">As in my title I have mixed feelings about
  this toy. My children both have the original color version of the
  VideNow. I thought I would upgrade them to the newer version.
  They have a cheap feel to them and don't seem to work very well.
  In fact one is going back to the store next week for a trade in.
  There is a lock botton that freezes the bottons so you can't
  accidently turn off while watching. But it seems like the buttons
  freeze up on their own quite often. I can see why the batteries
  go dead quickly because if a child can't turn off the unit it
  just gets left on! I am very dissapointed in this. The kids
  really enjoyed their Color versions and I feel I shouldn't have
  gone to the extra expense to upgrade them. However, even with
  it's faults my kids still enjoy them. My kids don't watch a lot
  of TV and prefer the shorter pvds to the long Dvds. I prefer that
  too. That way I can say they can watch one show and know they
  won't be watching for an hour or more. If you are a parent
  thinking about purchassing one- keep you receipt in case you need
  to exchange and carefully think about how your kids will be using
  it. If your child is easily dissapointed by items that may not
  work properly this may not be the item for you</Text>
  <Text category="book">Gerd Ludemann writes, "historical research
  shows with definite clarity that Jesus was not raised from the
  dead...we must acknowledge...a worldwide historical hoax", (190).
  A summary review of his treatment will be sufficient to
  demonstrate that his conclusion is preposterously more forceful
  than even his strongest individual argument can support. Three
  streams of thought permeate "The Resurrection of Christ": gospel
  writers each reworked tradition so as to embellish, invent, or
  explain away; Peter and Paul experienced hallucination and
  "vision" experiences proceeding from self-deception; belief in
  the supernatural is for the ignorant and unscientific. Each of
  these bespeaks either erroneous assumptions, or avoidance of two
  hundred years of scholarly response against counter-Christian
  polemic. In his chapter "Translation and analysis of the Early
  Christian texts on the Resurrection", Ludemann applies a pattern
  of subtexts which he titles "purpose and tradition reworked" (re.
  Gospel writers), and "historical elements". In the former he
  charges the gospel writers with adding to early tradition simply
  to reinforce their individual apologetic, or perhaps (he
  intimates) to cover up some element of embarrassment. For
  example, Ludemann asserts that we may conclude that Joseph of
  Arimathea was a member of the Jewish Council (which condemned
  Jesus), but that Mark (earliest gospel) "likely" invented notions
  that the same was waiting for the kingdom of God and had become a
  disciple of Jesus. But Ludemann needs to discredit such notions,
  for all four gospel writers record Joseph as the rich council
  member that buried Jesus in his own tomb. Ludemann's case will be
  much weaker if Jesus is actually buried in a tomb that could be
  checked later to refute resurrection claims or appearances.
  Ludemann gets carried away with himself when he, in tabloid
  fashion, suggests that perhaps the gospel writer is trying to
  "disinfect a tradition...of a dishonorable burial" of Jesus. This
  is entirely ad hoc and enjoys absolutely no support from the
  texts he purports to analyze. Ludemann goes so far as to accuse
  Matthew, Mark and Luke of being anti-Jewish! (Refer to the
  ridiculous Appendix 3). Is Christianity a "history of self
  deception"? Ludemann invests in the rather high-risk prospect of
  hallucination; for the burden is on Ludemann to successfully
  argue against several strains of evidence for the physical
  appearances of Jesus available in the New Testament. That any
  explanation can be posited does not equal all explanations are
  equally valid. Ludemann simply fails to evince that we ought to
  prefer hallucination as that which is best attested to by the
  various strata of available evidence. 1 Corinthians 15 is the New
  Testament text historians consistently refer to as central to the
  discussion of Jesus' multiple appearances. Even critical scholars
  date the creedal portion of the text (vs. 3-5) to the early 30's
  AD. The discussion advances from death to burial to resurrection,
  three physical events. Also, the post resurrection gospel
  narratives speak of Jesus eating and offering his body for
  examination, as well as being hugged! Ludemann though, convinced
  that he has dispensed with those gospel narratives after the
  fashion mentioned above, and prejudiced by his atheistic
  presuppositions, introduces hallucination. What accounts for
  these hallucinations? "Peter's vision is an example of
  unsuccessful mourning" (165). Paul's "event had a character of
  light and, like the vision of John, happened in the spirit, i.e.,
  in ecstasy" (47). But Paul does not report "I was in the Spirit"
  as John does (see Revelation 1). John is deliberately conveying a
  non-physical experience. Paul is not. When Paul does have
  opportunity to convey an actual "in the spirit" experience, he
  does so in terms appropriate to that experience (2 Corinthians
  12:2). So we have record of Paul's ability to intentionally
  differentiate between the physical and the purely spiritual.
  Ludemann employs his fanciful tendencies beyond credulity when he
  engages "modern depth psychology" to explain Paul's conversion
  from zealous persecutor of Christians to "Apostle-in-Chief of a
  new program of salvation" (170-171). So, we may more accurately
  adduce historical veracity from a study of Paul's subconscious
  state, than from the widely accepted facts of Jesus death,
  burial, empty tomb and appearances! Ludemann's examination of
  history fails for he maintains a priori rejection of the
  supernatural. Historians look for the best explanation of the
  evidence. Yet Ludemann writes, "Who decides at what point of
  historical study a `theological explanation' ought to begin"
  (201). This is rife with misunderstanding. One need only confirm
  that an event occurred in history, regardless of theological
  implications. Also, simple and sophisticated philosophic
  arguments conclude that theism (thus supernaturalism) is an
  entirely logical proposition. Yet Ludemann quotes another author,
  "[the disciples] believed in phantoms; ... imagined that they
  were surrounded by miracles; ... took no part whatsoever in the
  positive science of the time." (175). This ignores the New
  Testament textual evidence that initially Jesus' disciples did
  not believe the resurrection had happened, and in other places
  they marveled at his many miraculous works. Even their primitive
  sense of science informed their lack of expectation for such a
  miracle! Ludemann is exactly right when he agrees with Paul that
  if there is no resurrection, we should abandon Christianity.
  Sadly, he reaches the wrong conclusion. Self deluded by a
  proliferation of "one can imagine", "seems to indicate", "likely
  enough", and "one thus suspects" reasoning, Ludemann boasts
  "accepting my perishability gives rise to a truer Easter vision".

  <Text category="music">I purchased this album because I am a fan of
  the Last Poets. Upon listening to the samples provided by

  very similar content to the Last Poets: some great politically
  charged poetry, perhaps accompanied by some funky beats. However,
  when I listened to the whole CD, I was disappointed to find out
  that the vast majority of the tracks sound the most like "Get Out
  of the Ghetto Blues." If more of the tracks had the sound of the
  title track, this would be a five-star album, in my opinion.
  True, Scott-Heron has a lot of great social commentary throughout

  <Text category="dvd">I'll give the leads the benefit of the doubt
  that they're actually a lot better than this lame-o-flick
  deserves. Kutcher and Murphy are Tom and Sara, the mismatched
  couple that loves itself to pieces in this story which strains
  for laughs. After a whirlwind romance, Sara introduces Tom to her
  tony Beverly Hills family. They marry and the rest (much like
  their marriage) is quickly history. Things go bad from the
  wedding night (bloody noses, no sex) and only get worse. After
  Tom nearly burns down the French Chalet that Sara booked them
  into (after a fatal misunderstanding involving voltage
  differences in Europe and an electric sex-toy), and compounds
  problems by taking them to the worst hotel in Venice
  (cockroaches, dust and no sex), our heroes quickly realize that
  they are on the Honeymoon-from-hell. At first they gamely make a
  go of it, not realizing that they're only saving their tension
  for the perfect moment. "Just Married" was a simple idea for a
  flick. People have been laughing at marriage for years. Maybe
  that's why the jokes seem forced - the sex-toy fiasco painfully
  illustrates how far the script will go to get a laugh, and we get
  that one early on. Every joke is actually half of a joke about
  Sara and Tom can't have sex, climaxing (really, no pun intended -
  I mean it!) when Sara tricks custom's inspectors into giving her
  hated hubby a full-rectal exam (cut to the scene of Tom walking
  bow-legged onto the plane; obviously he's the victim, but in the
  perverse logic of this unsexual non-comedy, you've got to wonder
  whether Tom is actually the victor - he at least got some.) The
  script can't get past a monumental plot gap: Tom and Sara really
  don't have anything in common - you'd think they'd have learnt
  and gotten past their foibles while they dated, but the story
  skips past much of that. Tom's the hero, but he's an idiot - the
  script makes him out as the ugly American, an utterly dated
  cliche (he's surprised that nobody in Europe watches American
  baseball; he's the kind of idiot who uses "American" instead of
  "English" when referring to language - as in "Why isn't there a
  sign in American warning against using US voltage sex-toys in
  France?" The laughs are far and few in between - the best ones
  involve cars (both the ridiculous sub-compact they rent in
  France, and the Dodge Barracuda (at least I think it's a `Cuda)
  that Tom drives - a monster which was probably meant to remind us
  about "That 70's show" but which looks like a prop from the
  "Phantasm" movies. If ever there was a flick that needed help

  <Text category="book">I'm really disappointed in this book, because
  the author seems to imply that you can have ANYTHING you want,
  but that is just not the case. It's a deceptive title. I can
  honestly say that this book is worthless and is not going to help
  you; you're better off practising Feng Shui and hanging little
  crystals in your house than reading this book (and I'm not
  knocking Feng Shui, I practise it myself). People like the author
  of this book just want to make a quick buck at your expense. In
  the end, you'll just feel worse off, looking for the "next big
  thing" to promise you some more snake oil. Another fact I'd like
  to point out is that this author sells this book in CD format for
  around $60.00 (I got a flyer in the mail). If he is truly living
  life according to his principles why would he even charge for
  these so-called "secrets," doesn't that go against his own moral
  values? One of the gimmicks of the CDs is that you can learn the
  secret sound of "creation," as if chanting "Ahhhh" is going to
  make everything alright. Thanks to Dyer and others like him, I am

  <Text category="book">"...minus several million for good
  thinking..." - Zaphod Beeblebrox, THE HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE
  GALAXY The above quote (and the score I've assigned to this book)
  aren't in reference to the text or the author, but to the
  publishers. Why anyone with the brains of a sea urchin would
  cross Professor Hawking as they seem to have done is beyond me.
  Briefly, save your money and buy THE ILLUSTRATED BRIEF HISTORY OF
  TIME instead of THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING, even if you're a
  compulsive Hawking completist. Alert readers should notice that
  Hawking doesn't hold the copyright for THEORY OF EVERYTHING, and
  attempted to block its publication. It was originally titled THE
  CAMBRIDGE LECTURES: LIFE WORKS, and appears to have been drawn
  from some recordings of lectures given by the professor years
  ago. (See the professor's web site for details.) The "vanilla"
  (i.e., not the ILLUSTRATED) THEORY OF EVERYTHING consists of an
  introduction, seven lectures, and an index, without *any*
  illustrations or diagrams. Out of curiosity, I compared a library
  copy of it with THE ILLUSTRATED BRIEF HISTORY OF TIME. Unless
  otherwise noted, each of the 7 lectures corresponds to a chapter
  of the same name in BRIEF HISTORY, in some segments only with
  slightly different paragraphing and punctuation (and occasionally
  the kind of spelling errors that creep in when one transcribes
  audio narration to text, if I may speculate as to the cause). I
  don't understand why anyone would prefer the less polished text
  of THEORY OF EVERYTHING to THE ILLUSTRATED BRIEF HISTORY OF TIME,
  which not only has updates for new areas of research, but has
  been revised and rearranged to explain things more gently to the
  layperson. "Ideas About the Universe" is essentially an extract
  from "Our Picture of the Universe", the first chapter of BRIEF
  HISTORY, with about one sentence's worth of drift per paragraph.
  BRIEF HISTORY's version of "The Expanding Universe" has a more
  gradual introduction to the methods of measuring distances to
  nearby stars, and explains technical terms that may be unfamiliar
  to the non-scientist, such as luminosity. THEORY OF EVERYTHING
  really shows its age in "Black Holes" when compared to BRIEF
  HISTORY, as Hawking has not been idle in that area over the
  years. The illustrated edition of BRIEF HISTORY has had a fair
  bit of interesting material added to "Black Holes", especially
  regarding cosmic censorship and naked singularities (Hawking
  having made a few *more* bets on the subject with Preskill and
  Thorne, although he paid off the Cygnus X-1 wager). "Black Holes
  Ain't So Black" lacks major blocks of clarification/explanation
  added by Hawking to the version in BRIEF HISTORY. BRIEF HISTORY's
  version of "The Origin and Fate of the Universe" goes into more
  detail: about the kinds of particles that are predicted to have
  come out of the big bang, and what sort of results we'd expect to
  see today if the predictions hold, and the scientists who first
  put forward these theories. BRIEF HISTORY also contains a much
  longer version of the "open questions" section, leading more
  gradually up to the discussion of Guth's development of the
  inflationary model. "The Direction of Time" corresponds to BRIEF
  HISTORY's "The Arrow of Time" (which is worth picking up just for
  the picture of the keeper of the U.S. cesium clock). BRIEF
  HISTORY goes into more detailed examples to explain what Hawking
  means by the psychological arrow of time, with the simplest kind
  of "computer": an abacus. "The Theory of Everything" mainly
  corresponds to BRIEF HISTORY's more modestly titled "The
  Unification of Physics", which is much more up to date (string
  theories are still covered, but a lot more work has been done in
  that area over the years). The tail end of the lecture
  corresponds to the ending of BRIEF HISTORY's "Conclusion". -- In
  summary, this is interesting stuff, but THE ILLUSTRATED BRIEF
  HISTORY OF TIME does it better</Text>

  <Text category="book">The Scientific Method applied to this book: 1)
  Form a hypothesis: Great managers do something differently than
  mediocre managers. 2) Conduct an experiment: Interview 80,000
  managers. 3) Analyze data: ???this step is missing??? 4) Draw
  conclusions: Write this Book. With the exception of the "12
  questions", the authors make no attempt to back any their
  conclusions with the results of their study. They make several
  insightful statements, such as "many managers say they would like
  to define the right outcomes." However, they do not even attempt
  to tell the reader how the study led them to this statement. Did
  90% of the managers interviewed state this? Did 60% of the great
  managers state this while only 10% of the mediocre managers did?
  Does "many managers" mean 100 managers? 100 managers seems like
  "many managers" at first, but considering 80,000 were interviewed
  I 100 managers is a negligible amount. The entire book consists
  of several rational statements that are not supported by their
  study. It seems to me that after conducting a huge study to find
  out what great managers do differently, the authors found almost
  no common trends. However, since they put a lot of money and
  effort into conducting the study, they needed something to show
  for it and wrote this book. If Buckingham and Coffman didn't
  claim this book was a result of "the largest study of its kind,"
  I would say it offers some decent advice; however, since it does
  make this claim, I wish they would have back up their conclusions
  so the readers would be able to determine how valid they
  are.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This out of all the many versions of Jane Eyre
  has to be my least favorite... Granted Samantha Morton has a very
  adorable fairy/ Elfin like face like Mr Rochesters Description of
  her, but her acting has no highs and lows. She stands up to Mr
  Edwards a little too much giving really snappy answers, seemingly
  no respect to her employer, which is not fault of hers, the
  writing of the script is bad.... and so the direction. Ciaran
  Hinds is totally over the top. He is so angry with no
  understanding, his eyes are very lustful and at times crazed. He
  is not at all like the character described in Brontes epic book
  of a very sad and tortured man who falls hopelessly in love with
  the innocence and singular personality of earnest, honest and yet
  strong sweet Jane Eyre that Charlotte Bronte brought so vividly
  to life with her classic words. The over acting of both during
  the proposal scene is almost comical.To me there is no love,
  feeling or chemistry here between the two actors just lust.... He
  seems to be going through a middle age crises just eyeing up this
  young girl, and she though supposedy a virgin... she dosn't act
  like one. Plus this movie seems very rushed you can never get a
  good foot hold of the story Especially during Janes childhood. I
  do also miss the Gypsy scene that is omitted in many of these
  movies and was expertly done in the Dalton /Clarke mini series,
  which brought some brief light heartednes to an otherwise very
  dark story. If you want to see great versions. I highly rate the
  1944 movie with Orson Wells though it is another abreviatd
  version, that movie truly captured the spirit and feel. It is
  moody dark and mysterious. Another is the fantastic Timothy
  Dalton version which is most accurate to the book of all the
  movies taking actual lines right from the Brontes story. Dalton's
  and Clarkes acting is simply superbly sublime! However if you are
  like me, see them all and make your own decision. They all have
  something to offer and most are entertaining...</Text>
  <Text category="book">I picked this book up a couple days ago with a
  few others, hoping to learn about America's prison system. I
  think our prison system is horrible and I was hoping that this
  book would give me some more information on the topic.
  Unfortunately, in the first twenty pages of the book, Elsner
  claims that America imprisons 704 people per every 10,000
  citizens. If you do the math, that equals 7% of our population.
  7% of our population is greater than the population of the State
  of New York. According to this author, there are more people in
  prison in this country than live in the State of New York. Before
  you get too worried, let me reassure you that this is not the
  case. America imprisons 736 people per *100,000* citizens (as of
  5/06), or .736% of the population. This is the highest rate in
  the entire world, so there's no need to move the decimal point to
  make it seem more dramatic. For comparison, Stalin had .771% of
  his citizens imprisoned in the Gulags during the height of the
  Purges. Again, there's really no need to exaggerate America's
  rate of incarceration. What disappoints me is that this error is
  not simply a typo on one page, but is repeated several times.
  Apparently the author actually believes we imprison 7% of our
  population, and the editors at Prentice Hall think that makes
  sense as well, as do all the luminaries who glowingly endorsed
  this book on the back cover. Personally, I can't take anything
  this author says seriously if there are errors so blatant a
  novice in the subject can them pick out, on the first twenty
  pages no less. If a subject as basic as prison population is
  exaggerated by a power of 10, how do we know the rest of the book
  isn't off by a power of 10? Elsner makes prison reform advocates
  look like the bunch of uninformed dreamers conservatives like to
  imagine. Don't buy this book</Text>

  insincere. The book itself is almost entirely filler on how to
  read music (which half the music books in Borders are or they are
  just giant scale books that are reemed out like saw dust totally
  useless, which leads to the great difficulty on how to actually
  find an explantion to this jargon and then someone comes along
  and says they have an answer that will make things clear but then
  they fall short) up until half the the book and many times
  periodically things are just repeated terminology loosely defined
  such as hook which is just recording industry jargon not theory.
  Book never goes into the physical principals that would actually
  explain some things in it as to why the notes themselves are in
  the order they are such as acoustics, never got an answer as to
  what a whole step or a half step was by the way and when I asked
  many teachers and questioned them they knew nothing or gave a
  circular answer defining it themselves without an outside
  reference only to find that they were just parroting it all
  along. The problems with this is everything is assumed in the
  entire field. I recommend the only book that I have found that
  made some sense to me called Fractals in Music by Charles Madden
  much more organized and assembles things from the very beginning
  working into more and more complex shapes and structures.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">THE TRANSFORMERS gets my vote as the worst
  movie of the 1980's. It pains me to say this for I am a fan of
  the series. It was a travesty to see Optimus Prime (the greatest
  of the Transformers) fall in battle and pass on the Matrix of
  Leadership to a successor (Rodimus Prime) who proved incapable of
  leadership. Galvatron was a pathetic reincarnation of
  Megatron--he lacked the malevolent cunning of Megatron and
  behaved like a raving lunatic. Why would a Decepticon warrior
  follow him into battle? As for the new generations of Autobots
  and Decepticons introduced in the movie, they were forgettable.
  It amuses me that "fans" are raving about the movie now yet they
  did not pay to see the movie when it was released twenty years
  ago. THE TRANSFORMERS failed at the box office and I am glad it
  did. As a fan, I was insulted. Perhaps these other "fans" have
  allowed nostalgia to blind them to the ugly truth of this
  outrage.</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">So this was the breakout movie for Mira
  Sorvino, the one that earned her an Academy Award for Best
  Supporting Actress in 1995. This movie, and Mira Sorvino's
  performance in it, was so bad that after it was over, I just had
  to find out who her competitors were for the 1995 Best Supporting
  Actress category. Let's see.....according to Wikipedia they were:
  Kathleen Quinlin ("Apollo 13" - a fairly standard
  worried-wife-of-astronaut-in-danger role), Mare Winningham
  ("Georgia" - did not see this one), Joan Allen ("Nixon" - did not
  see, but how hard can it be to play the wooden Pat Nixon?), and
  Kate Winslet ("Sense and Sensibilities" - did not see either, but
  Ang Lee was robbed by the Academy here also). It only proves just
  how few good roles there are for women in today's Hollywood that
  Mira Sorvino could win an Oscar for this sort of performance. And
  I was beginning to warm up to her, too - she was great in "Romy
  and Michele's High School Reunion", and terrific also in
  "Beautiful Girls". So, what exactly is so bad about this movie?
  Here's a brief list: 1. Mira Sorvino plays the entire movie in a
  high-pitched falsetto that sounds like her voice is breaking.
  Another reviewer described this as similar to listening to
  fingernails on a blackboard. Maybe in 1995, because she was new,
  the Academy didn't realize that this wasn't her real voice and
  took pity on her.... 2. Stupid plot device of the Greek Chorus.
  3. Stupid happy ending with a twist. 4. Lots of profanity and
  dialogue that includes explicit descriptions of sex acts done in
  pornography movies.....while this movie is not itself a porn
  flick, the explicit details of the porn industry included in the
  dialogue definitely makes it NOT a movie for families to watch.
  5. Odd sight of a very old and wrinkly Woody Allen (with dyed
  hair and bald spot) making out with TWO women young enough to be
  his granddaughters.....all right, so I'm just jealous - Woody
  still looks gross.... 6. Cliched, poorly developed characters, a
  plotline that goes around in circles, and lots and lots of
  pointless, unfunny dialogue. In summary, this movie is bad, bad,
  bad......</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">If the girls in this film were considered
  "hot" back in 1979 then I'm glad I was still in preschool. Some
  unattractive women, not college age girls, but actual 30-year-old
  women who cannot get into the popular Pi sorority start their own
  sorority called H.O.T.S. which stands for Help Out The Seals and
  sadly their pet seal was the best part of the movie. The goal of
  the H.O.T.S. girls is to steal all the guys away from Pi house,
  so they throw "wild" parties, jump topless out of a airplane (too
  bad the camera was on the ground), fly a hot air balloon over the
  Pi house to launch pies on the Pi girls as they sunbathe topless,
  etc. The script seems to have been written by a 12-year-old,
  which isn't a bad thing. I liked the fast-paced wackiness of it
  all and the frequent topless scenes were nice. Unfortunately I
  didn't find any of the girls even remotely attractive. If this
  film was remade today with the same amount of nudity and with
  Nikki Ziering, Brittany Daniel, Shannon Elizabeth and Jenna
  Jameson as the four main H.O.T.S. girls and maybe Catherine Bell
  as the house mom it would gross over $800 million in DVD sales. I
  also agree with one of the previous reviewers who complained

  approach and analysis of Dr. King apart from the obligatory
  images we're force-fed each new year. Instead, I was disappointed
  to find that Eric Dyson made heavy use of speculation with the
  intent to scandalize more than to inform and enlighten. One such
  example includes Dyson conveying the idea that Dr. King may have
  engaged in orgies with many different women along with his
  right-hand man Ralph Abernathy. He then goes on to infer that
  there was talk of King and Abernathy engaging in sexual acts with
  each other! The author had no commentary to either support or
  dispel this "theory" making Dyson's retelling of the alleged
  incident totally irresponsible and even libelous. He just dropped
  the information, true or untrue, in the readers lap to do with as
  the reader pleased. To that end, it is my opinion that Dyson's
  intent in writing this book was in no way honorable or
  truth-seeking, rather it was a means to convey his baseless ideas
  to anyone who would listen. I'm reminded of something my
  grandmother and mother would always say to me, "an empty wagon

  <Text category="toys_games">I am a parent of a 9 year old daughter who
  loves dolls. She was given the Love me CHOU CHOU doll for
  Christmas (12/25/05). On Christmas day we were unable to get the
  doll to fall asleep, so on 12/26/05 I went back to the store to
  exchange the doll. With no luck I found that the second doll
  would not fall asleep either. I looked on the zapf-creation
  web-site under most frequently asked questions and received more
  instructions on how to get the doll to fall asleep and still the
  doll will not fall asleep. Apparently this is a problem, not only
  with the doll my daughter has but with other customers as well.
  If the company knows that this is one of the most frequently
  asked questions, why not remodel the doll so she can fall asleep
  like the instructions say? It is very discouraging for a 9 year
  old who has hopes of seeing the doll do something that is being
  advertised and it does not do that. It is also very upsetting to
  a parent who has to continue going back and forth to a store and
  hopes of looking for a working doll. These dolls are very
  expensive and should work like the instructions say they should.
  We have tried everything we can to get the Love me chou chou doll
  to fall asleep and nothing seems to make that happen.. I have
  even spoken with another parent in the store where the doll was
  purchased and was advised her daughter also was crying on
  Christmas day because they could not get the doll to fall asleep.
  She then explained, she had her mother a grandmother to rock the
  doll and guess what the doll finally fell asleep keep in mind
  this was not rock-a-bye chou chou. We have even tried to rock

  mistake. Have you ever been so utterly sure of something so
  blantantly, painstakingly obvious that it would literally take an
  entirely different, alien planet to be able to even minutely
  comprehend the vast insipidness of its vacuous residents? That's
  how I felt after watching this movie and realizing that
  apparently I'm the only goddamn human being on this prosaic,
  infantile planet who immediately saw the dimwitted aberration for
  what it was! And what exactly was this stupendous error, you ask?
  Well... It's very simple. I mean, it couldn't get more common
  sensically moronic than this. The basic plot of the film is four
  teenagers trapped in an old war bunker. The movie begins with
  Thora Birch's rendition of what happened: that her friend set
  this whole thing up, locked them in the 'hole' and didn't come
  back when he was supposed to. She escapes and the three others
  die. The story changes from what she originally told her
  psychiatrist to what actually happened. Turns out the only way
  out was actually locked from the inside and Thora had the key the
  whole time. The other teenagers die for various reasons,
  irrelevant to the blunder at hand, and she ends up telling the
  tale to her psychiatrist from inside the bunker. In the end, she
  kills the guy who set it up and plants the key on him. The police
  come and find Thora and her psychiatrist in the 'hole' and after
  rebuking the psychiatrist, mention that the case is now closed.
  At that moment, a flashback shows Thora murdering her friend that
  set everything up and planting the key on him. Right after that
  moment, I said to myself: "What the heck? The door locks from the
  inside?! It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that
  either a) the door was never locked, or b) someone had to unlock
  it from the inside!" Alright, those weren't my exact words, but
  good god, it's so obvious! And that, my friends, has got to be
  possibly the worst film blunder ever</Text>
  <Text category="book">I was really looking forward to both the book
  and the movie. Unfortunately I think both are very much
  overrated. Character development is non-existent. We're supposed
  to believe that the haunted, passive, timid character Dave was an
  all-star shortstop in high school? The book had a great premise
  and good beginning, but went nowhere interesting. The handling of
  Dave's character relies on cliche and we never really get insight
  into the book's most intriguing character.</Text>

  is no reason to do this, as even on the radio, they play the
  entire thing, as it runs about 4 and a half minutes long. The

  <Text category="book">This book sucked because its like an
  autobiography of some idiot who knew nothing about what he was
  doing...his book is mostly life-stories...and stupid ones at
  that...some teeter the line of racism, he emphasizes attempting
  to hex some evil "fat black woman" and he demonizes some other
  young brothers later on in the book, i see most of the reviewers
  overlooked the fact that this guy was kind of out of line with
  his emphasis on "race". And besides that, his 2 or 3 spells and
  such are old and tired...and there is no "self-initiation" for
  the type of Voodoo he's talking about... i am sorry but this book
  was a waste of time and money, i came away from this little book
  knowing not one single solitary grain of anything worth knowing.
  If you looking to learn about Voodoo or Vodun this book will not
  help. His title is also misleading because "Voodoo" ussually
  refers to Hoodoo and "Vodun" ussually refers to the religion but
  this author isnt talking about either one....he's just running
  his mouth on and on and on as if his life-experiences are even
  worth tellin. This book is a great example to why people of a
  foriegn back-ground to African based religions should not write
  books about it as if they could really know but so much.....this
  was a terrible book that this sorry author made about a system he
  obviously knows nothing about</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Therese, Lux, Mary, Bonnie and Cecilia make up
  the five Lisbon girls, ages 13, 14, 15, 16 and 17. Cecilia, the
  youngest, lives in her sisters shadows because they are all older
  and of much more interest to their male neighbors. As a cry for
  help, she slits her wrists and lays down in the bathtub, she
  survived the incident. After a psychiatrist highly impresses upon
  the strict Mr. and Mrs. Lisbon that it would be benificial for
  Cecilia to be exposed to environments which have boys her own
  age, Mr. and Mrs. Lisbon decide to allow the girls to throw the
  one and only Lisbon party. Some of the neighborhood's boys are
  invited over and while the party is in session, Cecilia is pretty
  inanimate, sitting on the couch while her sisters flirt, talk and
  laugh. Midway through the party, Cecilia asks to be excused and
  Mrs. Lisbon - though somewhat reluctantly - allows it. Cecilia
  goes up to her room (on the second floor of a two-story house)
  and jumps out the window, landing on the spiked fence on the
  front lawn of the Lisbon house. In this way, Cecilia Lisbon
  commited suicide. Only four girls remain. The act which Cecilia
  committed did not go at all unnoticed. The father saw her
  immediately, the party ended there and all of the boys went home
  rather glum. Four of the Lisbon's neighbors, four young boys,
  suffered a rapidly growing obsession with the Lisbon girls, who
  were beautiful and a total mystery to the outside world. They got
  hold of Cecilia's diary and tried to explain why she committed
  suicide. The eldest decided Cecilia was a dreamer, and she did
  not think she would fall when she jumped out her window, she
  thought she would fly. With their youngest sister gone, the
  remaining Lisbon girls grow closer to each other, stranding
  themselves further from the outside world. When school starts
  again, they attempt to go on acting as if nothing happened, not
  ever mentioning their youngest sister. The run-of-the-mill
  awkward act is taken part by the rest of the school however. The
  usual profuse apology to the mention of the word "death" and the
  like. Trip Fontaine is the most popular guy in school, the object
  of desire to all of the girls at school... Except for the Lisbon
  girls, which is of no importance to Trip until he sets eyes on
  Lux. Trip cannot help but be enchanted by her flawless beauty. In
  the beginning, he is unsuccessful in his quest to even catch her
  attention for she bluntly shows she's not interested. But after
  his consistent courtship, Lux falls for his charming ways. Trip
  then attempts to convince Mr. Lisbon to let him and three of his
  football team pals take the Lisbon daughters to Homecoming. After
  Mr. Lisbon talks to his wife, he agrees to Trip's request,
  knowing nothing but Trip's sincerity and claimed honorable
  intentions, on the understanding that Trip have all of the Lisbon
  girls returned to the house by curfew. After Trip explains the
  situation to his football peers, he gives in to those who bribe
  him the most handsomely. Meanwhile, the Lisbon girls are picking
  out fabric for the dresses they shall wear to the Homecoming
  Dance. Though one pattern is used for all four dresses, each
  dress looks unique when concentrating on detail. Once they pick
  up the girls, they stop midway to the Homecoming in order to
  smoke, Lux being the only girl volunteering to smoke. They then
  drive to the dance. Trip and Lux sneak away and sneak swallows of
  alcohol. Another one of the Lisbon sisters and her date follow,
  but leave soon afterwards, not being as wild nor daring as Trip
  and Lux. At the time they all decided to meet back at the car so
  they could make the girls curfew, they are all there... Except
  for Trip and Lux, who at that time were alone in the middle of
  the football stadium field. Deciding they must make their own
  curfews, Therese, Bonnie, Mary and their dates leave without
  them. After fooling around, the intoxicated Trip and Lux fall
  asleep in the middle of the football stadium. Trip awakens in the
  middle of the night and leaves Lux there alone. When Lux wakes up
  early the next morning she is confused as to why Trip is not
  there. She takes a taxi home and her parents were worried sick
  (of course). But they take measures as far as pulling the girls
  out of school and stranding them inside the Lisbon residence. The
  girls, in a desperate attempt to hold onto a connection to the
  outside world, begin using morse code to interact with the four
  boys who so closely follow their lives. One of which boys lived
  across the street and the rest which came over daily after this
  in order to contact the girls. Soon following, the boys begin
  talking to the Lisbon girls via phone. One day, the girls invite
  the boys to come over once Mr. and Mrs. Lisbon are asleep. The
  plan being that the boys were to drive the girls somewhere, the
  boys hastily agree. They sneak over and Lux invites them to wait
  inside for her sisters and Lux goes to wait in the car. The boys
  wander down to the basement while waiting for Therese, Bonnie and
  Mary, verbally expressing their hopes for the night. But then
  they realize they have stumbled upon one of the sisters. She had
  hung herself. The boys, scared to death, run all the way home.
  Time passed, things changed, girls came and went... But no matter
  what, those four boys NEVER forgot the Lisbon suicides.
  Ultimately, the movie was nothing short of queer. When trying to
  sum up the story in a few lines (such as "Follow the lives of the
  Lisbon sisters and how they connect to their neighbors. A story
  full of obsession, gossip, lust, love, desire and isolation.")
  the story sounds quite unique and intriguing, but the story fell
  short of that for me personally. Partly because the Lisbon
  sisters really committed suicide for a reason not much deeper
  than isolation. The movie, in places, is also extremely flawed. I
  do not believe Mr. and Mrs. Lisbon could've removed their
  daughters from school for so long without their daughters being
  taken from them by social services. In many parts of the movie,
  they should've used upbeat music to fill the deafening silences.
  The whole movie was filmed in a style that I can truthfully say
  makes me rather bored. I would only suggest this film to,
  perhaps, people who like movies such as "Elizabethtown" which
  Kirsten Dunst is also in. But I personally disliked this movie
  which was not very tasteful and will not be watching it again in
  the future</Text>

  <Text category="book">Perhaps this video will satisfy the readers of
  Lincoln's various works, such as The Sacred Place, The Messianic
  Legacy, and Holy Blood, Holy Grail, or at least show them the
  places discussed in detail within those books. The DVD will
  probably be a fine asset for those currently reading the
  aforementioned books. However, it is simply not successful as a
  stand-alone video or as a video about The Da Vinci Code. The
  narrator, Mr. Lincoln, takes us through the quaint and beautiful
  countryside of the Languedoc, home to the Cathar heresy and the
  Albigensian Crusade, and points out some interesting details in
  his wandering. Yet he rarely ties the details together into a
  coherent picture, and often makes comments that would seem to
  undercut the very idea that he intends to create a coherent
  picture. As well, he relishes in showing the destruction wrought
  to many of these mysterious details by treasure hunters and
  vandals (many inspired, it would seem, by Lincoln's books) and
  repeatedly editorializes against their actions. I finally fell
  asleep at around the 90 minute mark---I cannot imagine what else
  Mr. Lincoln could have found to drone on about for the remaining
  half hour.</Text>

  <Text category="health">After using this product for about a month and
  a half, I began to get very high blood pressure readings
  (157/106). My doctor took my BP on the same day and got 130/80,
  which I also got with my manual cuff. I find that this machine

  <Text category="health">The razor I bought came with packets of this
  gel, as well as the lotion. Possibly due to the consistency, the
  gel gets used up more quickly. It is also not as comfortable to

  difference is menthol. The gel has menthol, so that's why it can
  be irritating. I read a review of shaving basics online, and it
  says always avoid shaving with products containing menthol. The
  lotion, on the other hand, always helps get a better shave, and
  is quite soothing</Text>
  <Text category="health">I thought this hot air brush would make things
  easier by not having to hold a round brush and blow dryer. It's a
  great idea, but it just doesn't work as well as that. First let
  me say I have shoulder length, normal hair, but a lot of it. If I
  air dry, it is slightly wavy. I used the larger of the two
  brushes and found it couldn't get through my hair. So then I was
  using a second hand to try to push the hair against the brush so
  it would curl around it. That didn't work very well, and I wound
  up burning my hands more than once. I also found that I couldn't
  get the same nice curl with this hot air brush that I could get
  by using a regular round brush and dryer. The other major problem
  was that the brush got extremely hot. If you have an idea that
  you'll be able to change from the larger brush size to smaller
  (or the unit without the attachment) or vice versa, you won't
  without getting burned. The attachment--even the end of the blow
  dryer itself--is simply too hot to touch. I was doing things like
  using a hand towel to try to change attachments. The size and
  shape of the unit is also not optimal. I found it too large and
  awkward to use. The off button is located right where your hand
  is, so it's easy to bump. Also, there's no cold shot. If you've
  come to appreciate what that can do for setting a curl, you'll
  probably miss it like I did. Additionally, as another person has
  mentioned, the unit is very loud. You would be wise to buy a
  couple foam ear plugs if you are determined to keep this brush
  and keep your hearing. I don't believe I read any warning about
  the noise, either. It's much louder than my traditional guy-style
  blow dryer. Time wise, I found that I spent much longer trying to
  get my hair dry, and then I wasn't fully satisfied with the style
  as well as the burns and hassle involved in getting there. I gave
  this a try for a few days and then returned it to the store for a
  refund. It made me appreciate the traditional blow dryer and
  round brush. Some things are just not as good as they
  seem.</Text>

  2500 mAh) charge than a "normal" D cell (9000+ mAh.) Fortunately,
  these bogus D cells are easy to spot if the manufacturer prints
  the maximum charge on the packaging--that is, 2000-2500 mAh,
  which is AA cell territory. Additionally, the fakes are much
  lighter than the genuine article--inside is mostly air. Too bad I

  <Text category="dvd">Many people criticized this movie for having
  no plot. Which is a result of many people criticizing the first
  for being too complex. There's just no pleasing some people but
  this movie could have made up for it by having some class or a
  formidable villain. Dougray Scott is pretty much one of the worst
  villains ever and a poor representation of Scottish actors. John
  Woo uses some wonderful Australian scenery but fails to inject
  any sense of excitement to the fight scenes. The gun battles look
  too damn staged and the fist fights are all done in slow-motion,
  which robs them of any realism or hardcore. Seeing as how this is
  a PG-13 the action is also pretty damn tame. Which is a shame
  since Woo is a pro at this. You hardly see any bullets even enter
  bad guys never mind exit. It's all done off screen. If people
  wanted tame violence why on earth did they hire Woo to direct?
  It's a bit puzzling. Although it IS tame it is still darker and
  harder than the original. But the duff biochemical warfare plot
  is pure video game crap. I can't believe Robert Towne had a hand
  in writing this. It's like a rejected plot to a Solid Snake PS1
  game. There's seems to be some focus on making it a James
  Bond/Die Hard wannabe instead of respecting the source material
  and offering us any iconic or memorable set-pieces. Another major
  thing that is wrong with this movie however is Zimmer's score.
  For a movie that is 124 minutes long we get about 30 minutes of
  music. Zimmer is known for his talent of creating ambient and
  versatile music. But NONE of that is present in MI-2. This was
  movie was made around the time of his decline into mass-produced
  soulless stuff. Which is also a shame. It's the wrong plot, the
  wrong director and the wrong approach that turns this into a
  movie for idiots. They really under-estimated the audience and
  fumbled the ball with this one. John Woo's original cut was 3.5
  hours long. None of that footage is on this new 'Special Edition'
  DVD. What a waste</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">-Not a great one here, entertaining for all
  the wrong reasons, mainly because the film is so bad, so often.
  -It is nice to see Christina Ricci in a movie again, as she's
  usually good even in a bad movie and doesn't do too bad here.
  -Wes Craven directs this one and I could tell right away it must
  have been do to a contract obligation (much like Edward Norton in
  "The Italian Job"). I could tell this because very little effort
  seemed to be put into the script, both the story and lines of
  dialogue were very predictable and dumb. Also very little effort
  seemed to be put into the effects, as they were very lousy at
  times, especially when they finally showed the werewolf. -As I
  said before, quite predictable the story was, both Ricci and her
  brother get bitten by a werewolf after they try to save a girl
  who got into a car wreck. Then both try to figure out what's
  wrong with them, though the brother is much more active about it
  than Ricci. -It's also quite obvious who the main werewolf was,
  the film tries a bit of a swerve, but it doesn't really work.
  -Besides Ricci, the cast includes Shannon Elizabeth (American Pie
  1&amp;amp;2), Portia De Rossi (Arrested Development), Joshua
  Jackson (Pacey on "Dawson's Creek"), Scott Baio (don't ask me
  why) among others. All do pretty poor jobs, besides Ricci that
  is, the rest don't really seem to care, not that I blame them
  that is. -There is some humor throughout the film, but a lot of
  the film will get unintentional laughs from those who watch it.
  -The only reason to watch this is to make fun of it as the effort
  is not really there by mostly anybody on the cast or crew.</Text>

  actually hurts people, like a bear or a mountain lion? Ignorance,
  that's why. The wolf is also depicted as stupid and easy to trick
  in this book. See, near the end, the children try to trick the
  wolf by telling him he can become immortal by eating gingko nuts.
  They plan on luring him into their trap, to get rid of him. The
  wolf instantly falls for it, which is lame. Wolves are among the
  most intelligent and perceptive animals on Earth! It's
  practically traditional to make children's books with wolves as
  villains, and the Chinese seem to loath wolves, but this book
  crosses the line. Don't let your kids read it unless you want
  them to think wolves are savage, stupid, man-eating beasts. If
  they already think so, you'd be neglecting mankind's need to know
  things even more by letting them read it. In other words, it's a
  terrible book.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I'm not sure how this toy ended up with a 4.5
  star rating after all the broken microphones!! Ours was yet
  another that broke within 2 months of gentle play. It wasn't
  thrown or dragged around by the microphone or anything of the
  sort. My son loved it and figured out the microphone very
  quickly. He loved to see the lights and the little puppy "dance"
  when he "sang" into the microphone. I continued to let him play
  with it even after the microphone shorted out and the static
  began and he still kept trying the microphone until he got
  frustrated and then I finally put it away. I wish I had spent the
  money on something that would have lasted longer. My son is now
  18 months old and the only other toy he has ever managed to break
  was the Vtech Nursery Farm which was broken 3 weeks after
  Christmas last year, just before this piano broke. I highly
  recommend Fisher Price or LeapFrog toys over Vtech. We have never
  had a problem with their toys and 2 of the 3 Vtech toys we have
  owned have broken on us. Garbage!</Text>
  <Text category="book">This is one of the worst-written programming
  books I have seen yet. I'm sorry I bought it. It appears to be
  written by a man who knows quite a bit about finance, and
  dangerously little about C++ programming. Duffy's review
  correctly describes the main flaws. I would add that (1) The book
  is not structured to build upon OO, GOF Patterns, or STL design
  principles; (2) The code does not follow even basic C++ coding
  conventions; (3) The images (screenshots) are agonizingly
  UNREADABLE; (4) The code listings are in ITALICS using a
  variable-pitch font [is COURIER font code listing so difficult to
  include in a $100 book???]; (5) No over-arching component object
  model is suggested ANYWHERE in the book. Some of the efforts at
  brevity are just plain WRONG or even DANGEROUSLY WRONG to teach
  beginning programmers. For example, Pg 19 Data Types section:
  ---------------- int - holds integer numbers up to a little over
  2 million, for example, "int I = 2000000;." long - same as int.
  ---------------- WRONG, PROFESSOR! This is not only a
  syntactically incorrect example, but a just plain wrong
  assertion. If the reader does not know how to determine the
  (platform-specific) size of an "int" or "long", then the author
  has only served to confuse the matter further! Furthermore, I
  consider it a "cheapskate" tactic to ask readers to pay for the
  code from this book in electronic form (particularly when the
  book's code listings are so sloppy). That said, I would not use
  the code, even if it had been supplied for free ... but it
  *might* have been interesting to have something to play around
  with... Have any of the reviewers actually USED any code from
  this book without substantial refactoring? The only use I could
  see for this book is for intermediate-advanced fin-techs, who
  want to review a few general algorithms for selected derivative
  calculations (futures, forwards, etc) ... but just be prepared to
  squint and suffer through reading the code</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">Apologies to those of you who seem to actually
  like this film, but when I re-watched it recently after not
  having seen it in ten years or so, I found it to be . . . well,
  nearly unwatchable. What's so bad about it? Well, how shall I
  begin . . . (1) Sean Connery is a dud. There can be very little
  doubt that Connery is THE James Bond, but here, he seems like
  he's just going through the motions. To be fair, he had no decent
  material to play. The only positives in the performance are the
  small little touches he puts in to show that he is playing an
  aging 007; he seems suitably worn-out at various points, and that
  adds a tiny layer of believability to the character that has
  never been there before. But these are grace notes; by and large,
  Connery is stiff as a board here. (2) The action scenes are
  uninspiring. I'm not the biggest fan of the Roger Moore Bond
  films, but even the worst of them have terrific action scenes.
  Here, the action is strictly second-rate. (3) Kim Basinger and
  Barbara Carrera, though great to look at, give terrible
  performances. (4) There is literally no reason to see this in
  favor of "Thunderball," of which it is a remake; the original
  remains one of the all-time great screen entertainments, and this
  remake makes ZERO improvements. In fact, the plot merely becomes
  muddled. (5) There are a series of awful performances in
  supporting roles. Rowan Atkinson's comic scenes, though brief,
  are painfully unfunny, not to mention out of place. The actor
  playing the "new" M is odious; and whoever it is playing Q isn't
  very good, either. (6) The music is bad. The title song is
  boring, and the score by Michel Legrand frequently sounds as if
  it came from a Bugs Bunny cartoon. I couldn't care less that the
  James Bond theme is missing; it's not what isn't there that's
  bad, it's what IS there. All in all, I'd have to say that --
  unless we're counting the 1967 version of "Casino Royale" -- this
  is THE worst of the James Bond movies. It's worth seeing if
  you've never seen it before . . . but that's about it, in my
  opinion</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">First, let me say, I LOVE Koyaanisqatsi, the
  original film in this trilogy. Koyaanisqatsi is a true visual
  poem that tells a straight forward story about what we humans are
  doing to the earth. The second film in the trilogy, Powaqqatsi,
  wasn't as good as the first but it was still fairly
  understandable as a critique of how humans exploit one another.
  Naqoyqatsi could have been the best in the series since it had
  ample opportunity to show us the horrors of war. Instead, it
  comes off as a sophomoric exercise in video experimentation,
  nothing more. If not for Philip Glass' music, I would not have
  given this film any rating at all. I write this criticism in
  hopes that Godfrey Reggio sees it. He should pull this travesty
  off the market and reshoot the entire film with stronger footage
  showing us, as clearly as he did with "Koy", why war (the topic
  of "Naq") is so horrific. If you want an effective critique of
  violence, try "Clockwork Orange". Naqoyqatsi is simply a
  mess</Text>

  <Text category="book">To cover all the problems with continuity,
  logic, theology, geography and plain common sense in _Left
  Behind_ would take a whole book. One hardly knows where to start.
  Perhaps it is too early to assess the damage that will be done to
  Christian religion by this trashy novel. As such, it isn't even a
  decent trashy novel; instead of steamy sex scenes, we get
  sanctimonious sermonizing. Worse than that, what the authors have
  done is to turn the powerful imagery of the Bible into a cheap
  comic book, ignoring its spiritual messages in favor of promoting
  a self-centered preoccupation with getting a ticket to heaven
  before it's too late. The comic book aspect can not be
  overemphasized. Even if you suspend disbelief enough to accept
  the rapture scenario (an idea with virtually no scriptural
  support), little in the characters' actions, thought processes or
  dialog rings true. One gets the impression that the book was
  hastily thrown together by a junior high school student. God ends
  up looking like the ultimate villain, demanding that you hurry up
  and get yourself and your friends on his side Or Else. Whatever
  happened to the inspiring Christian writers of yesteryear? Who is
  the present-day equivalent of C. S. Lewis, or Catherine Marshall,
  and why aren't they getting more attention? These were writers
  who actually made you THINK. LaHaye and Jenkins seem to believe
  that thinking is the last thing God wants us to be doing; they
  hardly miss a chance to put down anyone with any hint of
  intelligence or independent thought. They show no interest in
  answering the sort of hard questions that surviving non-believers
  in such a world might ask. One wonders if they have ever met a
  non-believer at all, or witnessed the aftermath of a disaster for
  that matter. These days, it seems as if all the media attention
  is on the likes of Ann Coulter or Pat Robertson, whose mission
  seems to be to turn Christianity into a twisted, bigoted
  caricature of what it once was. Perhaps all the great religious
  thinkers really have been raptured. If _Left Behind_ is an
  example of the sort of writing that we can expect from Christian
  writers, then it is the church itself that is in danger of being
  left behind</Text>

  her really medicore scripts to look at. Good Advice was Bad
  advice for her. It is miscast with two annoying stars; Sheen and
  Richards...and some of the worst scenes and dialoge ever in a
  movie. It has no redeaming values at all and Angie deserves

  This is two packets of colored dust, approximately the
  consistency of unmixed plaster. Empty the plastic bags and the
  colored dust flies everywhere, mold it in your hand and it
  retains its shape for a few seconds before blurring and falling
  apart. My wife and I repeatedly checked the packaging to see if
  we should add water or do something else to make this usable but
  apparently not. The claim on the package is that it "Molds like
  Dough," obviously intended to remind us of Play-doh, but Play-doh
  is a clay-like material that retains its shape and can, in fact,
  be molded. This material -- again attempting to compare itself to
  Play-doh -- states that it won't dry out. Of course not! It's
  dust! It can't dry out, there's nothing drier than dust. In case
  you're wondering I have no connection to Play-doh or its makers
  (I don't even know who does make it), I'm simply the father of a
  3-year old who uses Play-doh often and hoped this product might
  be a workable addition to our playtime. Wrong</Text>
  <Text category="book">I was barely able to finish this book.
  Armstrong makes fun of vampires and witches, etc. by dragging in
  all the cheesy pop culture references she can think of. This made
  it very hard for me to take her characters seriously. I might
  have been able to swallow the idea of Cabals (giant glitzy
  corporations run by sorcerors; it's unclear why they don't just
  take over the world and have done), but Armstrong really lost me
  during the 20-page extended send-up of Anne Rice's vampires. This
  genre is rapidly sinking into self-referentialism, and Armstrong
  is the worst culprit. In Industrial Magic, she ruins what could
  have been a perfectly good story with these unfunny namechecks
  and rebuttals to writers who are actually better than she is. On
  top of that, the viewpoint character, Paige, is unfortunately
  named: she's as flat and boring as the pages she's written on.
  Her central relationship is with her boyfriend, Lucas, but their
  coupleship seems to revolve around the trading of sexual favors.
  Are we supposed to think this is cute and funny? Take-home
  project for Armstrong: next time, try putting some genuine
  emotion into your work</Text>

  <Text category="book">First off: I'd like it better if we had
  1/2-star options. Judas Unchained really doesn't deserve a 2,
  more a 2-1/2 or 2-3/4. I have a love/hate relationship with Peter
  Hamilton's books. He's very adept at introducing interesting
  technology and making a faster-than-light society plausible but,
  as with a lot of these hard-science, libertarian SF authors, he
  badly needs an editor. I was skipping over multiple pages of
  irrelevance in both this book and its prequel, Pandora's Star. He
  also has far too many "main characters" who (despite 800+ pages)
  never seem to come alive. They all speak with essentially the
  same voice. And when he tries to individualize someone they come
  off as badly stereotyped '60s era hippies -- come on, does anyone
  seriously say "dude" in the real world much less the imagined
  future of the 24th century? And why is Hamilton so obsessed with
  sex with young (or rejuvenated) women? Hamilton's treatment of
  virtual immortality is hit and miss at best. On the one hand, the
  innate conservatism of an immortal civilization is well
  developed, represented and believable. On the other hand, the
  dynamics of the relationship between "old timers" and "first
  lifers" is unsatisfactory. In four centuries, for example, NO ONE
  has even attempted to unseat Nigel Sheldon from his position as
  head of the Sheldon dynasty? Perhaps the Commonwealth's continual
  expansion is the safety valve but even here, the government
  (controlled the eternal heads of these dynasties) controls it.
  Another point that is brought up briefly is why would anyone want
  to live forever if their life didn't change -- I mean the
  characters of a novel (almost by definition) are dynamic,
  go-get-'em types but most people just plod through their lives
  and then die. Why would anyone want to do that for lifetime after
  lifetime? The aliens are OK. The problem with them (and this is
  true of nearly every SF story) is that they tend to be one
  dimensional -- they're all of a singular type and all too often
  they really do just act like human beings with weird make up.
  (This is a problem in fantasy stories, too.) On the plus side, I
  do tip my hat to Hamilton for not allowing the humans to save
  themselves with an alien "deus ex machina." Ozzie's adventures in
  "Wonderland" (i.e., the silfen paths) do bring him to the adult
  silfen and he does find out the origins of the Dyson barriers but
  the knowledge doesn't really help anyone defeat the Primes.
  Overall, if you started with Pandora's Star, you probably should
  finish the journey with Judas Unchained. If you haven't started
  down this "silfen path," I recommend Alistair Reynolds, Tony
  Daniel or Iain Banks. They write similarly grand space opera but
  are better at it than Hamilton has proven himself to be to

  <Text category="dvd">I bought this for the Jeffrey Dahmer and John
  Wayne Gacy documentaries, like I imagine you might. I'm not
  disappointed really, I don't regret buying it in any sense, it's
  just that this DVD isn't very good at all. It doesn't attempt to
  make any insight, which isn't something I particularly care for
  anyway. What each documentary offers is a limited and quite dated
  view of the serial killers. I can't imagine anyone learning
  something they didn't already know from them. It's mostly told
  through pictures when it seems there's option to use video. The
  Dahmer documentary, made in 1993, doesn't feature anything of
  interest. There's no interview with his father or anything, just
  a voice telling a story over pictures we've all seen before, with
  occassional clips of victims' families in court. The Gacy one,
  made in '96, is the same. There's also a program, made in 1997,on
  criminal profiling. This look at three farely well known killers
  whose capture supports profiling. It's told often with video
  rather then photos, which is good, but still they're somewhat
  boring subjects. The Criminal Profiler, Dahmer, and Gacy are all
  episodes from the A&amp;amp;amp;E series Investigative Reports,
  if you didn't realise. The last program is on Charles Manson.
  It's quite different from the others on the disc. Made in 1997,
  it originally aired on television as Biography: Charles Manson:
  Journey Into Evil. I don't with have any interest in Manson, but
  I guess it's ok. It features significant interviews with Manson
  and main female members of the Family. All programs run for about
  one hour or more. I wouldn't reccomend any of them, none are good
  at all. I might even describe them as terrible, considering what
  else is out there</Text>

  relieved to see the (then) mostly positive reviews. However, I

  very misleading. I would not, in good faith, be able to recommend
  this series of books for learning Spanish. This series of books
  was VERY confusing and EXTREMELY difficult to work with. Some of
  the many issues with using this series of books to learn spanish:
  1) the concepts are not clearly explained (they invented a "new"
  english word for one) and the exercises are excessively
  complicated and do not give you enough practice with the
  vocabulary/concepts to feel confident using them. 2) Frequently,
  new words, phrases and concepts are introduced in the middle of a
  lesson about something else, via a footnote, with no further
  explaination provided!! This is SUPER frustrating and
  distracting! 3) Using this series of books is very cumbersome,
  the books are not well coordinated with one another, and do not
  appear to reinforce each other's concepts or vocabulary. I'm very
  sorry, but these books are just terrible, and 4.5 stars is not at
  all reflective of the quality of these books... Using this series
  of books has taken ALL the fun out of learning Spanish, which I
  used to enjoy. If you have the option to use different books,

  <Text category="book">I purchased this book at Walmart, which rarely
  carries books regarding Shambala or any other Eastern ideology.
  It was cheap and on the clearance rack. I should have know
  better. When I realized this was part three in a series I decided
  to read the first two books, The Celestine Prophecy and The Tenth
  Insight in order to be able to better appreciate the third one.
  After borrowing and reading the first two, I realized what a sham
  this series truly is. First, I realize they are supposed to be
  fictional. However, when a work of fiction attempts to use
  historical background for its premise, the author should first do
  his homework and make sure the historical facts are completely
  accurate. Additionally, when usurping a mythical name such as
  Shambala, one should know what the actual mythology entails,
  instead of making up one's own notion of what is involed.
  Shambala is NOT the same as Shangri-la. Shangri-la was a
  fictional community in a book written in early 20th century
  Western culture. Shambala is an ancient Eastern mythical kingdom
  that is in no way similar to the fictional place in Redfield's
  imagination. Also, beware of writers who combine religions and
  mythologies. As Joseph Campbell said many times in his lectures
  and books, they all contain the truth as seen by different
  cultures, but they must never be mixed together. It just doesn't

  <Text category="dvd">Here we have what has to be one of the most

  What is going on? Is it me or them that has totally lost the plot
  of what movies are supposed to be all about? Am I naive to think
  that movies should first and foremost entertain? Where oh where
  was the entertainment in this lame effort of a film with its
  unsteady shaky comera work,hamfisted confusing screenplay lacking
  energy and inventiveness and the cloying performance of modern
  cinema's most tedious and overrated sleep inducing actor Ralph
  Fiennes? How I long for the good old days when we had great
  movies with great actors from great writers and great directors

  <Text category="music">I've seen and heard Sheryl live when she's not
  surrounded by rock and roll dinosaurs. She's great - she's hip,
  self-assured and kicks butt! But here, she tells the audience in
  "Leaving Las Vegas": "I'm playing Central Park tonight... but I
  have some friends coming up so can you be patient...Please? For
  lil' ol' me? Be very patient...." almost begging the audience not
  to walk out while she's singing solo. It's almost as if she knows
  that the audience will have to suffer her solo attempts until the
  "friends" arrive. The irony is that Sheryl solo is the best part
  of the album. With the others on board, we can't see what Sheryl
  can do, and those familiar with her know that Sheryl is capable
  of a lot. She's overwhelmed by Keith Richard, Stevie Nicks, Eric
  Clapton, Chrissie Hynde and by including so many rock gods she
  herself is diminished in importance and stature. Her songs "It
  Don't Hurt" and "There Goes the Neighborhood" stand out on the
  album showing that Sheryl can rock harder and better than any of
  her "friends." Too bad she didn't include "Am I Getting Through"
  -- the Part 2 of that was a great rock moment. Natalie Maines'
  grating voice (like fingernails on a chalkboard) completely ruin
  "Strong Enough." Chrissie sounds like a zombie on "If It Makes
  You Happy", Sarah McLaughlin is so hopelessly unhip and
  white-bread in her Lilith-Fair mode that she adds nothing to "A
  Difficult Kind"...in fact, by the end of the song Sarah seems to
  disappear from the song as Sheryl belts it to the end. That's
  Sheryl's song and should remain so, Tombstone Blues stands out
  for its guitar work and the best part of "All I Wanna Do" is the
  New York audience. Happy, White Room and Gold Dust Woman are
  three classic rock standards, so overplayed that anyone who grew
  up to 70's FM AOR radio has heard them ad nauseaum. Problem here
  is that nothing new is added to them, they sound like karaoke
  versions. Despite Sheryl's plea for patience, I was bored with
  the old-timers.They didn't bring Sheryl's career forward, only

  <Text category="book">I'm not a cosmologist, but Stephen Hawking's
  Universe was so simply written it is essentially condescending.
  The language is akin to the level one would read in a newspaper.
  Moreover, the pictures are second rate pre-contact lense Hubble
  knock-offs (despite being published in 1997), and the book has
  very little to do with Stephen Hawking. Sure, he wrote the
  foreward and did some editing, but it lacks the wit and wonder of
  a Hawking work. Naming the book after him and putting his picture
  on the front is misleading. I AM a chemist, and despite this,
  Filkin's descriptions of Chemical discoveries left even me
  guessing because he was attempting to dumb-down ideas that aren't
  dumb-downable, and didn't include diagrams which would be helpful
  for anyone trying to understand the concepts (like neutrino
  capturing or particle acceleration). If you want to learn some
  cosmology, read &amp;amp;quot;A Brief History of

  <Text category="book">Apparently the difference between a criminal
  act (theft) and moral redistribution of income is 1) who you
  steal from (stealing from the wealthy, of course, is moral --
  according to Rawls and Bolsheviks), and 2) who receives the loot
  (the non-wealthy makes it moral), and 3) who commits the act (the
  state/society, of course also makes theft moral; example -
  taxation), and 4) your intentions (redistribution of income). To
  look at this another way, if your neighbor breaks into your house
  and steals your money, that's a crime (unless your neighbor is
  poor -- which would then be moral and Justice, according to
  Rawls' formula). If the community comes into your house and
  steals from you, it's legal and moral Justice, again, according
  to Rawls. Because, according to Rawls, if, before you were born,
  you were to vote with everyone on how physical world society
  should be structured, you'd vote to have the state guarantee that
  everyone was equal, or they would be compensated somehow for
  being born (unjustly) less-equal. How? By compensating those with
  less by stealing from those with more. So those with more would
  be like oh, say ... a milk-cow who gets milked to serve those
  with less. So those with more would become a resource, or
  state-owned slaves to those with less ... because "society" (the
  Robin Hoods and Rawls of the world) deemed this as moral Justice.
  Rawls does not take into account those who are willing to take on
  risk, entrepreneurs, students of life who work to earn an "A" vs.
  students who earn an "F". He points out that many people are born
  into difficult situations through no fault of their own. True.
  But that does not implicate those within society who are born
  into better situations as the cause, nor are those who are born
  into better situations responsible for making up the difference.
  Forcing the "wealthier" ones to be accountable for the unfairness
  within life and pay the bill isn't Justice or moral. It would
  simply be an unjust law. Some people see Rawls' theory as a
  blueprint for a future generation utopia (like the Bolsheviks
  envisioned Marxism). I see it as an insane blueprint for slavery,
  and a powerful dis-incentive for earning personal reward and
  merit. In a sense, this book is an argument against the
  individual. It sees the world through a blurred lense where the
  author only recognizes masses of people -- he doesn't recognize
  any individuals (unless they were born as victims). Curious. How
  do you experience life ... as a group-mind (an oxymoron if there
  ever was one), a collective? Or as a unique, isolated,
  independent, individual? There should be societal incentives to
  help each other. Okay. But when it is forced (theft of property
  always implies force), it is no longer an issue of morality or
  justice -- it's simply a law. Without personal choice being
  involved there is no morality as an issue, by definition.
  Transforming advantaged individuals into mules forced to carry
  the burdens of the world is a definition of justice for
  whom?</Text>

  they&amp;#x1A;believe of course that&amp;#x1A;they can
  see&amp;#x1A; beyond these.`` ''Philosophy&amp;#x1A;&amp;#x1A; is
  a battle against the bewitchment of our&amp;#x1A;intelligence by
  means of language`` ``Ambition is the death of
  thought'''&amp;#x1A; These three quotes are from Ludwig
  Wittgenstein who redefined philosophy&amp;#x1A;some&amp;#x1A;70
  years ago (but&amp;#x1A; most people have&amp;#x1A; yet to find
  this out).&amp;#x1A;Dennett, though he has been a
  philosopher&amp;#x1A; for some&amp;#x1A;40 years, is one
  them.&amp;#x1A; It is also curious that both he and his prime
  antagonist, John Searle, studied under famous Wittgensteinians
  (Searle with John Austin, Dennett with Gilbert Ryle) but Searle
  got the point and Dennett did not. Dennett is a hard
  determinist(though he trys to sneak reality in the back door),
  and perhaps this is due to Ryle, whose famous book 'The Concept
  of Mind'(1949) continues to be reprinted. That book did a great
  job of exorcising the ghost but it left the machine. Dennett
  enjoys making the&amp;#x1A; mistakes Wittgenstein,
  Ryle(and&amp;#x1A;many others since) have exposed in detail.
  By&amp;#x1A;accident,just before this book, I had read
  ''The&amp;#x1A; Minds I'', which Dennett coauthored
  with&amp;#x1A;Douglas Hofstadter in 1981.&amp;#x1A; They made
  some&amp;#x1A; bad mistakes(see my review), and saddest of all,
  they reprinted two&amp;#x1A;famous articles that pointed the
  way&amp;#x1A;out of the mess---Nagel's&amp;#x1A; `What is like
  to&amp;#x1A; be a bat?` and an&amp;#x1A; early version
  of&amp;#x1A; John Searle's&amp;#x1A; Chinese Room
  argument&amp;#x1A; explaining&amp;#x1A; why computers don't
  think.&amp;#x1A;&amp;#x1A; Nagel pointed out that we do
  not&amp;#x1A;even know how to recognize what&amp;#x1A;a concept
  of a bat's mind would&amp;#x1A; be like.&amp;#x1A;
  Searle&amp;#x1A; similarly explained&amp;#x1A; how we lack a way
  to conceptualize&amp;#x1A; thinking and how
  it&amp;#x1A;&amp;#x1A;differs&amp;#x1A;from what a computer
  does(eg,&amp;#x1A;it can translate Chinese without&amp;#x1A;
  understanding&amp;#x1A; it).&amp;#x1A; Likewise, we lack a clear
  test for recognizing what counts&amp;#x1A;as&amp;#x1A; good
  vs&amp;#x1A; bad--or just intelligible-- for many philosophical
  and scientific concepts.&amp;#x1A;&amp;#x1A; Our use&amp;#x1A;
  of&amp;#x1A;&amp;#x1A; the words consciousness, choice, freedom,
  intention, particle,&amp;#x1A; thinking,&amp;#x1A; determines,
  wave,&amp;#x1A;cause, happened, event(and so on&amp;#x1A;
  endlessly)&amp;#x1A; are rarely a&amp;#x1A; source of confusion
  but&amp;#x1A; as soon as we leave normal&amp;#x1A; life and enter
  philosophy(and any&amp;#x1A;discussion detached&amp;#x1A; from
  the environment in which language&amp;#x1A; evolved)&amp;#x1A;
  chaos&amp;#x1A; reigns.&amp;#x1A;&amp;#x1A; Wittgenstein was the
  first to understand why&amp;#x1A; and to&amp;#x1A; point out how
  to avoid this. Unfortunately, he died in&amp;#x1A;his prime, his
  works are composed almost entirely of a series&amp;#x1A; of
  examples of how the mind(language) works&amp;#x1A;and he never
  wrote&amp;#x1A;any popular books, so understanding of his work
  is&amp;#x1A; restricted&amp;#x1A; to a very few. Searle is one
  of&amp;#x1A; the world's leading&amp;#x1A;philosophers&amp;#x1A;
  and has written many&amp;#x1A;extremely clear and highly
  regarded&amp;#x1A; articles&amp;#x1A; and books,some of which
  have pointed out the glaring&amp;#x1A; defects&amp;#x1A; in
  Dennett's&amp;#x1A;work.&amp;#x1A;His review
  ``Consciousness&amp;#x1A; Explained&amp;#x1A;&amp;#x1A; Away'' of
  Dennetts 1991 book&amp;#x1A;`'Consciousness Explained''&amp;#x1A;
  and&amp;#x1A; his book&amp;#x1A;''The Mystery of Consciousness''
  are&amp;#x1A; very&amp;#x1A; well known,and show, in a way that
  is&amp;#x1A;amazingly clear for philosophical writing,why neither
  Dennett(nor any of the&amp;#x1A; hundreds of
  philosophers&amp;#x1A;and&amp;#x1A;scientists who have written on
  this topic)have&amp;#x1A;come
  close&amp;#x1A;to&amp;#x1A;explaining the hard problem--ie, how
  do you conceptualize&amp;#x1A;consciousness.&amp;#x1A;Many
  suspect we&amp;#x1A; will never be able to
  conceptualize&amp;#x1A;any of the really&amp;#x1A;important
  things, but it is&amp;#x1A;clear that we are nowhere&amp;#x1A;
  near it&amp;#x1A; now.&amp;#x1A; Dennett has mostly&amp;#x1A;
  ignored his critics but has&amp;#x1A; favored Searle
  with&amp;#x1A; vituperative personal&amp;#x1A;
  attacks.&amp;#x1A;Searle has been accused by Dennett and others
  of being out to destroy cognitive psychology which is quite funny
  as modern philosophy is(mostly) a branch of cognitive psychology
  and Searle has made it very clear for 30 years that WE are a good
  example of a biological machine that is conscious, thinks, etc,.
  He just points out that we don't have any idea how this happens.
  Searle characterizes as
  ''intellectual&amp;#x1A;pathology'',&amp;#x1A;the views
  of&amp;#x1A;Dennett and&amp;#x1A;all those who deny&amp;#x1A;the
  existence of the&amp;#x1A;very phenomena they set&amp;#x1A;out to
  explain.&amp;#x1A; Dennett repeats his mistakes here
  and&amp;#x1A;leaves his reply to his&amp;#x1A; critics to the
  penultimate page of the book, where we are told&amp;#x1A; that
  they are&amp;#x1A;all mistaken and it is a waste of
  space&amp;#x1A;to show&amp;#x1A; how!&amp;#x1A;&amp;#x1A;
  Unsurprisingly, there is&amp;#x1A;not one reference
  to&amp;#x1A;Wittgenstein&amp;#x1A; or Searle in
  the&amp;#x1A;entire book.&amp;#x1A;There are&amp;#x1A;however,
  many references&amp;#x1A; to other old
  school&amp;#x1A;philosophers who are as confused&amp;#x1A;as he
  is.&amp;#x1A; Like most people, it does not cross his
  mind&amp;#x1A;that&amp;#x1A;the very&amp;#x1A; inference
  engines&amp;#x1A;he thinks with are forcing&amp;#x1A;him to
  come&amp;#x1A;to certain&amp;#x1A;conclusions and that
  these&amp;#x1A; will often&amp;#x1A;be quite
  unconnected&amp;#x1A;with or wrong about&amp;#x1A; the way things
  are in the&amp;#x1A; world. They are a jumble of evolutionary
  curiosities&amp;#x1A;which do various tasks in organizing
  behavior that were useful for survival&amp;#x1A;hundreds of
  thousands of years ago.&amp;#x1A;Wittgenstein was a
  pioneer&amp;#x1A;in doing&amp;#x1A;thought experiments in
  cognitive&amp;#x1A; psychology&amp;#x1A;and began&amp;#x1A;to
  elucidate the nature&amp;#x1A; of these engines and the
  subtleties&amp;#x1A;of language in the 30's, and thus he
  made&amp;#x1A; the sorts of comments&amp;#x1A;that this review
  begins with.&amp;#x1A; Dennett says(p98)that his view is
  compatibilism, ie, that free will(which&amp;#x1A;I
  hope&amp;#x1A;we can equate with choice) is compatible with
  determinism(ie, that&amp;#x1A;''there&amp;#x1A; is at any instant
  exactly one physically possible&amp;#x1A;
  future''--p25).&amp;#x1A; He&amp;#x1A; wants to show that
  determinism is not the same as inevitablity.&amp;#x1A; However,
  the&amp;#x1A; whole book is smoke and&amp;#x1A; mirrors by means
  of which choice, in the sense we&amp;#x1A;&amp;#x1A; normally
  understand&amp;#x1A; it, disappears and&amp;#x1A; we are left
  with ``choice``, which is&amp;#x1A; something&amp;#x1A; we cannot
  choose.&amp;#x1A; Naturally, this echoes the fate of
  consiousness&amp;#x1A; in&amp;#x1A; his earlier book
  ``Consciousness Explained``. It is remarkable&amp;#x1A; that, at
  a time&amp;#x1A; when we are just beginning to reach the
  point&amp;#x1A; where we might be able to&amp;#x1A; understand
  the basics of how a single&amp;#x1A; neuron works(or how an atom
  works for that&amp;#x1A; matter), that anyone should&amp;#x1A;
  think they can make the leap to understanding the whole&amp;#x1A;
  brain&amp;#x1A; and to explain its most complex
  phenomena.&amp;#x1A; Please recall the last&amp;#x1A; sentence of
  Wittgenstein from the opening quote: ''&amp;#x1A;And
  what's&amp;#x1A;more,&amp;#x1A;this&amp;#x1A; satisfies a longing
  for the&amp;#x1A;transcendent, because, insofar
  as&amp;#x1A;&amp;#x1A;people&amp;#x1A;think&amp;#x1A;they can see
  `the limits of&amp;#x1A;&amp;#x1A; human
  understanding',&amp;#x1A;&amp;#x1A;they&amp;#x1A;believe&amp;#x1A;
  of course that&amp;#x1A;they can see beyond these.``
  The&amp;#x1A; relation between language,&amp;#x1A; thought and
  reality is extraordinarily&amp;#x1A; complex and everyone gets
  lost.&amp;#x1A; If one&amp;#x1A; is very, very
  careful,&amp;#x1A;some understanding is possible, but Dennett
  throws&amp;#x1A; caution to&amp;#x1A; the winds and we are
  dragged into the quicksand.&amp;#x1A; There&amp;#x1A; are at
  least 3 different topics here(evolution of our brain,
  choice&amp;#x1A; and morality) and Dennett tries vainly to weld
  them together into&amp;#x1A; a coherent&amp;#x1A; account of how
  freedom evolves from the deterministic&amp;#x1A; crashing of
  atoms.&amp;#x1A; There&amp;#x1A; is, however, no compelling
  reason to&amp;#x1A; accept that bouncing atoms (or his
  favorite&amp;#x1A; example, the game&amp;#x1A; of life running on
  a computer) are isomorphic with reality.&amp;#x1A;&amp;#x1A;
  He&amp;#x1A; knows that quantum indeterminacy(or the uncertainty
  principle) is&amp;#x1A; a major&amp;#x1A; obstacle to determinism
  however defined(and has been taken&amp;#x1A; by many as an
  escape&amp;#x1A; to freedom) but dismisses it due to the
  fact&amp;#x1A; that such events are too rare to&amp;#x1A; bother
  with.&amp;#x1A; By&amp;#x1A; extension,&amp;#x1A; its unlikely
  that any such event will happen now or even in our&amp;#x1A;
  whole&amp;#x1A; lifetime in our brain, so we appear to be stuck
  with a determined&amp;#x1A; brain(whatever&amp;#x1A; that may
  be). However, the universe is a big place&amp;#x1A; and its been
  around a long&amp;#x1A; time(perhaps forever) and if even
  one&amp;#x1A; such quantum effect occurs it would seem&amp;#x1A;
  to throw the whole universe&amp;#x1A; into an indeterminate
  state.&amp;#x1A; The notion ''there&amp;#x1A; is&amp;#x1A; at
  any&amp;#x1A; instant exactly one physically possible future''
  cannot be true&amp;#x1A; if at any&amp;#x1A; instant a quantum
  indeterminacy can occur--in this case&amp;#x1A; there would seem
  to be&amp;#x1A; infinitely many possible futures.&amp;#x1A;
  This&amp;#x1A; recalls one of the escapes from the&amp;#x1A;
  contradictions of physics--each&amp;#x1A; instant our universe is
  branching into&amp;#x1A; infinitely many universes. He correctly
  rejects the idea that quantum indeterminacy gives us the answer
  to how we can have choice. This obvious idea has been suggested
  by many but the problem is that nobody has any idea how to
  specify an exact sequence of steps which starts with the
  equations of physics and ends up with the phenomena of
  consciousness(or any other emergent phenomenon). If so, they will
  definitely win at least one Nobel Prize, for not only will they
  have explained consciousness, they will have explained the
  universal phenomenon of emergence(how higher order properties
  emerge from lower ones). So, they would have to solve the 'easy'
  problem(to determine the exact state of the brain corresponding
  to some mental state and preferably specify the exact position of
  all the atoms in the brain over time-ignoring uncertainty) and
  the 'hard' one(what exactly correlates with or produces
  consciousness or choice etc?). And while they are at it how about
  also doing the impossible--an exact and full solution to the
  quantum field equations for a brain. It is very well known that
  these equations are uncomputable, even for one atom or a vacuum,
  as it would require an infinite amount of computer time. But
  infinite will do for one atom so maybe a brain will take no
  longer. He starts off on the first page appealing to the
  laws&amp;#x1A; of physics for&amp;#x1A; protection against
  fantastic notions such as immaterial souls, but physics
  is&amp;#x1A; made of notions just as
  fantastic(uncertainty,&amp;#x1A; entanglement,
  wave/particle&amp;#x1A; duality, Schrodinger's
  dead/alive&amp;#x1A;cat etc) and as Feynmann said many
  times&amp;#x1A; ``Nobody understands&amp;#x1A;physics!'' Many
  think nobody ever will. On pg 2 he says our values have&amp;#x1A;
  little to do with the goals of our&amp;#x1A; cells and on pg 2
  to3 that&amp;#x1A; our personality differences are due to how
  our&amp;#x1A; ''robotic teams&amp;#x1A; are put togther, over a
  lifetime of growth and experience.``&amp;#x1A;&amp;#x1A;
  This&amp;#x1A; is a bald dismissal of human nature, of the
  abundant evidence that&amp;#x1A; our&amp;#x1A; differences are to
  a large extent programmed into our genes&amp;#x1A; and fixed in
  early&amp;#x1A; childhood, and is typical of his constant
  confused&amp;#x1A; wandering back and forth&amp;#x1A; between
  determinism and&amp;#x1A; environmentalism. On page 9 he notes
  that free will is&amp;#x1A; a problem and our attitudes to it
  make&amp;#x1A; a difference, but for whom?&amp;#x1A;&amp;#x1A;
  Nobody but philosophers.&amp;#x1A; We&amp;#x1A; make
  choices.&amp;#x1A;&amp;#x1A; What's the problem?&amp;#x1A; One
  has to step outside life to experience&amp;#x1A; a&amp;#x1A;
  problem and then everything becomes a problem.&amp;#x1A; What are
  consciousness,&amp;#x1A; pain,&amp;#x1A; yellow, intention,
  matter, quarks, gravity etc.?&amp;#x1A; I doubt&amp;#x1A; that
  anyone has ever&amp;#x1A; experienced a fundamental change in
  their&amp;#x1A; interactions with people or their&amp;#x1A;
  decision making processes due&amp;#x1A; to their thinking about
  choice.&amp;#x1A; This shows that&amp;#x1A; there is
  something&amp;#x1A; strange about such questions.&amp;#x1A;
  Wittgenstein would probably&amp;#x1A; say&amp;#x1A; that the
  language games are different.&amp;#x1A; There are&amp;#x1A; games
  for language&amp;#x1A; connected with the cognitive templates for
  decisions or seeing&amp;#x1A; colors etc, and&amp;#x1A;&amp;#x1A;
  thinking philosophically is operating&amp;#x1A; them in decoupled
  mode.&amp;#x1A;&amp;#x1A; Decoupled modes permit thinking
  about&amp;#x1A; the past, planning for the future,&amp;#x1A;
  guessing the mental states&amp;#x1A; of others, etc, but if one
  takes the results in the&amp;#x1A; wrong way and&amp;#x1A; starts
  to think `'John will try to steal my wallet'', rather&amp;#x1A;
  than&amp;#x1A; just imagining that John might do it, confusion
  enters and&amp;#x1A; those who cannot turn&amp;#x1A; off the
  decoupled mode or distinguish it from coupled mode, enter the
  realm of&amp;#x1A; pathology.&amp;#x1A; Some aspects of&amp;#x1A;
  schizophrenia and other mental illness might be seen
  this&amp;#x1A; way--they lose control of which mode they are in,
  eg, not&amp;#x1A;being able to see&amp;#x1A; the difference
  between the motives people have and the motives&amp;#x1A;
  they&amp;#x1A; might have. &amp;#x1A;One can then see much of the
  philosophizing&amp;#x1A; people do as operating in&amp;#x1A;
  these decoupled modes but failing to&amp;#x1A; be able to keep in
  front of them the&amp;#x1A; differences from the normal&amp;#x1A;
  mode.&amp;#x1A; Normal mode--eg, what is that lion
  doing--&amp;#x1A; was undoubtedly&amp;#x1A; the first one evolved
  and decoupled modes--what did that lion do&amp;#x1A; last time or
  what does he intend to do next--evolved
  later.&amp;#x1A;&amp;#x1A; This was probably&amp;#x1A; never a
  problem for animals--any animal that&amp;#x1A; spent too
  much&amp;#x1A; time worrying about&amp;#x1A; what might happen
  would not&amp;#x1A; be very successful contributing to the gene
  pool.&amp;#x1A;&amp;#x1A; It is interesting&amp;#x1A; to
  speculate that only when humans developed culture and
  began&amp;#x1A; degenerating&amp;#x1A;genetically, could large
  numbers of people survive with genes that&amp;#x1A; led them to
  spend alot of time in decoupled modes.&amp;#x1A; Hence,
  we&amp;#x1A; have philosophy&amp;#x1A; and this book, which is
  mostly about running the&amp;#x1A; decision templates in
  decoupled&amp;#x1A; mode where there are no real
  consequences&amp;#x1A;except earning royalties for
  putting&amp;#x1A; the results in a book for&amp;#x1A; other
  people to use to run their engines in decoupled&amp;#x1A; mode.'
  Let us alter Wittgenstein's quote to read: ''As
  long&amp;#x1A;as&amp;#x1A; there&amp;#x1A; continues&amp;#x1A; to
  be a verb 'to decide'&amp;#x1A; that looks as if&amp;#x1A;
  it&amp;#x1A; functions&amp;#x1A; in the&amp;#x1A;&amp;#x1A; same
  way as 'to eat' and 'to drink',&amp;#x1A;as&amp;#x1A;&amp;#x1A;
  long as we continue&amp;#x1A;to talk of freedom&amp;#x1A; of
  action, of&amp;#x1A; saying&amp;#x1A; I wish I had done
  otherwise, etc., etc., people will&amp;#x1A;
  keep&amp;#x1A;stumbling&amp;#x1A; over the same&amp;#x1A;puzzling
  difficulties and&amp;#x1A;find themselves staring&amp;#x1A;
  at&amp;#x1A;something&amp;#x1A;which&amp;#x1A; no
  explanation&amp;#x1A; seems capable of clearing&amp;#x1A;
  up.&amp;#x1A;'' As with&amp;#x1A;most philosophy books, nearly
  every page,&amp;#x1A; often every paragraph, changes from
  one&amp;#x1A; type of language game&amp;#x1A; to another without
  noticing that now one would have to be&amp;#x1A; joking&amp;#x1A;
  or dreaming or acting in a play or reciting a story , etc, and
  not&amp;#x1A; actually intending anything nor describing an
  actual situation&amp;#x1A; in the world.&amp;#x1A; On&amp;#x1A;
  page 10 he says we count on free will for the&amp;#x1A; whole way
  of thinking about our&amp;#x1A; lives, like we count on food
  and&amp;#x1A; water, but who ever, outside philosophy,
  standing&amp;#x1A; in front of lunch&amp;#x1A; counter full of
  food, ever thinks how fine it is that they&amp;#x1A;
  have&amp;#x1A; free will so they can pick coke instead of mineral
  water?&amp;#x1A; Even&amp;#x1A; if I want&amp;#x1A; to be a
  serious compatibilist and try&amp;#x1A; thinking this&amp;#x1A;
  in decoupled mode, I have&amp;#x1A; to exit and enter
  nondecoupled mode&amp;#x1A; to make the actual choice.&amp;#x1A;
  Only then can I&amp;#x1A; go back to decoupled&amp;#x1A; mode to
  wonder what might have happened if I had not had&amp;#x1A; the
  ability&amp;#x1A; to make a real choice.&amp;#x1A; Wittgenstein
  noted how pretend games are&amp;#x1A; parasitic on real ones(this
  is not a trivial observation!).&amp;#x1A; The ability to engage
  in very complex&amp;#x1A; decoupled&amp;#x1A; scenarios is
  already evident in 4 year old children.&amp;#x1A;&amp;#x1A; So I
  would say that&amp;#x1A; normally, nobody counts on having
  choice,&amp;#x1A; but rather we just choose.&amp;#x1A; On the
  same page he shows&amp;#x1A; again that he does not grasp
  cognitive basics.&amp;#x1A;&amp;#x1A; He says we learn&amp;#x1A;
  to conduct our lives in the conceptual atmosphere of
  choice,&amp;#x1A; and&amp;#x1A; that `'It appears to be a stable
  and ahistorical construct, as&amp;#x1A; eternal and&amp;#x1A;
  unchanging as arithmetic, but it is not.'' And on&amp;#x1A; page
  13--''It is an evolved&amp;#x1A; creation of&amp;#x1A; human
  activity and&amp;#x1A; beliefs''.&amp;#x1A; The whole thrust of
  cognitive&amp;#x1A; psychology is that&amp;#x1A; we do NOT learn
  the basics of planning, deciding, promising,&amp;#x1A;
  resenting,&amp;#x1A; etc, but that these are built-in functions
  of the inference engines&amp;#x1A; that work automatically and
  unconsciously and start running in&amp;#x1A; very early&amp;#x1A;
  childhood.&amp;#x1A; There is no evidence that they
  change&amp;#x1A; as we grow, or are in any way&amp;#x1A; subject
  to our beliefs,only that&amp;#x1A; they mature just&amp;#x1A; as
  our body does.&amp;#x1A; On pg 14 he suggests its
  probable&amp;#x1A; that our having free will depends on
  our&amp;#x1A; believing we have it! Do&amp;#x1A; we believe we
  see an apple, feel a pain, are&amp;#x1A;
  happy?&amp;#x1A;&amp;#x1A; The language&amp;#x1A; game of belief
  is very different from that of knowing.&amp;#x1A; We&amp;#x1A;
  can&amp;#x1A; believe we have a dollar in our pocket but if we
  take it out and&amp;#x1A; look at it&amp;#x1A; we can't
  meaningfully then say that we still believe&amp;#x1A; it(except
  as a joke etc.).&amp;#x1A; The inference engine can run in
  decoupled(belief)&amp;#x1A; mode so we can imagine
  having&amp;#x1A;choices or making them, but in life&amp;#x1A; we
  just make them and it is only in very odd&amp;#x1A; situations we
  can&amp;#x1A; say that we believe we made a choice.&amp;#x1A; But
  Dennett is saying&amp;#x1A; this&amp;#x1A;is the universal
  case.&amp;#x1A; If making a choice had any dependence
  on&amp;#x1A; belief&amp;#x1A; than so would everything everything
  else--consciousness,&amp;#x1A; seeing,
  thinking,etc.&amp;#x1A;&amp;#x1A; If we take this seriously(and
  he says&amp;#x1A; 'the serious problems of free will' )
  then&amp;#x1A; we are getting into&amp;#x1A; trouble and if we
  actually try to apply it to life, then&amp;#x1A;
  madness&amp;#x1A; is minutes away. . On page 65 et seq., he
  discusses&amp;#x1A; causation, intention and the
  `informal&amp;#x1A; predicates' that we use&amp;#x1A; to describe
  atoms etc, but cognitive resarch has shown&amp;#x1A; that
  we&amp;#x1A; describe all objects with a limited number of
  ontological categories&amp;#x1A; which we analyse with our
  intuitive physics modules and that when&amp;#x1A; agents
  (ie&amp;#x1A; animals or people or things like them--ie, ghosts
  or&amp;#x1A; gods) are involved we use&amp;#x1A; our concepts
  (engines) for agency, intuitive&amp;#x1A; psychology, social
  minds, etc to&amp;#x1A; decide how to behave.&amp;#x1A;
  There&amp;#x1A; is almost certainly no causation module but
  rather&amp;#x1A; it will involve&amp;#x1A; all of these and other
  inference engines, depending on the&amp;#x1A; precise&amp;#x1A;
  situation. Discussing&amp;#x1A; possibility and necessity is
  much&amp;#x1A; easier&amp;#x1A; if one talks in terms of the
  output of our modules for&amp;#x1A; intuitive physics,&amp;#x1A;
  agency, ontological categories etc.&amp;#x1A; Of course&amp;#x1A;
  there is no mention here of&amp;#x1A; Wittgenstein's many
  incisive comments&amp;#x1A; on causation, intention, deciding,
  nor of&amp;#x1A;&amp;#x1A; Searle's now classic&amp;#x1A; works
  on Intention and Social Reality. He spends much&amp;#x1A; time on
  Ainslie's book 'Breakdown of Will', in which is&amp;#x1A;
  discussed&amp;#x1A; the hyperbolic discounting faculties (ie,
  inference engines) by which&amp;#x1A; we evaluate probable
  outcomes. He&amp;#x1A;makes much of the excellent work of Robert
  Frank on altruism, emotion and&amp;#x1A; economics, but the book
  he cites was 15 years old when this book was published. It was
  Bingham's idea, amplified by Frank and by Boyd and Richardson
  (1992) that&amp;#x1A; cooperation was&amp;#x1A; greatly
  stimulated by the evolution of means for punishing&amp;#x1A;
  cheaters.&amp;#x1A;&amp;#x1A; He suggests these as examples of
  Darwinian approaches that are&amp;#x1A;obligatory&amp;#x1A; and
  promising.&amp;#x1A; Indeed they are, and in fact they are
  standard&amp;#x1A; parts&amp;#x1A; of economic, evolutionary and
  cognitive theory, but unfortunately,&amp;#x1A; he makes&amp;#x1A;
  little reference to the other work in these fields. All that work
  tends to show that people do not choose but their brains choose
  for them. He does not establish any convincing&amp;#x1A;
  connection between this work and the general problem of
  choice.&amp;#x1A; On&amp;#x1A;pg 216 he says that making oneself
  so that one could not have done&amp;#x1A; otherwise is a key
  innovation in the evolutionary ascent to free&amp;#x1A; will, and
  that&amp;#x1A; we can only be free if we learn how to render
  ourselves&amp;#x1A; insensitive to&amp;#x1A; opportunities. But
  where this ability resides is&amp;#x1A; not revealed for
  several&amp;#x1A; chapters!&amp;#x1A; Dennett has a
  penchant&amp;#x1A; for hiding his ideas in a massive amount
  of&amp;#x1A; rather irrelevant&amp;#x1A; text.&amp;#x1A; Again,
  he gets things backwards, as there is a vast body&amp;#x1A;
  of&amp;#x1A; very good evidence from biology and psychology that
  we are get the&amp;#x1A; feelings&amp;#x1A; that we should behave
  in some way from our inference&amp;#x1A; engines and these are
  not&amp;#x1A; provided by some part of our conscious&amp;#x1A;
  self, but by the automatic and&amp;#x1A; unconscious operation of
  the engines.&amp;#x1A;&amp;#x1A; As he notes, hundreds of
  experiments with the&amp;#x1A; Prisoner's Dilemma and
  related&amp;#x1A; protocols have shown how easy it is to
  manipulate&amp;#x1A; people's choices&amp;#x1A; and that their
  calculations are not conscious and deliberate at&amp;#x1A;
  all.&amp;#x1A; When the situation is manipulated to make them
  conscious,&amp;#x1A;they are much slower and less reliable. So,
  there&amp;#x1A; has been constant pressure of&amp;#x1A; natural
  selection to make the engines&amp;#x1A; fast and automatic and
  inacessible to&amp;#x1A; deliberate thought. Dennett says `we
  make ourselves' so that we could not do&amp;#x1A;
  otherwise&amp;#x1A; and that this is the basis of morality and
  choice.&amp;#x1A; The evidence&amp;#x1A; would&amp;#x1A; seem to
  be exactly the opposite.&amp;#x1A; Our inference engines give us
  basic&amp;#x1A; moral intuitions and&amp;#x1A; we generally act
  in accord with the results.&amp;#x1A;&amp;#x1A; If we or others
  do not we feel&amp;#x1A; guilt, outrage, resentment
  etc,&amp;#x1A; then cheater genes will invade the population and
  this is one of the main theories as to how a good part of
  morality evolved.&amp;#x1A;Our genes make us so we can't(mostly)
  do otherwise, not our will or whatever Dennett thinks can do it.
  We can&amp;#x1A; often choose to do otherwise but our own
  intuitions and the knowledge of social&amp;#x1A; disapproval
  usually serve to limit our choices.&amp;#x1A; These
  intuitions&amp;#x1A; evolved in&amp;#x1A; small groups between
  50,000 and some millions of years ago.&amp;#x1A; In the modern
  world&amp;#x1A; the intuitions are often not to our&amp;#x1A;
  advantage and the social controls weak.&amp;#x1A;&amp;#x1A; This
  is a prime reason&amp;#x1A;for the chaos in the world.
  On&amp;#x1A; pg 225 he finally sneaks in a definition
  of&amp;#x1A; free&amp;#x1A; will&amp;#x1A; as ''a complicated
  snarl of mechanistic causes that look like&amp;#x1A;decision
  making(from certain angles)''. He claims that this&amp;#x1A;plays
  all the valuable roles&amp;#x1A; of free will but lacks some
  (unspecified)&amp;#x1A; properties possessed by&amp;#x1A;
  traditional free will.&amp;#x1A; The smoke is thick but I
  am&amp;#x1A; pretty sure one of&amp;#x1A; those unspecified
  properties is what we understand
  as&amp;#x1A;choice.&amp;#x1A;&amp;#x1A; He insists(top pg 226)
  that his naturalistic account of decision&amp;#x1A;
  making&amp;#x1A; leaves plenty of room for moral responsibility,
  but making&amp;#x1A; ourselves so we&amp;#x1A; couldn't do
  otherwise does not seem to describe&amp;#x1A; the way we actually
  function,&amp;#x1A; nor does it seem to leave any room&amp;#x1A;
  for morality, as that would seem to consist&amp;#x1A; precisely
  in being&amp;#x1A; able to do otherwise. He does not propose any
  test&amp;#x1A; for deciding if a choice is voluntary or&amp;#x1A;
  forced and I doubt he&amp;#x1A; could do so.&amp;#x1A; Normally
  if someone asks us to move our&amp;#x1A; hand, we&amp;#x1A; know
  what counts as having a choice,&amp;#x1A; but, typical of
  philosophers,&amp;#x1A; I&amp;#x1A; expect that regardless of
  whether it moves or not he will count&amp;#x1A; both as evidence
  for his position. At this point he also starts his discussion of
  Libet's well known work on conscious attention which is the only
  part of the book that I felt was worth my time. On page 253
  et&amp;#x1A; seq., he sneaks in his definition of conscious
  will--the&amp;#x1A; ''brains&amp;#x1A; user illusion of itself'''
  which has as one of its main roles&amp;#x1A; providing&amp;#x1A;
  ''me with the means of interfacing with myself at&amp;#x1A; other
  times``. And&amp;#x1A; ``Illusory&amp;#x1A; or not, conscious
  will is the&amp;#x1A; persons guide to his or her own
  moral&amp;#x1A; responsibility for action.``&amp;#x1A; He says
  the trick we need is to see that ``I`'&amp;#x1A; control what
  is&amp;#x1A; happening inside the ''simplification barrier''...
  ''where&amp;#x1A; decision making happens''. ``Mental events''
  become conscious&amp;#x1A; by ''entering into&amp;#x1A;
  memory''.&amp;#x1A; ''The process of self
  description...&amp;#x1A; is what we are''.&amp;#x1A; The
  crucial&amp;#x1A; thing is that choice is possible&amp;#x1A;
  because the self is distributed over space(the&amp;#x1A; brain)
  and time(memories).&amp;#x1A;&amp;#x1A; He realizes this is going
  to leave many incredulous(everyone who can follow this and really
  understands!).&amp;#x1A; ''I know that many people find it hard
  to grasp&amp;#x1A;this idea or take it seriously.&amp;#x1A; It
  seems to them to be a trick&amp;#x1A;with mirrors,&amp;#x1A; some
  kind of verbal slight of&amp;#x1A; hand that
  whisks&amp;#x1A;consciousness, and the real&amp;#x1A; Self , out
  of the picture just when&amp;#x1A; it was about to be
  introduced.''&amp;#x1A; Many will say he took the words out of
  their mouth, but I would say it's incoherent and
  that&amp;#x1A;everything&amp;#x1A;we know about consciousness and
  the whole universe(making the obvious extensions of such claims)
  was gone long before&amp;#x1A;we&amp;#x1A;got this far.&amp;#x1A;
  On pg 259 he says that culture has made us rational animals! This
  is a stunning denial of human nature(ie, genetics and evolution)
  coming from the person who wrote 'Darwin's Dangerous Idea''!
  Presumably he is talking about his idea that it is memories
  spread over space(the brain and other people) and time that give
  us choices and morals and consciousness(line 6 from bottom). He
  says consciousness is a user-interface but it is never made clear
  who or where the user is and how it interfaces with the brain(you
  will have to suffer through 'Consciousness Explained to find that
  there is no answer there either). Though he makes many references
  to evolutionary and cognitive psychology, he seldom uses any of
  the terminology that has been current for decades(social mind,
  intuitive psychology, coalitional intuitions etc) and clearly is
  not familiar with most of the concepts. If he means that we got
  the fine details of morality from culture, thats ok, but this is
  the icing on the cake and the cake was baked by the genes. We are
  also told here that R&amp;amp;D(by which he means evolution here,
  but other things elsewhere) has given us the self and that
  language creates new kind of consciousness and morality. I am
  sure that he will get little agreement on this. It seems quite
  clear that consciousness and the basics of morality evolved in
  primates(and earlier) long before spoken language(though it is a
  very deep topic as to how language evolved from extant capacities
  in the brain). He continues ``morality memes arose by accident
  some tens of thousands of years ago`` which would be OK if he
  meant the icing on the cake but he clearly means the cake! And
  then he says the point of morality is not the survival of our
  genes, which is an amazing (and totally incorrect)thing to say,
  even if he was only referring to memes. On pg 260 he claims that
  because&amp;#x1A; we do not comprehend our ''bland&amp;#x1A;
  dispositions to cooperate'',&amp;#x1A; they mean nothing to us,
  but it is the operation of&amp;#x1A; our templates&amp;#x1A; that
  is everything to us.&amp;#x1A; There is ample evidence that if
  one&amp;#x1A; of&amp;#x1A; them is damaged a person cannot
  function properly as a social being(eg, autism). I would say it
  is the operation of the templates for intuitive psychology etc
  which lead Dennett to the counterintuitive views that we do not
  have consciousness and choice in the way we think. He also says
  here that it was one of the major evolutionary transitions when
  we were able to change our views and reflect on reasons for them.
  This again reflects his lack of understanding of evolutionary
  psychology. I know of no evidence that the basic moral
  intuitions, like all the templates, are accessible to
  consciousness. We may decide our cheating was justifiable, or
  forgive someone else's cheating, but we still know it was
  cheating(ie, we cannot change the engine). I suspect my ancestors
  a million years ago had the same feelings in the same situation
  but what has happened is that there are lots of other things that
  may be taken as relevant and that sometimes these will lead me to
  act contrary to my feelings. Another issue is that as culture
  developed, one had to make many important or 'moral type`
  decisions for which the engines were not evolved to give a clear
  answer. On pg 267 he says that we now replace our `free floating
  rationales'(probably corresponding to what cognitive
  psychologists call our templates or inference engines) with
  reflection and mutual persuasion. And on pg 286 he says that it
  is a child's upbringing --demanding and giving reasons-- that
  affects moral reasoning. Again, he just has no grasp of what has
  happened in the last 30 years of research--the templates do not
  change with reflection or upbringing. We are then told again that
  consciousness makes moral issues available over time to the self,
  which takes responsibility. It is not any more coherent or
  credible with repetition. On pg 289 he has a chapter summary
  which repeats the mistaken notions that it is culture that makes
  it possible to reflect and that choice depends on
  education(memory) and sharing. It's clear that it is not culture
  but the inherited cognitive structures that make it possible to
  reflect and to choose and that culture determines the acceptable
  actions and their rewards or punishments. On pg 303 he discusses
  the classic philosophical barrier between 'ought'and 'is' ,
  unaware that our templates solved that problem long ago--ie, they
  tell us how to feel about situations regarding other people. He
  also seems to be unaware that there are hundreds of cultural
  universals implanted in our genes(eg see 'The Blank Slate'). He
  often starts into what looks like its going to be a good
  discussion of some issue in evolutionary psychology, but
  invariably wanders off into philosophical arcana and winds up
  with more confusion. This happens on pg 261 where he states that
  concepts like 'praiseworthy' were shaped over millennia by
  culture, while most would say the basis for such concepts is in
  the genes and each culture only detetermines the details of
  acceptable reactions to the intuitions its members get from their
  innate mechanisms. On pg 262 he tries to explain how an
  ESS(Evolutionarily Stable Strategy) can produce morality. His
  idea here is that genetic `R&amp;amp;D` produces dim
  understandings of morals and then culture(memetics) produces
  variations and clarifications. I would say that we all know, and
  much research has made clear, that we commonly get very clear
  results from our inference engines and only dimly understand in
  special cases. Culture merely decides what we can do about our
  feelings. The last part of the book is mostly concerned with
  moral culpability.&amp;#x1A; He refers to the legal classic by
  Hart and Honore, which I started reading 30 years ago since it's
  authors were deeply influenced by Wittgenstein.&amp;#x1A; Dennett
  tells us that we have control over our own morality and that
  thinking about morality will improve us.&amp;#x1A; But, there
  seems no justification whatever for this view in this book. There
  is nothing at all here to help anyone escape from the dictates of
  the monkey mind.&amp;#x1A; It is a defensible point of view that
  those who manage this do so by traveling a spiritual path that
  has no connection with philosophy- and there is not a hint of
  spirituality in this entire book--another telling point
  considering that many mystics have fascinating things to say
  about the functioning of the mind.&amp;#x1A; I find more wisdom
  about how to be free and moral in any of Osho's 200 books than
  anywhere in philosophy. One rarely finds spiritually and morally
  advanced people teaching at universities.&amp;#x1A; There is no
  sign here, nor in anything he has done, that Dennett is morally
  superior.&amp;#x1A; After 40 years of thinking about morality he
  launches personal attacks on his critics or arrogantly dismisses
  them. It seems clear that, like all of us, he is trapped in the
  limits of his inference engines. So, how much opportunity is
  there to improve our morality?&amp;#x1A; It seems clear(eg, see
  Pinker's `The Blank Slate`) that most of our behaviour is genetic
  and the rest due to unknown factors in our environment, in spite
  of the vigorous efforts of parents and religions and political
  parties. On average, maybe 5% of the variation in moral
  behavior(variations are the only thing we can study) is due to
  our own efforts.&amp;#x1A; The moral choices that matter most
  today are those affecting the fate of the world.&amp;#x1A; But
  our moral templates were not evolved to deal with overpopulation
  and the greenhouse effect. How remarkable it would be if just one
  of the hundreds of millions of educated people in the world
  managed to figure out what consiousness or choice or any mental
  phenomenon really is. And if one did, we would expect them to be
  a scientist at the cutting edge of research using some exotic
  fMRI equipment and the latest parallel processing neural
  networked fuzzy logic computer etc. But a philosopher or
  physicist just sitting there thinking, coming up with the
  solution to the greatest puzzle there is! And then writing a
  whole book about it without checking with the sceptics first. To
  return to the quote at the beginning--'Ambition is the death of
  thought'. Indeed--though clearly Wittgenstein was thinking of
  interesting thoughts</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This edition of the film sucks and sucks
  again. The wide screen version of this is a Masterpiece - without
  the widescreen ratio this edition cannot be true to the comic
  book sensibility that Bava intended. Each shot was carefully
  composed(and not intended to be butchered) - this edition is a
  travesty -- especially when it's purported to be put out by fans
  - do you're homework. There are also scenes missing from this
  print, scenes that are important and add to the overall ambience.
  Hey I thought the folks behind this were enthusiasts -- instead
  its just sloppy and self indulgent. Look for the earlier laser
  disc edition ........... as for the extras do we really need the
  - it's great because I used it in my video slop .... and it's
  great because I did a bad homage/rip-off slop. The documentary in
  the extras takes great pains to point out that this film was
  intended to look like a comic book and that's what was great
  about it. Then when you watch the film what you get is less than
  a third of the original image! Strikes me a total scumminess. All
  in a all a fabulous opportunity wasted ... by a few lazy
  lard-asses with a quick-fix mentality.</Text>

  rip-off price. They could make a great profit selling these
  refills at something like $2.50 each, their rip off price of
  $8.50 ea is beyond absurd. The other thing is that when you buy
  their toothbrush they have something in there like the brush
  heads last 2 months. That's a real laugh. Even brushing just once

  <Text category="dvd">This movie ended where Tyrese Gibson and
  Meagan Good meet up again in Mexico. But heck, they are both
  fugitives hiding from the law. How is this a proper happy ending?
  Although, I will admit, Meagan Good is a fine looking young lady.
  Just knowing that she was in this film, got me to want to watch
  it. However, I don't understand the appeal of these kinds of
  films. Violent "black/gangsta" films with lots of foul language,
  gun-play, and just bad tempered attitudes. Even that music sounds
  like it would stir up hatred and provoke violence and harm to
  anyone just passing by. I wish people would get rid of that "What
  are you looking at?" mentality that just seems to encourage fear
  to innocent people just passing by. My wife is asian, and her
  older sister married an Hispanic guy. We go to their house every
  Thanksgiving and Christmas. Nothing makes my holidays more
  depressing than to have to go over to his house and have to watch
  these violent "gangsta" movies, with his kids. I'm trying to
  teach my kids to not have any prejudices of other races, but
  these kinds of films make the black race look bad. There wasn't
  very many positive messages in this movie. And if black people
  are so offended by the use of the "N" word, then why do they keep
  using it themselves? If it's such an offensive term, then they
  need to stop using it themselves. These kinds of movies promote
  and glorify the ugly side of being black in the "big city". Black
  people need to do more movies with more "positive" themes. We
  gotta work together if we're going to diminish our black and
  white prejudices. I wish my brother-in-law would stop having this
  kind of crap on his TV when I have my children over. It's hard to
  talk to him about it, especially when he thinks there is nothing
  wrong with our kids watching these kinds of films. What's more,
  it's hard to reason with someone that has to use the "F" word in
  every sentence. I'm really beginning to struggle with my
  prejudices within my own family.</Text>
  <Text category="health">I've been kinda exclusive to Remington MS3's
  for a few years. They've just been had inexpensively here and
  there so that's the main reason I've stuck it out. But in all
  honesty, these seem to cost me more than I've thought in the
  past. Like other reviews have stated, this razor takes effort to
  get close. Hair does collect on the foils and thus as I've
  noticed, causes the blades to bind on stubble. I'm a patient
  person, not usually in a hurry to shave, so again not too big a
  deal after a quick cleaning. But here's the weakness: the foils
  are like paper, and flake holes in them. I just purchased the
  2700 right before the holidays for about 25 bucks (a good deal I
  thought for a microscreen 3). My other 0003 was shot and running
  on a foil or two (once a hole developed, and I'd rashed up my
  neck accidentally, I removed the bad foil). I'd bought one foil
  pack before and gradually went through those. So I thought a new
  unit was the trick. Well, now just three months later, the new
  2700 has burned through two foils and is down to two (used a foil
  from the 0003 when the first went out). My bathroom is riddled
  with these things. My patience is now out and I'm headed back to
  an old faithful: Braun</Text>

  <Text category="book">I had high hopes for this game, but played it
  with a friend last night and was appalled at the number of
  confusing questions and just plain incorrect answers. For
  example, one question asks, "Which of these animals is not found
  exclusively in South America: (a) chinchilla, (b) sloth, (c)
  guinea pig, (d) spring buck". Ruling out zoos, my friend reasoned
  that since zillions of kids in the US have pet guinea pigs, the
  answer must be C. Alas, no; the correct answer is "(d) spring
  buck" with no explanation. Did they mean animals in their natural
  habitat? We aren't sure. The question is not clearly written.
  Another question asks, "The word `berserk' is derived from: (a) a
  Norse god; (b) the German for `crazy life', (c) a tropical
  plant". I read this to my friend and said, "None of these is the
  right answer." The word `berserk' comes from the Germanic branch
  of the language tree and means `bear-shirt'. The game says the
  correct answer is "a Norse god. In Norse mythology, the god
  `Berserker' always fought in a state of frenzy." There is no such
  Norse god. Who wrote these questions? One of the aspects of
  trivia games that I enjoy is the prospect of learning something
  in the process of playing; this game concerns me because I do not
  know which answers are incorrect. From a learning standpoint, the
  badly written questions and poorly researched answers make this a
  frustrating and intellectually dangerous game.</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">After reading a couple of other reviews about
  the &amp;amp;quot;quality&amp;amp;quot; of transfer on this dvd,
  I decided I wanted this in my collection. What I THOUGHT would be
  good or atleast a decent enough picture quiality, I WAS VERY
  DISSAPOINTED.THE QUALITY OF TRANSFER OF THE PICTURE IS
  HORRIBLE!!! A great movie a total real diaster flick in picture
  quality. Non anamorphic, deffintaly not remastered or digitally
  transfered. Picture tones are very, very bad, along with what
  little color that is desplayed. Almost a black &amp;amp;amp;
  white picture with most of the entire movie too dark to make out
  what is going on. Even with my brightness turn all the way up on
  my tv, it still was so dark it almost wasn't worth continue
  watching.The ONLY things positive on this dvd was the fact it was
  in widescreen and &amp;amp;quot;suppossedly&amp;amp;quot; in
  Dolby Digital EX. The beginning Dolby intoduction was deffinatly
  in Dolby and had good sound but the movie itself didn't
  distributeand Dolby sounds that I could make out on my theatre
  sound system. Sounded like mono to me.Thsi dvd reproduction
  stinks and I suggest those that are into quality dvd and getting
  you money worth saty away from this &amp;amp;quot;Goodtimes
  Video&amp;amp;quot; version untill it is put on dvd correctly.
  Why they botherd is beyond me. Because I wanted to have a copy of
  this movie in widescreen, I am taping it on to VHS for my
  collection and going to try and return it for something better
  tommorrow. I suppsoe I'll have to be content that I got the
  widscreen version on VHS for now untill they re-release it on dvd
  with better quality, or they show it on tv in widescreen which I
  highly doubt. Heck, even TAPING IT OFF TV YOU'D GET A BETTER
  PICTURE QUALITY THAN THIS DVD</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I didn't enjoy the film. I also didn't enjoy
  the original play by Shakespeare. King Lear is one of my least
  favorite Shakespeare plays. I don't consider it particularly
  creative to remake a play that has already been done, and to add
  nothing of value to the original. You can set it wherever you
  like, in medieval Japan or on the Moon, what's the difference.
  It's King Lear, a downer of a play, there's nothing great about
  Ran just as there's nothing great about Lear, and it takes up
  three hours of your time. A moron named Lear, or Hidetoro, or
  whatever his name is, relinquishes power in his kingdom and turns
  the power over to his oldest son. The youngest son warns him that
  it is a bad idea because the sons will be disloyal to their
  father. He is right, of course, and Hidetoro Lear gets treated
  shabbily. He's wanted dead or dead. In this treatment of the
  annoying plot, he loses his mind. He has a faithful follower or
  two. They overact. There is nobody to root for in this depressing
  and ridiculously overrated downer of a play. Lear Hidetoro is an
  absolute jerk. Am I supposed to care what happens to him? Why?
  Because he used to be a powerful king, and a cruel one? You may
  as well cry over Saddam Hussein. Look at this movie with fresh
  eyes. Look at Shakespeare's King Lear with fresh eyes. This stuff
  simply is not very entertaining, and is not very good. The hell
  with King Lear. He's an annoyance</Text>

  <Text category="music">Mcmurtrys new album really disappoints. I am a
  longtime fan and found the subject matter of the new album
  slipping out of character with James past work (as well as
  somewhat inappropriate and overly cynical). While Mcmurtry has
  had past hits that either hearken back to childhood extravaganza
  (See the Elephant) or that provide an echo to the way we
  Americans spend our time (Holiday), his attempts on Childish
  things came across as an unfortunate mix of trite and depressing.
  In past attempts Mcmurtry was able to find the nuances of the
  positive and the negative of Americana, yet all the remains in
  the stinging lyrics of this album is the over-used and overheard
  downside. The thoughtfulness evaporated on this work. Like many
  aging musicians, Mcmurtry could not resist the tempation to jump
  into personal politics to replace the vacuum of meaningful verse.
  The cliche and empty "We Cant Make It Here" is a meaningless mix
  of 70s era socialism and the ills of modern era entitlement
  policies that displays an ignorance of both democracy and
  personal responsibility. Mcmurtry, previously able to frame an
  issue, seems oblivious that those of different political
  persuasions could easily fit the same song title to a wholly
  opposed set of social ills. Criticism is not intelligence, and we
  can only hope that Mcmurtry can get on track going forward.
  Perhaps he should shun the "PC Crowd" and seek his own space and
  more thoughtful views of the complex but substantial American

  toy i've ever seen, let alone purchased. Also when performing its
  "flip" maneuver, it gets stuck 70% of the time and then makes the
  same screeching motor sound while it repeatedly tries to reset

  <Text category="health">I expected so much and yet recieved so little
  from these so called &amp;amp;quot;batteries.&amp;amp;quot;
  Number one, I was disappointed to find out, after some scientific
  analyses I performed on them, that duracell's world famous
  &amp;amp;quot;copper top&amp;amp;quot; statement is erroneous.
  This so called &amp;amp;quot;copper top&amp;amp;quot; is nothing
  more than a copper-aluminum alloy called copposyclamatrane. I
  can't top the copper top? hardly. After the analyses, I put these
  &amp;amp;quot;copper top&amp;amp;quot; batteries to the test.
  What I did was I stuck them in my flashlight expecting a
  brilliant flashlike-like sheen. What I got was far from. A tiny
  light that could only be classified as much less than miniscule.
  I threw the flashlight at my cat in disgust, expecting hilarious
  results, and I wasn't disapointed! This was the only good thing
  that came out of the worst purchase decision I've ever made.

  write himself into a corner? There was no climax, conclusion, or

  <Text category="book">I am a Jew living in a college town in
  Mississippi for the past 5 years. I was born &amp;amp; raised in
  the North. I think Evans should rename his book "Fiddler on the
  Roof in the South". His book is a very nostalgic look back at
  Jewish history - as it was in the past here. It's very much: the
  southern Jews were all so happy, they all fit in and were
  accepted, etc. He does cite a few instances where they had
  problems - but these usually involved us 'Yankee Jews', like the
  instances when a few (Yankee)Rabbis in the South fought for civil
  rights. Evans should realize that times have REALLY CHANGED HERE!
  The evangelical Christians in my town (which is most people here)
  harrass me like crazy - 'I am praying for you!' 'Have you read
  the words of Jesus, who was a Jew like you?' 'When will you come
  to my Church'. Blah, blah, blah. Thank God for the minority of
  Catholics, Methodists, Presbyterians and a few others who live
  here. They are the only ones to accept me for the way I am, and
  the way I will stay - a Jew. I want all who are reading this to
  realize that I am only speaking for my experience. Jews who
  reside in cities in the South have told me that they have had far
  better experiences, and that they cannot relate to what I am
  saying. But I do want to ask Evans a few questions: 1) If things
  are so great for the Jews in the South: Why have you lived in New
  York for decades now??? 2) Why don't you at least write either a
  new Forward to the book, a magazine article, etc., contrasting
  some of the ways in which the lives of Jews in the South have
  changed over time (for some of us at least), primarily due to the
  rise of the evangelical Christians? I read Evans' books before I
  moved here, and nothing much he describes in his books is my life
  here. For a Jew who really cares about her/his religion living
  here is depressing; it is practically Jew-less; and, at best, the
  majority of a certain denomination of Christians here ignore me.
  (By the way, I am planning to move to a city!) By the way, don't
  bother writing to me to tell me that I am "wrong", or to invite
  me to things like the Bible Study at your Church. Believe me,
  with all the praying for me that is going on in this town, and
  all the myriad attempts to convert me, if it hasn't happened by
  now, as they say in these parts, it just ain't gonna
  happen</Text>
  <Text category="book">I was so disappointed in this book. I don't
  find a closeness to God in the pages. Instead it seems
  intellectual. It contains beautiful sounding prayers that are
  more like poetry than speaking with God face to face. Even though
  it contains prayers from across the ages it seems to keep me
  distant from the personal God I seek. And though the author's
  prayers are included too, I feel the same about them. I expected
  more from Richard J. Foster</Text>
  <Text category="book">The chocolate war The chocolate war was one of
  the best books I have ever read...NOT! The chocolate war
  portrayed a very inappropriate scene. The boy jerry was supposed
  to sell chocolates but refused, but the book sidetracks and talks
  about naughty things and also swears a lot. I would not recommend
  this book because it seemed inappropriate. I don't think that
  this book should be available to children at a middle school
  level. This story might be better if the bad words and other bad
  things war taken out. I think that the story line seems great
  when jerry denies selling the chocolates because of Archie.
  Archie is a suspicious character that knows every one. I wish
  this book was more school appropriate, but it isn't and was a
  horrid book. Therefore, this book would be great if the author
  published a book with the Sam story but more school appropriate
  situations and words</Text>

  <Text category="music">First of all, I am a fan of Madonna's music
  (not all of it, but a lot of it) as well as a huge ABBA fan. Now
  I realize that sampling has been very successful for many
  artists... and apparently it is here as well, but why can't these
  producers make something more intriguing or dynamic? Gimme Gimme
  Gimme (the ABBA song that is sampled here) is a fairly simple
  song to begin with (as many ABBA songs are) but the complicated
  arrangements (both vocally and instrumentally) are what made
  ABBA's songs interesting and fun to listen to. But taking a few
  bars of the original song, repeating it over and over and over,
  adding a dance beat, various other musical effects and a new
  melody does not add up to a pop masterpiece. I think she would've
  been better off either following a similar chord progression to
  Gimme Gimme Gimme or just doing a cover... Perhaps Benny and
  Bj&amp;#x1A;rn should've stuck to their strict "no sampling" rule
  here! For some reason many of today's dance/pop songs get too
  caught up in the production and lack any real substance... A good
  example of a radio-friendly dance/pop song with a somewhat
  complicated chord structure is Acoustic Alchemy's "So Kylie" on
  their American/English album (the song sounds simple enough but
  if you really listen to what's going on, you'll notice subtle
  chord changes and a really nice progression). Now I'm not going
  to say "Hung Up" is a terrible song, because everyone has their
  own taste. But I'm sorry to say it just doesn't do anything for
  me..</Text>

  <Text category="book">I've been following the Alex Cross series from
  its beginning, and after reading Cat &amp;amp; Mouse, I'm
  wondering if Patterson has taken these characters as far as they
  can go... Given the fact that there are 7 or 8 more Cross books
  written subsequently to this one, I can only hope that the series
  gets better. My complains are similar to those of other
  reviewers: 1. I'm getting sick of the perfection of Alex Cross.
  The man's a saintly father, saintly grandson, saintly lover,
  saintly charity worker, and saintly detective. These traits
  hooked the reader and made Cross an intriguing character, but
  he's fast becoming too one-dimensional. 2. The Cross/Sampson
  relationship. As if we weren't sick enough of this already. Every
  few chapters, we're reminded of the man-crush Cross and Sampson
  have on each other. Sampson is so perfect in Cross's eyes that it
  becomes tiresome to hear about it every time Sampson enters a
  scene. 3. The Cross/Christine Johnson relationship moves WAY too
  fast. One moment Christine is still mourning the loss of her
  husband (who was viciously murdered 6 months prior in Jack
  &amp;amp; Jill) and freaks out over an innocent dinner date, and
  the next she and Cross are madly in love. No development
  whatsoever, no line from Point A to Point B. 4. I'm not sure
  Patterson could have written the dialogue between Cross and his
  children any more unrealistically. Aren't these 7- and 9-year-old
  children? He has more intelligent conversations with his kids
  than he does with Sampson or Kyle Craig. 5. The entire novel is a
  series of pseudo-climaxes which are ultimately resolved by plot
  twists that seemingly arrive from left field. The Soneji
  resolution was anti-climactic at best, and the Mr. Smith
  conclusion was unfulfilling</Text>
  <Text category="book">I was really looking forward to reading this
  book since I am both a brain researcher and a professional
  musician. First it was highly disorganized and rambled from
  subject to subject without any real framework. Much of what the
  author spoke of was not related to how the brain processes music
  but speaks to the way research is conducted. Even this was sparse
  at best. He attempted to explain the elements of music so that
  the majority of people could understand it. However it became too
  watered down and even lost me. Lastly the author was entirely too
  self congradulatory as to his own accomplishments. Pushing the
  envelope of science should be award enough. For these reasons I
  can not recommend this book</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">It is obvious that this movie is full of lies.
  Although I have not actually seen it, I know this to be true
  because I have seen many discussions on the movie on the Fox news
  channel (God bless them!). The way he attacks poor Mr. Heston is
  deplorable. Can't Michael Moore tell from the comments Charlton
  made at the rallies that he doesn't have his faculties about him?
  I am also unsure that Mr. Heston even said the things that the
  movie shows him saying. The ability of Hollywood to manipulate
  and edit sound is truly amazing, making it appear that My
  President (Heston) is an uncaring, babbling idiot by simply using
  his own words - shame on you Michael! And as for the way he got
  the gun from the bank, I agree with the other posters that the
  entire point of a bank giving away free guns is completely
  nullified by the fact that they didn't give him the gun the
  minute he walked into the bank. Bravo to those who figured that
  out. Also, Michael Moore is fat. Take that Pinkie</Text>

  <Text category="music">After breaking the collective hearts of the
  soft rock-loving populace by leaving the powerhouse group
  Chicago, Traitor Cetera made a half-baked attempt to reconcile
  himself with his fanbase by recording this stinker. It's
  coincidental that the first track is titled "Big Mistake", as if
  Traitor knew his leaving one of the premier groups of our time
  was the worst decision he would ever make. I bought this album
  way back in 1986 with some birthday money, and after I had
  listened to the album once, I made myself go and apologize to all
  of my family members for wasting their money so foolishly. What
  else is here? Oh, you have the "Karate Kid II" ballad "Glory of
  Love", a tune so nauseating it's made me completely ignore the
  second film in the canon, and go straight from the original
  "Karate Kid" to "III" and "Next" whenever I do my yearly film
  marathon. I just pretend the second film never existed. It also
  has the semi-smash "Next Time I Fall", where Traitor makes it a
  point to hog the spotlight completely from guest vocalist Amy
  Grant. In short, if you a) thought Cetera's leaving Chicago was a
  great decision, or b) like your music pointless and nauseating,
  by all means get this album. If you want music with real heart
  and soul, just go buy some Chicago. You'll be glad you did</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">With a good script and a director better
  suited to the material (I've read Pedro Almodovar expressed
  interest in adapting the novel and Jonathan Demme was originally
  attached to direct), Asylum could have been a superb exploration
  of romantic obsession and a great showcase for star Natasha
  Richardson. Unfortunately, the film poorly tries to condense too
  much plot and things happen so fast that the film fails to fully
  explore the psychology of its characters in cinematic terms... a
  pretty major flaw for a movie that is supposed to be an
  exploration of the psychological effects of sexual obsession. The
  basic plot concerns the affair between the bored psychiatrist's
  wife (an excellent Natasha Richardson) and one of the asylum's
  patients (an equally good Marton Csokas), under the watchful eye
  of the patient's doctor (Ian McKellen). There are several plot
  twists in the last part of the movie, some of which seem quite
  preposterous, at least in the way the movie was shot. The only
  reason to watch this movie is to see Natasha Richardson. She does
  her best in spite of the choppy script, and she even won a Best
  Actress award in London for this film. However, as a
  psychological thriller or an exploration of sexual repression and
  obsession, director David Mackenzie has done an extremely sloppy
  job. (In fact, I remember that in the promotional interviews
  Richardson, credited as an executive producer, sounded very
  disappointed about the way the movie turned out.</Text>

  <Text category="music">Atleast they are trying this time around.
  Still no where near as good as the band was with Max. Pros:
  Faster and more back to their roots than the other releases
  without Max at the helm. Guitar playing is passable. Cons: Lack
  of solos. Derrick is still lacking as a vocalist. Just isn't as
  good as old Sepultura, songs lack hooks and are mostly
  forgetable. Bottom Line: This album falls short of expectations.
  The current Sepultura is nothing more than a very average metal
  band at best. If you like old Sepultura I suggest you not waste
  your money on this, but then again you might like it. Buyer
  beware</Text>

  <Text category="book">John Updike's literary criticism is perceptive
  and sparely written - every one of his non-fiction collections is
  worth reading. But his novels have, from the very first, been
  precious, over-written and stifling in their desperate need for
  approbation. When he writes fiction, he's like a dog doing tricks
  for reward. And certainly, the rewards have come. But for readers
  outside the US at least, it's all a little mystifying. John
  Cheever was a far better writer, yet his work seems somehow to be
  regarded by Americans as the lesser canon. Time will correct this
  mistake, no doubt, but in the meantime Updike pours out ever more
  cloying and over-heated work like this. If I still have your
  attention, let me recommend the 'Collected Stories' of John
  Cheever. Updike could only dream of writing prose like
  that.</Text>

  <Text category="music">Do you know why this double CD is often in the

  some very odd reason, the compiler at the record company decided
  to put 13 live songs instead of the studio versions that we all
  remember. For all we know, it may have been a copyright problem.
  I bought this for my Dad about 5 years ago, but we were both
  unaware of the live recordings until we played it. The live
  recordings on this CD are dismal and not related to the awesome
  "Hot August Night". Fortunately for me, I own the right Neil
  Diamond CD's which contain the studio versions. These are still
  available . The first is called "12 Greatest Hits" (A black and

  Hits Volume 2" (a colour photo of Neil sitting on a sofa). Both
  of these contain all the studio versions - and not one live

  Neil Diamond GOLD, as part of the GOLD series but I do not know

  <Text category="book">This book is poorly written and even more
  poorly edited. The back cover states ... "every subject is given

  Page 6: "So what formats can a script be saved as? There are
  three main kinds of script files: regular compiled script, which
  is the native AppleScript file format, and scripts saved as plain
  text or as applications. On top of that, OS X added a new option
  for saving compiled scripts and script applications called
  "bundle." Bundles are folders that appear and behave as files.
  You can read about them in Chapter 23." - I guess bundle is not a
  "main" format? Why is there a distinction between main formats
  and, for lack of a better term, minor formats? I have no idea.

  <Text category="health">This review covers the FB11NR: same unit with
  slightly different control pushbuttons and with an IR remote.
  Somehow, i had deluded myself into thinking that the spinning
  massagers under each foot were powered. Nope... basically just
  built-in plastic versions of those usually wooden massaging
  rollers that one rolls one's foot upon. That's fine, yet when i
  want to relax, i'm not thinking about moving my feet.
  Fortunately, those are removable, and removal is exactly what
  happened. The killer was that the center massage wheel, which IS
  supposed to be powered and IS supposed to spin, was D.O.A. This
  unit went back to the store, and we bought an FB21 instead.
  Amazon has no listing for that model, so i can't give a full
  review on it. It was good enough to keep. Both the FB11NR and the
  FB21 share some traits. Neither one really keeps water anywhere
  near its original temperature. Sound levels vary from fairly
  quiet to quite loud, depending upon the operating mode chosen (i
  did dB measurements on the FB21, but since Amazon doesn't list
  that one, you don't get to see them). The FB21 seems to have
  slightly better build quality, and everything worked out of the

  <Text category="music">...when you're gearing up for suicide. This
  whole album sounds like the last thoughts and comments of a
  person who's going to just end it all. I found myself suffering
  nightmares, fatigue, misery and paranoia. My ears unclogged but I
  started getting headaches and a fuzzy feel in my head. This is
  not a good album for the stressed, because it will just make you
  feel worse. I find this album unlikable and mostly unenjoyable.
  When I first listened to it it sounded inaccessable, after
  listening to it more and more I started to get more "into" it,
  but I can't say I found it a good place to be in. It's a somewhat
  interesting album, but it mostly just dragged me down, made me
  nervous, numb and hurt my head. People say this is great music.
  Let them say what they want. Give me some old fashioned enjoyable
  music that doesn't make a pest of itself. Kid A is just ok to me,
  and hasn't been worth all the effort to "get into". This almost
  seems like a sadomasochistic album to spank the listeners. I
  don't know, maybe I'm missing something, but to hear some "weird"
  music like this that has miles more heart and is alot kinder to
  the ears, try "Passengers" by U2. And Thom York sings like a
  Muppet on this album. By the way I've enjoyed Radiohead's first

  <Text category="music">I loved '' careless love`` and saw Madeleine
  live here in Rio de Janeiro in a reasonably good show.I am quite
  disappointed with this album however because I had great
  expectations.Let's face it folks, however smoky and billiesque
  her voice is she is never going to have the power and the range
  of the original.She needs to be really close miked and well
  recorded to get that voice to sound right.This is obvious from
  seeing her live. So what were those marketing executives thinking
  by promoting a cd full of soft and slow ballad covers that are
  obviously going to turn a huge spotlight on her vocal delivery?
  Those songs need an Ella,a Sarah Vaughn,or even a Shirley Horn
  -to name some giants- to have a chance of pulling it off with
  their huge range, timing and phrasing. To compound the problem ,
  the recording engineers/producers did not do a great job on her
  voice or the rest of the band for that matter.Everything is much
  too soft and distant (unlike careless love).If you want an
  atmospheric but still powerful sound you must produce something
  like the last Shirley Horn cds. Last but not least the rest of
  the good band are not allowed to play anything remotely
  interesting but are relegated to very minimalist backing chores.
  I think there is a misconception with the record excecs that M.P.
  has the qualities to make her a modern pop-jazz diva ala Diana
  Krall.She has to find her real voice and the correct material to
  match.Good luck.</Text>

  <Text category="health">Bayer is a name-brand aspirin. Any brand-name
  drug will cost at least double of that of the equivalent generic
  aspirin. I give this a one-star rating not because it is a poor
  product, rather, because it is so expensive. The dosage is 81 mg,
  taken to thin the blood to prevent heart attacks and strokes
  (generally taken by older individuals who perhaps have
  arteriosclerosis, have had a heart attack or stroke). Aspirin is
  a wonder-drug, the very first analgesic/anti-inflammatory
  medication to hit the market over 100 years ago. It is for mild
  to moderate pain and treats many different conditions such as
  arthritis, bone inflammation, joint pain, and even reduces fever.
  Aspirin causes blood platelets to not adhere to each other, thus
  it "thins" the blood and prevents blood clots from forming.
  Aspirin is thus used in emergency treatment of heart attacks and
  strokes. Some folks take a "baby" aspirin (81-160 mgs) each day
  to prevent blood clots from forming. Aspirin is actually
  acetyl-salicylic acid. Manufacturers alter the structure of
  aspirin slightly to grant it different properties in terms of its
  digestion, to make digestion easier. Some buffer it with antacids
  while others coat the tablet with a coating that prevents its
  digestion in the stomach (like Ecotrin). Regular aspirin, without
  any buffering or coatings is tolerated by most people, but some
  cannot take it without severe stomach upset. For these folks, the
  buffered form is a god-send. Unfortunately, Aspirin fell out of
  favor in the 60's and 70's when Reye's Syndrome developed in some
  children (under the age of 16) who took aspirin while they had
  the flu and/or chickenpox. About 30% of the children affected
  died and many more had permanent brain damage. Because of Reye's
  Syndrome, alternate analgesics were placed on the market, the
  premier being Tylenol. There is no reason to fear using aspirin
  if you are an adult, as Reye's Syndrome only occurred in children
  under 16 years of age. The usual dose of aspirin is 350 mg, with
  the "extra-strength form at 500 mg. Most adults will easily
  tolerate a dose of 650 mg (2 tablets) every 4 hours with a
  maximum daily dose of 5,200 mg. (Some with rheumatoid arthritis
  take up to 7200 mg/day with a doctor's supervision). There is no
  additional benefit to taking more than 1,000 mg every 4 hours.
  Increasing the dose beyond this point will only increase the
  toxicity of aspirin. Aspirin should be avoided in people taking
  blood-thinning medications, those with stomach ulcers, and used
  with caution in insulin-dependent diabetics. Allergies can
  develop to aspirin as well. Never mix aspirin with any of the
  non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, such as Ibuprofen, as there is
  no pain benefit and the gastric upset chance is greatly
  increased. Don't mix aspirin with alcohol either, as it is hard
  on the stomach. Used properly, aspirin is a terrific medication.
  I prefer to buy my aspirin in a generic form. One pays more for
  aspirin if it is produced by a name-brand manufacturer. However,
  the big-manufacturers also package aspirin in some of the
  buffered forms that some people tolerate better. Jim "Konedog"

  <Text category="book">I will not try to say that I asserted the
  painstaking, analytic effort that some would argue is necessary
  for an appreciation of Heidegger. More than that, I have no
  interest in doing so. It is largely agreed by the majority of his
  readers that this book deals with the question of being
  (existence), and my reading didn't lead me to any other
  conclusions. So as I said I have no interest in reading this a
  second time, further, deeper, or slower. Being and Time is chock
  full of invented terminology, to the extent that Michael Inwood
  was able to profit from his publication of A Heidegger
  Dictionary. Whatever you might think the word "world" means, for
  instance, is not what Heidegger means, and he will explain that
  to you throughout the duration of an agonizing 40 pages or so.
  This is the case with his entire vocabulary. If there was any
  need for all of the inventions and distinctions made by
  Heidegger, I would not bring this up as a crticism. Beyond the
  unventilated, severely sober, and utterly uninspiring character
  of Being in Time, I also call attention to the futility of it's
  project. If Heidegger was right about the historical neglect
  toward the question of being, perhaps more than 2000 years of
  historical peoples have been aware of something that eluded him:
  that there is no question of being. Why is "the question of
  being" so problematic? Because it is unanswerable, maybe. Or if
  it is answerable, we're not in any position to answer it. "Being"
  implies some kind of unvarying stability that just doesn't make
  sense. And if you posit an idea that is so concrete, so constant,
  you can't just bend it to make it fit reality. You've already
  betrayed your questioning. Truth, including the truth of being,
  is a local phenomenon. Truth is not always and forever true -
  it's true when it's true. But Heidegger wanted an everlasting
  truth, a dogmatic anthropology. Worse than the general
  uselessness of his project, and the toxic dregs left in his wake,
  Heidegger is guilty of not even presenting his ideas in an
  intersting or thought-provoking way</Text>

  BEAUTIFUL song that was cut from the movie why? Also what about
  "Prayer for a Duck" and MANY others!!! This is by far the worst
  ladies and gentlemen and completely ruins the show created by
  Stephen Schwartz and the great Bob Fosse! Oh yeah, and Chita
  Rivera's "Spread a Little Sunshine" was pathetic, and the Players
  did not convince me that they were creepy and really wanted
  Pippin to do the "grand finale." I was in this show and it was
  the greatest show I've ever done, but this DVD is pathetic. Don't

  the vantage point a "hard industry." I personally believe that
  it's in our long term interests to maintain a strong
  manufacturing base because that's the foundation of real wealth,
  not legal services or newswires. So this book sounded like the
  perfect source of information to explain our current economic
  situation, give an assessment of how bad or how good it really
  is, and suggest ways to improve it. Oh, how very, very wrong I
  was . . . This book started off strong, . . . for about four
  pages. After that a litany of tortured logic, un-sourced
  assertions, facts taken completely out of context except for the
  author's subjectively added adjectives, Orwellian double-speak,
  sleight of hand arguments, flat out ridiculuos statements,
  contradictory assessments, and even emotional vitriol coalesced
  not so much into an argument for industry but one for eighteenth
  century mercantilism with perhaps a sprinkling of far left George
  Soros on top to serve as an update for the twenty first century.
  Even a broken watch is correct twice a day though, so there were
  some good points in the book which buy it the 2 star rating.
  These include: - Manufacturing provides a large source of
  proprietary knowledge which both improves productivity and serves
  as a barrier of entry, creating an industry with a large base of
  high paying jobs, provided it's run right. (A big if.) - High
  wage nations can still compete effectively with low wage nations
  in manufacturing by being capital intensive. - Americans need to
  save more and our education system needs to produce more
  engineers and technically oriented graduates. - There is some
  excess in the financial services and managers of publicly traded
  companies take too short term a view, leading them to sell the
  company upriver in the long run because of a personal temporary
  short term gain. (i.e. Enron) A scholarly, fair, and
  comprehensive book that focused on the above would be extremely
  interesting and useful. This is not what you'll get in this book
  though. Instead you'll get: A begining section about
  postindustrialism, things like the internet, information
  technology, financial services, etc., the things that make the
  services based economy. In three chapters the author simply sets
  up straw men by taking the worst examples of post industrial
  advocates, instead of presenting a comprehensive picture of the
  post industrial argument. Not being satisfied with this he
  proceeds to beat the straw men, set them on fire, and piss on the
  smoldering remains. This is where vitriol even comes out, where
  he equates the post-industrialists to people incapable of even
  thinking. If someone has to go to this extreme to make their
  argument, they probably don't have one. Most telling he leaves
  the final assessment of the value of the internet to a feminist.
  To me, this would be like leaving the final assessment of how
  good a bicycle is to, oh, I don't know, let's say a fish. A
  middle section extolls the virtues of manufacturing. This is a
  bunch of hand picked anectdotal stories and there's no overview
  of manufacturing in the world or its real impact on economies at
  large. This is the kind of subject that screams for reams of
  data, charts of GDP growth over time, pie charts of the breakdown
  of economies into services, manufacture, agriculture, etc. You
  will get none of that. There's little value except in reassuring
  the obvious, high wage nations CAN do manufacturing. Many of
  these cherry-picked anectdotal examples still don't quite
  dove-tail with all his claims about manufacturing though! You
  also know you're being left in the dark with a plethora of CYA
  disclaimer statments like "while Industry_X has certainly had its
  share of problems recently . . ." at the begining of a section. A
  final section basically amounts to an attack on laissez-faire,
  free markets, and the concept of free trade. George Soros and a
  bunch of other lefties, with Pat Buchanan thrown in for
  "balance", should be listened to instead. The worst part of this
  book is the author's lack of an ability to make any sort of
  coherent argument. Examples of twisted thinking abound: - A
  post-industrial "industry" grows five times over in a certain
  period. The author then goes onto explain how this is not really
  real growth but something that in reality is bad. Later he proves
  how great a manufacturing industry is because in the same period
  it grows a whopping 60%! Self contradictory evaluations of the
  performance of services vs manufacturing is common and always
  falls down on the side that the manufacturing industry is far far
  better than the service industry even when all the standard
  economic indicators suggest otherwise. The author's challenge to
  the reader seems to be "who are you going to believe? Me, or your
  lying eyes?" - He rips into American post industrial industries
  as being labor intensive and vulnerable to low wage nations
  because Americans are no smarter or more creative or more
  anything than laborers around the world. Later he talks about how
  great German manufacturing is because Germans are so much more
  diligent than the rest of the world's workers. - The only facts
  he presents - and they are surprisingly thin and overwhelmed by
  mere assertions - are always modified by his subjective opinion
  and never put in context. When describing service industries
  "paltry" $50 million revenues, "only" 60,000 jobs,
  "disappointing" 24% of revenues from foreign sources is common.
  But when describing manufacturing "a very high" $6 million
  revenues, "a good mix" of 1,500 jobs, and similar glowing
  assessments are inevitable despite the number to follow. A number
  in and of itself means nothing. The fact the author leaves out
  any head on, direct comparison between industries is telling. -
  Official figures are the ultimate source of information when they
  agree with what the author believes. When the official figures
  don't agree with him, he finds some loner who does and then
  barely explains how this time around the official figures are
  somehow wrong. When attacking his straw men though, he accuses
  them of ignoring official figures and quoting some loner. - Gems
  of Orwellian double-speak sentences include examples like "Solar
  is already a fully competitive source of energy in remote areas
  that do not have grid electricity. (pg. 184)" I.e. it's
  competitive where there is NO competition! And "Even in
  Singapore, one of the freest societies in the East, the savings
  rate was successfully boosted by a system of forced savings . . .
  (pg. 229)" That's not very free if it's FORCED is it? (His
  defense of solar is one of the most hilariously pathetic eight
  pages I've ever read and really is worth the price of the book.
  He capstones it with the "most encouraging" observation that
  solar cells have gone from producing one third of the energy used
  to make them before they wore out - that is consuming more total
  energy in their manufacture than they eventually make!- to now
  producing three times as much energy as required to produce them
  before they wear out. Wow, what an achievement. Any ACTUAL power
  source converts many thousands of times the energy used to
  manufacture it before it's internal workings wear out, but
  whatever . . .) - Americans are dumb and the only successful
  American companies basically blundered into monopolies on
  standards. The American economy, despite the statistics, is in
  bad shape. The Japanese instead are eight feet tall, can read
  people's minds and see through lead. The Japanese economy,
  despite the statistics, is in really great shape. This type of
  persistently biased characterization makes you question
  everything he claims, and eliminates any value or truth he might
  actually have in his arguments. The author basically can't get
  out of his own way. - He always attacks opponents of his
  viewpoint by claiming that they don't put numbers into context,
  are using twisted logic, making mere assertions instead of
  quoting facts, etc., apparently oblivious that these are the very
  same tactics he himself uses! - He claims Boeing is no longer a
  good company because 30% of components in a Boeing aircraft are
  now made abroad vs. 2% in the 1960's. This is actually because
  foreign manufacturing for those components happens to be better
  and cheaper. America isn't doing that badly in aerospace by the
  way. The author fails to mention that 50% of the "European"
  Airbus is made in America. This is an example of free trade
  actually distributing production to where it is most efficient.
  The list goes on and on to ridiculous proportions. You'd have to
  buy the book to see them all because there's at least one thing
  an alert and critical reader can find highly questionable on each
  page. All in all, this book was way off the mark and a highly
  squandered opportunity. It's really a mercantilist argument, and
  the only common thread that I could see in all the author's
  cloudy reasoning is that nation's should do everything in their
  power to export more than they import no matter what. It's NOT,
  unfortunately, a book about how to revitalize American
  manufacturing in a globalized world.</Text>

  <Text category="health">I found these diapers while searching for the
  7th generation brand diapers. I was impressed and eager to try
  Tushies because there was no chlorine and no gell used to produce
  them, I ordered the medium size for my 20lb baby. The diapers
  came sooner then expected, which was great. My single star rating
  comes from my experience using them. They have no elastic and
  they are stiff which makes it hard to get a super snug fit. It
  seems like no matter how tight I can get the diapers my son leaks
  through them, out the sides and up the belly. Because the
  moisture does not wick away from his skin he also developed a
  diaper rash- his first and we have been only using these diapers
  for a week</Text>

  <Text category="music">Bad news is that I wasted my time listening to

  <Text category="music">I only bought this one for the song by Jerry
  Orbach. The first 2 DVDs were better</Text>
  <Text category="music">I first became a fan of the Gorillaz with
  their excellent 2nd CD, Demon Days. The interesting thing about
  this band is that their music is so strange and so "out there"
  that when you first hear one of their CD's...it sounds like
  complete garbage. But once you listen again and again, you start
  to like it more and more. Eventually you end up really liking the
  CD. That was the case with Demon Days. After enjoying that CD
  fully, I thought I should check out the first Gorillaz CD, and I
  didn't like it all that much. There just seems to be very little
  actual songs on the CD. Way too much of it sounds like complete
  filler. There were a couple throwaway songs on Demon Days, but
  most of the stuff on that CD was great. Here, we've got songs
  that are just...boring. Nothing happens. I was waiting for the
  melody or a cool tune to occur in some of these songs, but it
  never happens. You just listen to 2-D whining into the microphone
  with dull beats in the background. (Such as on songs like New
  Genious, Man Research, and Starshine.) Some songs are nothing but
  beats with no lyrics at all, sometimes sounding just like static
  noise. Songs like this, such as Double Bass, are cool for a
  minute or two, but the song drags on for practically 5 minutes.
  It gets boring. Other songs, like 5/4, M1 A1, and Rock the House
  are catchy at first, but just don't have staying power. They get
  old. 5/4 got annoying quickly, M1 A1 and Punk lost their appeal
  quickly, and Rock the House is another song that would have been
  better if they cut about 2 minutes out of it. And songs like
  Latin Simone are just annoying. The remixes of 19-2000 and Clint
  Eastwood that end the CD are also fairly forgettable, although
  19-2000's kind of catchy on the first couple listens. There are
  some good songs here, though. Tomorrow Comes Today, Clint
  Eastwood, Gravity, 19-2000, and Left Hand Suzuki Method are cool
  songs. Slow Country's kind of cool, too. And Dracula's got an
  awesome, almost haunting sound to it, and it's really absorbing.
  Although it too, unfortuantely, loses its tune and turns to
  repetitive and aimless techno noise about half way through it.
  This small collection of good songs, though, is surrounded by a
  huge collection of filler tracks. Much of this CD just isn't
  really that good. I don't know...this CD just seemed empty. Very
  few meaningful tracks, lots of filler, and some really annoying
  and repetitive songs. Some good songs were stretched to almost
  5-minutes long, mostly given filler techno beats that ruin the
  songs. Clocking in at 72 minutes, (which makes it 22
  minutes(!)longer than Demon Days) this CD was loaded with filler
  and just not enough good stuff. People interested in The Gorillaz
  should pick up their superior follow-up, Demon Days, instead of
  this one. If I listened to this debut CD first, I probably
  wouldn't have ended up liking this band very much. The good news
  about this is that the Gorillaz have not hit a sophmore slump;
  their CDs are getting better, not worse. That is a great sign for
  the future of this awesome band.</Text>
  <Text category="health">Molly, daughter or Richard- I usually write
  positive reviews on this site but not this time. Why on earth do
  dermatologists recommend this s***? Last year my hormones were
  all out of wack and I had a period for a whole month. I broke out
  severely as one would expect. Dermatologists (including mine)
  swear by this aweful chetaphil. I HATE IT! It wasnt strong enough
  for my skin. It made my acne even worse if you can imagine! I'd
  been using it for four months when I finally decided enough was
  enough and I started using Neutrogena Frangrance Free Facial
  Cleanser. That change made all the difference in the world! I
  still do have acne but now it is mild acne instead of severe
  acne. Now its mostly just old, light scarring and the occasional
  breakouts around my chin and lips the week before my period. One
  of my friends is a dietition and she also has used Cetaphil and
  didnt like it at all. Please do not buy Cetaphil even if your
  dermatologist recommends it. You will totally regret it</Text>

  keep it from toppling over. The sides have no stabilization

  <Text category="dvd">Saw "Hart's War" the other night and couldn't
  really believe anyone would invest money and time in a film as
  awful as this one. This film bombed at the box office and was
  yanked from circulation after only a few days. Here are ten
  reasons why: 1. This film isn't "The Great Escape" and even
  though he would probably like to think otherwise, Bruce Willis
  isn't Steve McQueen. Even though Willis received top billing,
  this is a Colin Farrell vehicle. 2. The vast majority of the
  target audience of 18-34 year old moviegoing males could care
  less about what happened during the Reagan administration, much
  less World War II. "Hart's War" may just as well be a film about
  a POW camp during the War of 1812. Anything with Vin Diesel or
  the Rock would be bound to sell more tickets. 3. As far as
  depicting life in a POW camp, "Hart's War" is pretty much on par
  with "Hogan's Heroes". The Germans are nice guys with guns who
  don't know very much and everyone gets away with just about
  anything. Where did the GI's get all those cigarettes, anyway? 4.
  Any Stalag Luft comandant worth his weight in sauerkraut would
  have just as soon killed the Bruce Willis character as look at
  him. As depicted in "Hart's War", the camp commandant (as
  portrayed by Marcel Lures) would have had a very difficult time
  maintaining any sort of status as an officer in the German Army.
  His collection of American jazz/blues records is a cute writer's
  invention that has nothing to do with the reality of the
  situation, or of the type of men who were in charge of German POW
  camps. In reality, the Marcel Lures character would probably have
  been relegated to another type of nazi camp with a pink triangle
  sewn on the front of his tunic. 5. The storyline is not
  completely unbelievable - trials did take place in POW camps, one
  good example being the POW's who were tried and hung in
  Andersonville; However, the whole idea that the camp's commandant
  would actively participate in such a trial as sort of a Jerry
  Springer type advocate is ludicrous. 6. The idea that during the
  trial, a group of POW's who escape go on a secret mission to
  destroy a nearby munitions factory is insulting. Not only did
  nothing like this ever happen during World War II, it degrades
  the bravery of those poor souls whose only act of heroism was to
  survive internment under harsh and sometimes brutal conditions.
  The German army simply wasn't that stupid. 7. I saw this film
  once and didn't like it. I thought that maybe the second time
  would be better. It wasn't. 8. Beyond being sheer Hollywood
  political correctness, "Hart's War" seriously misrepresents many
  of the more important aspects of internment. It ignores the real
  focus of life in such a Stalag which, for most POW's, was just
  day to day survival. Also, the soldiers who served in our armed
  forces during World War II and also happened to be African
  Americans weren't spineless, hapless dopes. 9. Bruce Willis
  playing the same role in variations of "Die Hard" over and over
  and over again is tiring. 10. Better films about the same sort of
  subject matter are "The Tuskeegee Airmen" and "Stalag 17".
  Hopefully in a few years, "Hart's War" will be completely
  forgotten, and these dvd's will be rotting in some
  landfill.</Text>

  <Text category="music">At no point in my following review am I by any
  means intentionally downing Hank Jr. I am just trying to give an
  honest review of this cd. At the time this album was realeased,
  Hank Jr. was riding high, winning big at the CMA's and ACM's. He
  was also releasing some of the most critically aclaimed country
  records of his recording career. But then for some reason he
  decided he needed to record some rock and roll. To me this cd is
  a studio recorded version of a Hank Williams Jr. live concert.
  The only difference is he didn't botch the vocals as he does on
  his live show. The music is decidedly 80% not country, it drifts
  towards eighties rock. If you trace Hank Jr.'s recording career,
  you can point at this cd at the one that started the downward
  spiral that he has only began to pull himself out of. I must say
  though, this cd contains one of Hanks last top 10 hits, "If the
  South Woulda Won," which is an hard to find recording on his
  compilations. I'd say this cd is kinda essential collecion wise,
  just because of that song.</Text>
  <Text category="music">This CD Is garbage. Juvenile should go hang

  Welcome Back by Mase. That is a good comeback album. The only
  thing that makes the album even worth noting is the beats of
  Mannie Fresh. Juvenile just was a waste of those excellent beats.

  <Text category="dvd">Interestingly, this pro-apartheid film was
  produced and written by Jack Abramoff, now famous for pleading
  guilty to fraud and tax evasion in the course of orchestating the
  biggest American congressional corruption scandal in a
  generation. Yes the same man who bribed over 60 congressmen and
  senators, robbed several native american tribes blind, tried to
  take out life insurance policies on tribal elders with himself as
  the beneficiary, and called the Choctaw tribal council "Monkeys"
  and "troglodytes", had an interesting earlier career. He was
  disqualified from the student government election in his Beverly
  Hills elementary school for exceeding spending limits. He took
  over the young republican movement in college with his
  schoolmates including Ralph Reed of the Christian Coalition, and
  longtime republican insider Grover Norquist. But more relevant to
  this movie, well into the 1990's while actively working in the
  Hollywood film industry he worked both covertly and overtly to
  support the racist whites only Apartheid Goverment of the old
  South Africa, and to oppose and discredit Nelson Mandela and the
  ANC's struggle for majority rule and racial equality. During this
  period, he conceived this piece of bizarre propoganda, paid for
  by the Apartheid government in the old South Africa, equating the
  struggle for black liberation in South Africa with communism and
  the Soviet Union, and openly placing his sympathies with the
  racist minority Afrikkaner government. The hero of the film is
  based on the many mercenaries, or so called soldiers of fortune,
  as they are called in their trade magazine which like the makers
  of this film, were also enthusiastic about private killers being
  hired to murder activists fighting against apartheid. An amazing
  historical anomoly, this piece has even more significance in the
  wake of the currently unfolding scandal which promises to be one
  of the largest in history, involving bribery,favors, protection
  of sweatshops (in US colonies where women are forced into having
  abortions), fraud, the chritian coalition, pitting one tribe
  against another to essentially steal money from native america,
  and possibly the gangland style murder of his former business
  partner, the owner of Sun Cruises, when he complained about being
  defrauded in the sale of his cruise line. My advice, buy it used

  enough money off the backs of the American people. Let's not
  forget how fear of communism was used to justify murder, racial
  segregation, perversion of the constitution, police state style
  abuses of civil rights, and many other crimes against humanity.
  Let's learn the lessons of history and preserve what is good
  about the USA. Let this movie be a record of the power of
  Hollywood to either perpetuate lies that are used to kill and
  abuse people, or to turn away from evil and tell the truth. Let's

  <Text category="dvd">With The Straight Story, Lynch demonstrated
  none of the recognizable trademarks that transformed him into the
  director that I love. This film felt like a "blind date" gone
  bad. The Straight Story showed up, David Lynch arrived, but the
  rest of the date felt muddled, confusing, and utterly disastrous.
  Everything in this film seemed wrong. Lynch's choice for lead
  actor, the bland Sissy Spacek, the filler of repeat cornfield
  montages, all the way to the incoherent time spent on the read, I
  just felt that nobody had control over this picture, yet the
  randomness (and the possible tear ending) gave critics something
  to smile about. This is not a David Lynch film, and for those
  walking into this with images of Mulholland Drive, Twin Peaks, or
  even Eraserhead in their mind will be utterly discombobulated.
  The Straight Story attempted to show us a slice of Americana via
  the cornfields of Iowa, but for this boy based in the Flatlands
  of Illinois, it just seemed repetitive and boring. What initially
  pulled me away from this film was the technique that Lynch used
  to introduce us to Alvin and his daughter Rose. Alvin lying on
  the ground because he can't get up, the clichï¿½
  use of taking him to the doctor letting us know that he is
  deteriorating, while bringing us the central conflict of his
  brother falling ill was just too much in such a little time
  frame. Spacek's depiction of Rose seemed unbalanced and rather
  stale. She brought nothing fresh to this rather emotional
  character outside of a stutter and some unfunny scenes. I
  expected so much more from Spacek with her timeline of cinema,
  but this felt like something she did on an afternoon instead of
  providing us with the intensity that she harbors. Then, to add
  more fuel to the fire, there was Richard Farnsworth. Again, he
  isn't a horrible actor, but it felt like Lynch picked him because
  he fit the role physically, but alas, couldn't master it
  mentally. Farnsworth seemed out in left field for a majority of
  his time onscreen. I couldn't tell if he was trying to remember
  his lines or if he was truly in character. His eyes seemed watery
  for everything which brought too much emotion to those little
  scenes, and seemed to bring not enough by the dramatic ending.
  His entire speech about his time overseas at war was pathetic,
  while some will quote it as being his speech of a lifetime, I saw
  it as babble (and no, I am not that insensitive - I just felt it
  could have been handled by a stronger, more professional actor).
  The rest of the cast seemed equally as unimportant. I wanted
  Lynch to either go 100% for this film or none at all, but alas,
  it felt as if he just half-ed his way through this heap. Speaking
  of David Lynch, where did he go in this film? There were some
  scenes that I witnessed that screamed the director that I love,
  but then there were others that just felt like he took pointers
  from Ken Burns' "Looking at America" class. I hated the sweeping
  cornfields that seem to plague this film. Instead of keeping us
  by Alvin's side throughout his journey, Lynch gave us a
  repetitive view of farming and corn. There is nothing wrong with
  this technique when making the epic that one desperately needs to
  see once in a while, but when the same images were used over and
  over again, I nearly felt Lynch was humoring us with the dulls of
  Iowa instead of being the majestic all the critics raved about. I
  think he could have been stronger with his filler than what he
  was with this film. He needed something to couple with the
  authenticity of Alvin, but the stock-footage that he chose to
  show was definitely not the balance one could hope for. I also
  felt there was more to be discussed with the friends that he met
  along the way. Alvin was a walking storybook, filled with the way
  that he led his own life instead of listening to those around him
  and learning from their experiences as well. Lynch made Alvin
  very closed minded, which did not create a strong protagonist for
  the feature. Alvin was a strong character, but I needed more with
  this story. I wanted him to make choices, learn new things, and
  bring that to his brother's table when they eventually met. I
  felt cheated when this never occurred and felt as if Lynch was
  saying that this journey through Americana was that we could
  learn from Alvin, and not vice-versa. Overall, I wasn't stunned
  by this picture. I thought Lynch could have been stronger with
  his choice of direction and cast instead of what seemed like he
  just "played it safe". The overplayed stock footage of cornfields
  infuriated me due to the lack of time that we could have been
  spending with Alvin. Speaking of Alvin, why couldn't he have been
  a stronger, better-rounded character? I felt after watching this
  film that Lynch had duped me into believing that he wanted to
  paint a picture of America, but instead gave us nothing more than
  soft music, recycled images, and stock characters. The stories
  were interesting to listen to, but brought nothing fresh to the
  table. I must admit that the brotherly love moment brought a tear
  to my eye (since I have a brother as well), but why couldn't we
  focus on this further. Lynch made the riff between the two
  brothers seem like a toss in the pan, when it was the central
  focus of this film. The Straight Story could have been a strong
  tale bringing in a new image for Lynch, but instead it felt
  jagged and old. I could suggest one viewing for this film, any
  further, and you will see how dull those cornfields really claim
  to be! Grade: ** out of ****</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">I really wanted to give Superman Volume 3 a
  full 5 stars, but unfortunately the quality control of the DVD
  release is poor, hence the 1 star rating. The DVD set I purchased
  skipped at the Green Lantern episode. The replacement I got also
  skipped at the same place. In addition, the two-sided disc format
  with which all three DVD volumes have been released is a damage
  prone format. Luckily I was able to get a full refund, but at
  this point I'm not sure if or when I'll try my chance at buying
  this set again. The lack of quality control is too bad, because
  Volume 3 contains some of the best episodes of the whole series.
  If you are fortunate enough to get a DVD set free of defects,
  then you are really in for a treat. Bruce Timm and company bring
  the same high level of storytelling to Superman as they did on
  Batman: The Animated Series. Of particular note is an ongoing
  subplot involving the villain Darkseid throughout the series. It
  finally gets put front and center in several episodes of Volume
  3, and leads straight to the very powerful and dramatic series
  finale. I felt that the finale could have been written out across
  three episodes instead of two due to the scale of the story, but
  nevertheless it is a great ending for a great series</Text>

  She states that, &amp;amp;quot;Doctors touch patients, not vice
  versa because doctors are more privileged and powerful than
  patients.&amp;amp;quot; Did she consider that doctors need to
  touch their patients in order to examine them - not because of

  <Text category="dvd">No intellectual can afford to be unacquainted
  with the immortal John Dewey and his "experimental school." Who
  would dare criticize the education legend inseparably linked with
  the irreproachable rhetoric of "progressivism?" I would. Dewey's
  conception of the child as learner assumes that the uneducated
  mind is essentially capable of directing its own knowledge by a
  spontaneous inquisitiveness stemming from nature study. This he
  then expects to blossom into a more expanded consideration of the
  various academic subjects with the teacher merely facilitating
  transitions and answering the child's self-posed questions. The
  problems in Dewey's model begin with his science
  fair-meets-museum-meets-playground-meets-lecture hall school
  design: the model is untested on any large scale and the cost
  plus upkeep is prohibitively expensive. Classes are small and
  require several specialists and non-reusable materials. As if
  kids didn't have enough problems with the basic skills set
  already, Dewey would have them heavily involved in shop and home
  economics. Even more outrageous in Dewey's model is the premise
  that we ought never force students to study what they do not
  like. Their own intellectual prejudices reign supreme and by
  implication, teachers are discouraged from evaluating against
  solid standards. Experienced teachers know that kids can easily
  hide their shortcomings even when required to study their weak
  subjects, and that remediation is hard to implement before they
  slip further behind. How could Dewey's recommendation to cater
  almost exclusively to the child's intrinsic likes NOT further
  disguise and exacerbate low performance? Deweyism of course, like
  many other off-the-wall theories of education, denies Behaviorism
  when it refuses to acknowledge psychological patterns in man. It
  depicts formulaic teaching and learning as fundamentally faulty
  and generalized curricula as harmful to student individuality.
  Nothing could less representative of the quality research
  conducted, particularly Project Follow Through: the great
  skeleton in the student-centered advocates' closet. I'd
  personally like to see Dewey's updated plan for seamlessly moving
  kids, who come into class with their "natural inquisitiveness"
  programmed by TV, rap music, and other pop media, into colonial
  American history, calculations of hyperbolic asymptotes,
  Tennessee Williams, and the "plus-que-parfait" tense. But of
  course, such leaps of interest are unnecessary if we utterly
  throw out the old-fashioned academic corpus along with the
  old-fashioned school system. 90% of students in high schools
  today report that they do NOT feel adequately challenged. Maybe
  the answer doesn't lie in yielding to children's lack of
  intellectual discipline but in tapping their potential to control
  that uninformed caprice. Dewey's "progressivism" relies upon the
  contradiction of allowing uneducated mind educate the teacher on
  its own education. From the absurdity of it, I can only conclude
  that sane people latch onto this school gedankenexperiment to
  maintain an escapist fantasy in light of dismally high drop-out
  rates, lowered standards, and social discord. But a radical
  solution is not necessarily synonymous with a good one</Text>

  succeeds, until a Navy hero wins the opportunity to spend
  Christmas with her in her house in Connecticut, enjoying her
  homemaking skills and meeting her baby. Problem is, she doesn't
  have any of those things. She borrows the house (from a man who
  wants to marry her), she borrows the cooking skills of a sweet
  grandfatherly chef who secretly cooks for her at the house, and
  she even borrows a baby. The unmaking beings when she tells the
  Navy man her child is a boy, and when he volunteers to give it a
  bath he discovers it's really a girl. Then the mother of the baby
  takes it back, and the baby is replaced by a baby who looks
  nothing like the first one. Then the woman is falling in love

  borrowed the house still believes she's going to marry him, and
  keeps bringing a minister to the house for a quickie wedding.

  <Text category="book">I was expecting this book to be a great story,
  but very disappointed. I cannot believe the publisher allowed the
  author to publish this book as it is. The book is insipid and
  dull, has no flow, no story, or no plot. Let me present an
  example. I have read many insightful Newsweek articles by a
  writer Allan Sloan. For example, Sloan describes a Sprint merger
  event in this way, "If talk is getting cheaper, why did MCI
  WorldCom pay $115 billion to buy Sprint? The once staid phone
  companies have launched a merger blitzkrieg in an effort to
  emerge at the center of the wired world. Can regulators handle
  the complex new order....." It has a clear logical axis, and has
  a force to attract readers into it. But Jeter describes it like
  this, "The merger announcement of WorldCom and Sprint spurred
  building activity around Worldcom headquarters as real estate
  developers readied for economic prosperity. The real estate
  inventory swelled with new planned unit....." It always presents
  off-center, trivial detail which makes a reader bored. 70% of
  books are consumed to described a dry and dull fact, like "the
  merger of company A &amp;amp; B raised the stock to $X" etc.
  There is no insight here. But unfortunately, unlike Enron
  scandal, there is no other book that centered on the Worldcom
  scandal. You would get much better comprehension by collecting
  articles in Newsweek or Business Week, if you have LexisNexis or

  <Text category="book">Once upon a time I was given a
  vanity-published book to review. It was an illogical mess, full
  of breathtaking non-sequiturs. While reading "Iron John," I
  couldn't help thinking of it. The vanity book, however, was at
  least entertaining. John Eldredge refers to "Iron John" liberally
  in his book "Wild at Heart," and because I considered that a
  ringing endorsement, I purchased a copy. I can't tell you what a
  chore it has been to finally finish reading it. The hardest part
  was not flinging it away in disgust about 17 times. It's one
  thing to write a rambling tome full of obscure references; it's
  another to publish it. That people can slog through it and call
  it "profound" and "important" is baffling; what's even more
  mind-boggling is that people claim that this book "spoke" to
  them. I think it's a case of "I'd better say I understand it, or
  people will think I'm not erudite." Well, let me be erudite about
  it: "Iron John" is a big, steaming pile of New Age crapola. Don't

  <Text category="dvd">"Con Express" has lots of action in it, which
  is great because this hides the poor writing and uninteresting
  characters. Unfortunately, the action isn't enough, and in
  between stunt pieces and shoot-outs, the audience is tempted to
  doze off. City Heat Productions isn't really known for producing
  films of the highest quality, so usually I go easy on them. If
  this were a big-budget company producing this, I'd be inclined to
  pan it entirely. But I wasn't expecting much and got a little
  more than I bargained for. The action is, for the most part,
  pretty good but nothing competitive with your usual dumb action
  movie. Flanery and Vosloo are perfectly casted, but everyone else
  seems to stiff to add any more flow to the movie. Vosloo
  especially appears to be enjoying himself as an over-the-top bad
  guy hijacking a train containing deadly chemicals. The film moves
  fast and contains shades of better movies like Under Siege 2, Con
  Air, Spy Game, and Speed. If you liked those, you probably won't
  mind this one too much. Just go easy on it</Text>

  <Text category="book">I have been slogging through this book for
  weeks now, it was a terrible shock to the system after John

  narrative thrust, often stopping and retreading events slightly
  out of chronological order and frequently bringing all forward
  motion to a halt by describing the intricacies of some
  bureaucratic office or another. The one consistent thing
  throughout this book is the author's obvious agenda to "set the

  I Can't Quit You Baby, Walter's Walk and Ozone Baby. It's a shame
  that Traveling Riverside Blues and Hey Hey, What Can I Do were

  it's the only place you can find Hey Hey, What Can I Do, one of
  my favorite Zeppelin songs, and with Riverside Blues, you have a
  choice: Shell out $100 to get it, or sit through the crappy BBC

  I do it on occasion if I feel like I need to slap my legs in to

  35 minute warm-up is mundane and uninspired. By the time I finish
  doing the same repetitions on the same leg for 15 minutes I
  hardly feel like doing the whole process again for the other leg.
  I also find the way the instructions are given and the background
  music to be extremely irritating. In order for me to get through
  the video I have to put on some different music and turn the TV
  down until I can just barely hear the instructor's voice to know
  I'm keeping up with the video. In my opinion this video is more
  of a test of patience than a real yoga workout experience.</Text>
  <Text category="music">Eight years ago today was the day Blondie's
  reunion album was released, and though it was great to see
  Blondie back together, No Exit just fell short on many levels.
  2004's The Curse of Blondie(see my review also on Amazon)is a
  much better album and should have been their comeback. No Exit
  won't exactly take you back to the hooks that made Blondie
  famous. Harry's lyrics are wonderful in "Double Take," but the
  deadpan melody literally kills the song. Fans were also not
  terribly waiting for jazz standards("Boom Boom in the Zoom Zoom
  Room") or revamped demo tracks("Out in the Streets"), but the
  worst cut is the title song that includes a rap verse by Coolio.
  Both the band and Coolio could have thought of something more
  productive to sing about. The music isn't catchy either. All is
  not lost with songs like "Night Wind Sent," and Harry's own
  transformation in "Forgive and Forget, plus who would dare argue
  Blondie's potential to shake the pop world again when you hear
  "Maria." As the album's best track, "Maria" is a wonderful
  reminder of how Blondie, and Debbie, can still create an
  infectious pop song that leaves a template on the mind</Text>

  <Text category="book">Noam Chomsky has thrived greatly in this great
  country of his, yours, and mine - the United States of America.
  He has made millions of dollars teaching, lecturing, selling his
  books, and investing. His world-wide fame in psycholinguistics is
  well-deserved. His infamy is merited for his lack of loyalty to
  his own Jewish ethnicity and the U.S., in spite of the fruits he
  has received by being a citizen of the United States. He has
  repaid this country in bile with his incredibly biased analysis
  of American foreign policy. He goes way beyond a balanced
  multiculturism, when he always ranks the U.S. and Israel as
  foremost among the terrorist forces in the world now, and even in
  history. His distrust of any authority, benign or otherwise, is
  reflected in his dogmatic and unexamined support of the
  "underdog," even if that underdog is a suicide bomber or a major
  terrorist organization such as Al Queda or Hezbollah. Yet since
  1955, hypocrite Chomsky has worked for the "overdog"
  Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which has actively and
  enthusiastically participated in the development of weapons of
  War and mass destruction, and continues to this very day. Chomsky
  trumps his own potential for gifted analytic objectivity with his
  simple hatred of the United States and the Jewish State. If he
  were not so attached to the freedom of making money, earning the
  adulation of the American Left, and freedom to express himself,
  he might be able to give more direct and personal support for our
  enemies and his friends by taking up residence in North Korea,
  Iran, or Syria. Let us hope he retires outside of our homeland
  that he hates so much, the United States of America. God Bless
  America, which will continue to give Chomsky the right to speak,
  teach, and make lots of money. Raybo</Text>
  <Text category="book">I must say I enjoyed the book, but the ending
  was so sudden, with so many things left hanging, that I was
  disappointed. I wish one more chapter had been written to clear
  up- how did Manderly catch fire, what did they do when they got
  to the burning house, and how did they pick up their lives. All
  we had at the ending was ashes. Also, the narrator, who never
  gives her name, was sometimes very odd- hiding behind doors in
  her own home, sneaking food, hiding behind chairs. The book is
  worth reading, but I wish that, instead of spending so much time
  describing the trees and the sea, Du Maurier had written a better
  ending.</Text>
  <Text category="music">I purchased this disk along with others to

  brightness and crispness on this specific disk. In fact, the demo
  disk for my TL has the Marvin Gaye song "Let's Get It On" and it
  is remarkably brighter on that disk than on this collection. If
  you are looking for DVD-A disks with 5.1 surround...I'd pass on

  <Text category="music">I am a huge fan of Elvis Costello and ran to
  the shop as soon as I read the great reviews of this album, what
  a mistake!!! Very few of the arrangements offer an improvement
  over the original version. The cardboard cut salsa montuno of
  'Clubland' sounds as classy and natural as a plastic flamingo and
  the wonderful Ska sound of 'Watching the Detectives' is lost in a
  jazz arrangement that doesn't offer much to the melody. Elvis'
  voice is not suited the long sustained notes of 'Almost Blue' and
  most of the songs. It worked well on his 'Juliet Letters' album
  because the Brodsky Quartet played for his style but with the
  clean and crisp sound of the Metropole Orkest it is just painful.

  <Text category="book">Now, I enjoy Victorian adventure fiction as
  much as the next person -- in fact, probably more than the next
  person, since the average "next person" hasn't ever read any.
  Tales of derring-do, adventures to unexplored distant lands, lost
  civilizations, great artifacts, etc. -- that's all good stuff.
  What's not good is this book, which is tedious in the extreme. On
  the surface of it, Haggard's followup to his hugely successful
  (and infinitely better) "King Solomon's Mines" has all the
  elements: a dynamic duo of scholar-adventurers (one of whom is
  descended from pharaohs!), a mysterious message from the past
  delivered by a dying man, an expedition to Africa, and a
  supernatural being who knows the secret of eternal life. However,
  despite this promising laundry list, Haggard's execution leaves a
  great deal to be desired. A friend described it rather aptly as
  "a book with a lot of story, but not a lot of plot." Which is to
  say that in my edition, some 320 pages are filled without much
  happening. There is the initial mysterious set-up, the journey to
  dark Africa with the usual physical trials and tribulations, the
  heroes' conveyance to the "lost city", and then... and then
  things kind of grind to a halt. Lengthy descriptive details,
  lengthy internal ruminations, lengthy rambling speeches, lengthy
  everything -- but very little of consequence occurs until the
  very end, when the heroes make a dangerous journey to find the
  eternal fire which grants nigh-everlasting life. I suspect much
  of the problem stems from the book's origin as a long-running
  serial in the Gazette. As I understand it, serial writers of the
  time were paid by the word or by the installment, and thus, it
  was to their advantage to spin their plots out as much possible
  -- hence the unhealthy ratio of action to words. Judicious
  editing could reduce the book to 1/3 of its size without any loss
  of note. Of course, as another friend pointed out, it's probably
  best to read the book is small chunks -- just as one would have
  done with installments. Spreading out one's reading of it over a
  period of time, he suggests, may serve to conceal the book's
  rambling nature. In any event, there are some nice scenes here
  and there, such as the moonlight battle between crocodile and
  lion and another involving human cadavers used as torches, but
  those are about all I'm likely to recall from this book in a
  year. Of course, as is noted in the introduction to my edition,
  Haggard lifted the main elements of the plot, and even the the
  true name of "She-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named", from several earlier
  adventure novels by Edward Bulwer-Lytton, so one can't even give
  him much credit for imagination. I suppose the book is worth
  reading by those interested in literary representations of the
  prevailing xenophobic sentiments of Victorian Englishmen: racism,
  anti-Semeticism, misogyny, fear of miscegenation, etc., but as
  entertainment for the modern reader, it falls woefully short of
  the mark.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Sorry to disagree with all those reviewers who
  loved this movie, but Peter Sellers did many better films than
  this. "Dr. Strangelove" was the masterpiece. "Being There" is an
  underrated and understated sendup of how things happen in
  Washington. "The World of Henry Orient" (AT LAST on DVD!)is
  priceless but virtually unknown, with delicious performances from
  Sellers and especially his teenage tormentors. Finally, the "Pink
  Panther" series is much better slapstick than "After the Fox,"
  which has many famous, talented participants but is mostly silly,
  unfortunately not as hilariously and frenetically silly as
  Clouseau &amp;amp; Co. One irritant was the repetition and
  prolongation of gags and situations, as if we might not notice
  them otherwise. I agree with other reviewers that Victor Mature
  does as well as possible with the role he is allotted, and Martin
  Balsam does okay with his stuff, too. When watching this film, I
  kept thinking the same thoughts as when attending a mediocre
  restaurant -- I could have cooked up something better than this
  myself for a lot less money</Text>

  <Text category="book">Alright, so her childhood was a bit different
  than your average white middle-income childhood. Should this
  motivate anybody to write a completely non-imaginative, devoid of
  any insights book? Don't be fooled by the exotic side of it. A
  poor writer can ruin a story, regardless of the exotic locale. If
  you were expecting to find an "international" jewel like Jhumpa
  Lahiri's "The Namesake" or Zadie Smith's "On Beauty", you will be
  greatly disappointed. If you are into Africa, read something that
  has more than the exotic place to say for itself. Ben Okri's "The

  <Text category="music">Britain, circa 1997. Tony Blair is elected

  the next best thing. To be fair, the girls are not to blame for
  what a tedious flick this is. Rather, they are appealing and
  prove to be the film's lone redeeming factor. The fault lies in
  the script that tries to do for the Spice Girls what "A Hard
  Days' Night" did for the Beatles. Whereas the Fab Four's film was
  full of wit and cogent commentary on Beatlemania this flick is
  unfunny and basically incoherent about what it's trying to say

  <Text category="book">More Than Human is one of those books that has
  garnered high praise from the science fiction community because
  of its strong prose and original ideas. The writing is often
  compared to that of Faulkner but I wouldn't make that connection
  having read a few of Faulkner's works. Sturgeon uses many of
  Faulkner's narrative trademarks (i.e. streaming conscious, first
  person perspective of low IQ individuals, disorienting changes in
  first person narrative) but I didn't feel the net effect really
  compared to say something like As I Lay Dying. I love science
  fiction books and the readers in general love the genre which is
  why they want it to be taken seriously. This results in undue
  adulation and comparisons to mainstream books. More Than Human is
  slow, dated and not what I would describe as genre transcending
  nor would I recommend it to others. So the idea might of been
  original in the 50's but topics like telekenesis, ESP,
  computer-brain babies, and self produced morality and ethos have
  all been tackled more successfully in other science fiction
  classics before (Asimov) and since. This book rarely set off that
  wow! button in my head or kept me turning pages. This book simply
  did not have enough meat in it to make it anything more than
  mediocre at best. In 1953 there were 5 Hugo Award nominees for
  best science fiction book (Determined in a retro hugo award
  ballot in 2004) The Retro Hugo awards are fascinating because the
  voting (in this example) takes place 50 years later so the impact
  of the book on society can't really be ignored. Besides More Than
  Human, the far superior The Caves Of Steel, Childhood's End, and
  Farenheit 451 were among the other entries in a banner year for
  classic sci-fi. Needless to say, More Than Human did not win
  (Farenheit 451 did and rightfully so) Bottom Line: I wanted to
  like this book and it doesn't surprise me that others give it
  such high praise. These are probably people that don't read other
  genres enjoy congratulatory wankfests</Text>

  This is in no part due to the performances by the lead actors;
  it's the nature of the material itself. Perhaps if we were to see
  the James Mason character as a likeable star before failure and
  booze drain away his ambition and reason for living, the audience
  would understand what the Garland character sees in him and we
  could sympathize with both characters. Instead, we see Garland's
  character despairing over a not very likeable washed-up drunk and
  we're left feeling as empty as the film itself</Text>

  Don't waste your money. Not only does this book present a tedious
  repetition of facts and stories already well known to even a
  casual U2 fan, it can't even get those facts right! The book
  states that Bono's father dropped the family off at a Catholic
  Church before driving himself to another church. This contradicts
  the correct statement on the preceding page that Bob Hewson was
  Catholic, while Bono, his mother and brother were Protestant. In
  the same paragraph the Dublin neighborhood of "Glasnevin" is
  misspelled "Asnevin". The hearing aid shop from which Bono took
  his name is misspelled, and perhaps most galling of all, the
  author can't even get the full name of Larry Mullen, Jr. right!
  And this is just chapter one! I have to agree that this book was
  simply thrown together to make a quick buck and therefore not
  worth purchasing. I would suggest skipping this one and
  purchasing Bono: In Conversation With Michka Assayas, which
  includes a pretty good account of Bono's life from the man

  <Text category="dvd">I'm not sure what compelled me to seek out
  "Americano," written and directed by Kevin Noland. It's not as if
  I was dying to check up on the career of Joshua Jackson, a star
  of TV's "Dawson's Creek." Perhaps I was intrigued by Dennis
  Hopper's inclusion in such a small scale production--I mean the
  man is always interesting even when his material is less than
  stellar. Here, however, the lure for him seems to have been his
  daughter Ruthanna, who has a supporting role and serves as a
  producer on this film. Maybe it was international star Leonor
  Varela, a beauty who is surely one good role away from making it
  big in America. Most likely, though, it was the idea of seeing
  the movie as a travelogue of Spain. With great scenery, bull
  fights, Hemingway, hard drinking and partying, the Running of the
  Bulls--the atmosphere alone might have made intriguing viewing.
  However, I am going to be rather hard in my assessment of this
  film. I think Noland has talent and I look forward to other
  works. The film is photographed well and has good performances.
  My problem stems from the fact that there is absolutely no drama
  in this familiar coming-of-age story. With an astounding lack of
  real character insight, this little production about characters
  at a crossroads falls absolutely flat. The setup is simple. As
  recent college graduates, Jackson and two pals (who bicker
  comically) are spending the last few days of their vacation in
  Spain before Jackson must return to the "real" world and a new
  job. Facing the eternal struggles between childhood and
  adulthood, work and independence, freedom and monotony, dreams
  and reality--Jackson falls into lust with a local played by
  Varela. Should he ditch it all for this worldwind romance? Should
  he abandon responsibility for a life of leisure? Should he stay
  in Spain? These are legitimate questions and a legitimate, albeit
  familiar, story path. What makes "Americano" so tedious and
  uninvolving, however, is that the film doesn't allow you to know
  its characters. A character study with no genuine character
  development seems a hard concept to pull off--and "Americano"
  doesn't succeed in doing anything remotely deeper than the
  superficial presentation of friends on vacation. We never know
  anything about Jackson's job or life in America, or his dreams,
  passions, interests, etc...aside from this fleeting romance.
  Sure, the film goes through the requisite motions--Jackson writes
  pretentious poetry and talks to statues of Hemingway, what else
  would you expect in Spain? If he has artistic aspirations,
  however, the screenplay surely never develops this. Lacking any
  real guidance as to what Jackson envisions for his life, I simply
  fell into the camp of "who cares?" There are plenty of authentic
  moments in the depiction of Spanish culture. Dennis Hopper's
  role, however, as a club host is a complete misfire. Ultimately,
  though, my genuine disinterest in the film comes from a
  screenplay that asks me to care but never goes beneath the
  surface for emotional truth and character depth. Sure, Jackson's
  at a crossroads--but lacking any understanding of what he wants,
  it made no difference to me what he chose. Sorry, but that's a
  big problem when it is your film's central theme. KGHarris,

  <Text category="dvd">"St. Elmo's Fire" is one of those movies that
  could have been better, should have been better and yet, it just
  wasn't. It featured an ensemble cast of THE young and hot stars
  of the 1980s, the so-called Brat Pack (well, everyone but Molly
  Ringwald and Anthony Michael Hall, who were spared this misstep).
  Maybe this was supposed to be "The Breakfast Club - - After
  College", but while "The Breakfast Club" had characters, even
  stereotypical characters, that you could relate to, there is
  absolutely no one, with the exception of Emilio Estevez'
  character, that you care enough about to relate to in this film.
  The setting is not the John Hughes teen friendly Illinois, but
  Georgetown, where our bunch of Brat Packers have supposedly
  graduated from college. Uh-huh. Yeah, RIGHT. Judd Nelson and Ally
  Sheedy are living together and supposedly looking toward marriage
  - - problem is, Nelson is looking at and screwing everything else
  female that walks by and somehow hoping that Sheedy, in her prim
  and proper sweater and skirt sets and pearls can change that.
  Andrew McCarthy is their mutual friend who knows what Nelson is
  up to and secretly harboring a festering desire for Sheedy (or
  maybe it's just the pearls?) Emilio Estevez is a future attorney,
  working as a waiter/server and suffering a serious crush on Andie
  MacDowell. Mare Winningham is a dowdy, trust-fund type girl who
  is still holding on to her virginity, working in social services
  and fighting over marrying the proper dork that her parents have
  selected for her. She instead fantasizes about Rob Lowe, who is
  the pretty boy sax player in a local band, who has dropped out of
  school, married a white trash-y looking groupie, had a child with
  her and has now separated from her, and taking up with other
  groupies. Demi Moore is the wild chick who works in international
  banking, has a serious coke problem, stepmother issues and a
  problem with painting her apartment walls hot pink and with giant
  murals of Billy Idol. Sounds promising, huh? Well, in what is an
  early portend of the "Melrose Place" to come, Sheedy finds out
  what a dog Nelson is, dumps his ass, immediately jumps into bed
  with McCarthy, who is too desperately in love with her to realize
  that this is a rebound job; Estevez, after screwing up a
  lucrative house-sitting job by hosting a party there, travels to
  the snowy mountains to track down MacDowell and profess his love
  to her. He finds that she is holed up there with her boyfriend
  and despite being crushed, he lays a huge kiss on her and then
  heads back home. Lowe, in between faux-playing his sax and
  shaking his feathered head everywhere, takes Winningham's
  virginity and heads back to his estranged missus. Moore, after
  whining seemingly incessantly about her ill stepmother, has all
  her furnishings repossessed, loses her job and freaks out. Not
  exactly "The Breakfast Club". The real problems seem to lie in
  the characters themselves. With the exception of Estevez'
  character, they all seem like caricatures and horribly
  stereotyped. Their every action, every line of dialogue seems
  like just that - - they seem very one dimensional. Their
  so-called angst seems like a handy plotline device and nothing
  more than that. Winningham's character could have been salvagable
  - -except that she followed Lowe around like a sick puppy,
  knowing full well how he mistreated his wife and what a basic
  slacker he was. And yet, she still gave her virginity to him.
  Maybe if Winningham wasn't so bright, or she was a college
  freshman, it would be understandable. But she was a college
  graduate and seemingly intelligent. Lowe really had little to do
  with his role. Maybe if he had played the role Nelson had - - as
  the roving Lothario, with Sheedy waiting at home, it might have
  gone over better. With his too-pretty looks, it would almost be
  understandable how the character could get random women he just
  met to sneak into dressing rooms with him. Nelson just doesn't
  seem comfortable and doesn't pull it off - -but maybe Nelson
  might have been better suited for the sax player. Moore basically
  plays herself - -an interesting sidenote is that she was
  originally fired from this production for her drug problems,
  mirroring her character - - but was later rehired. While the
  title song later become a minor hit, "St. Elmo's Fire" itself
  missed the mark.</Text>
  <Text category="health">I bought this item for my wife exactly four
  months ago (9-15-06) and she said it was working well for most of
  the four months. She had concerns because the electrical cord
  which attachs to the unit rotates and when it rotated to certain
  angles, the heat would turn off (as indicated by the green light
  which is either off, flickers or solid). As she used it, the
  problem became more and more frequent. Now, the unit will not
  work unless it is at one point and at a certain angle (which I
  guess allows electricity to go to the unit). I tried taping it to
  that location but the cord also has to stay at that certain angle
  which is impossible to maintain when using the iron. This is not
  very good for such an expensive item which gets alot of twisting
  and turning use and should have the highest materials and
  workmanship to prevent electrical. My wife admits that like
  anyone the unit has been dropped, but that should not cause an
  electrical cord problem. Dropping the iron risks breaking the two
  flat iron ceramic plates, which are still perfectly intact. The
  problem is that because of the cord, and the way a flat iron is
  used, there is alot of cord twisting. For what is advertised as a
  "professional" device and at a cost which only a professional
  would normally purchase, we cannot believe that this could be
  used in a "professional" environment. My wife only uses it six or
  seven times a week, not six or seven times a day like in a salon.

  <Text category="dvd">Coming out at the same time as Ken Russell's
  rather more amusing Valentino, The World's Greatest Lover suffers
  from Gene Wilder's sporadic tendency to mistake the grotesque for
  the side-splitting. Thus we get the odd huge close-up of mouths
  covered in shaving foam and a lot of tiresome hysteria and
  tongues. We also get far more of Dom DeLuise mugging away as if
  semaphore were back in fashion than is strictly necessary, though
  he's not as OTT here as in Sherlock Holmes' Smarter Brother, for
  which we can at least be grateful. Unfortunately, we get much
  more of Wilder's tendency to mistake hysteria for the hysterical
  - when in doubt, shout seems to be his motto - with Wilder adding
  a nervous tic that sees him stick out his tongue when he gets
  nervous. And he gets nervous a lot. Be still my aching ribs...
  It's a reworking of Fellini's near career killing early flop The
  White Sheik, even including a Felliniesque lineup of hookers at a
  bus stop in one scene, only without Fellini's restraint (yes, you
  did read that right), with Wilder's unemployed baker heading for
  Hollywood to enter a screen test to find the next Valentino while
  his young wife seeks out the real thing. Wilder does acknowledge
  the debt in a screen credit that's part thank you to `my friend',
  but seems more name-dropping in a film that comes across as
  something of a vanity project - certainly with Wilder starring,
  writing, directing, producing and even writing a song for the
  film, it's fair to say where the buck stops on this one. One of
  those films that at once offers fairly lavish period production
  design but often a complete lack of understanding of silent
  cinema - yes, we do get sped-up comedy scenes - it's definitely
  pre-Kevin Brownlow's Hollywood, which completely destroyed most
  of the then-common myths about silent cinema that this embraces.
  Indeed, anachronisms abound, with the feel (and the songs) often
  more Thirties than Twenties, which perhaps wouldn't matter quite
  so much if it were all funnier. It's not a total disaster -
  there's the odd good line (a conductor announcing "Hollywood,
  home of the stars and several featured players"), a nicely
  natural performance from Carol Kane before she became a mess of
  mannerisms to rival Wilder and it does offer a once-in-a-lifetime
  chance to see James Hong playing a Norwegian (or is it Svedish?)
  studio executive, complete with excellent accent. (Also to be
  glimpsed among the bit parts in the supporting cast are Danny De
  Vito as an assistant director, Billy Sands - Paparelli in
  Sergeant Bilko - as a studio guard and, as the boss of a bakery,
  David Huddleston, here billed as `Michael Huddleston's Father'!)
  Fox's DVD offers a decent 1.85:1 widescreen transfer as well as a
  fullscreen version, with optional original mono or remastered
  stereo mixes. Aside from the theatrical trailer and trailers for
  three other Wilder films (Young Frankenstein, Sherlock Holnes'
  Smarter Brother and Silver Streak) the only extra is an audio
  commentary by Wilder that is so sparing and uninformative that
  you'll wonder if you clicked the wrong button on your menu</Text>

  <Text category="health">Look, the fact is feminism is about CHOICE no
  more, no less. I have the highest respect for stay at home
  moms--it is the hardest darn job on Earth. But this woman is WAY
  off base to say that feminism sold us a lie. Feminism GAVE us a
  choice. It told us we did not HAVE to pretend to believe we were
  June Cleaver if that was not what was in our hearts and souls.
  Personally, I could not have children and ONLY feminists have not
  made me feel like an alien species. I work with troubled teens,
  my skills do not go to waste, I spoil my nieces and nephews--I am
  fulfilled and happy. My sister is a stay at home mom with three
  beautiful boys, she is fulfilled and happy,FEMINISM gave us those
  choices, ladies. We were not "sold" ANYTHING, we were given much
  by the women who burned their bras before us. IF you feel
  belittled by staying home with your children and doing the
  world's most important job, I think that is YOUR issue and not
  NOW's. Stop blaming feminism for YOUR insecurities, if you are
  feminist--stop blaming your mother for your insecurities--you
  have choices BECAUSE of FEMINISM not despite it!</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">I watched this film yesterday at a library,
  and found its lack of depth and analysis to be dumbfounding.
  During the first minute, they tell how the revolution began when
  high bread prices sparked a violent uprising. During the next 99
  minutes they narrate the chronological events of increasing
  violence, using acted scenes, fake blood and sound bytes from
  "scholars", to give a "play-by-play" summary of the carnage and
  beheadings, leading up to a mention of Napoleon. During the last
  thirty seconds, they surprisingly conclude by saying that the
  French Revolution was a very good thing, because it inspired
  China and Vietnam and because Louis was a tyrant. Prior to this
  little or no mention had been made of Louis' tyranny, although
  the film had dwelt on his bedroom difficulties in some detail and
  also mentioned his weight problem a few times. After watching 90
  minutes of bloody scenes, I found the films conclusion that the
  French Revolution was a good thing to be an incomprehensible non
  sequitur. I would have liked to have seen some historical
  analysis to support this conclusion</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">Steven Spielberg's classic masterpiece JAWS
  did not have a stellar plot. It was a bubblegum storyline: a
  monstrous shark terrorizes a beach town on the east coast. In the
  hands of any other director, it would have been a terrible film,
  something to laugh at on lonely Saturday nights while chowing
  down popcorn. In the hands of Mr. Spielberg, however, it became
  one of the very finest and most memorable films ever made. Steven
  Spielberg's hands were nowhere near JAWS: THE REVENGE. Okay, so
  here's the plot. Remember JAWS 3-D? Well, that never happened.
  Chief Brody - from the first movie - is dead. His wife, Ellen
  Brody (Lorraine Gary), is living a happy life in Amity until her
  youngest son is killed - by a great white shark. Ellen flies down
  to the Bahamas with her other son, Michael Brody (Lance Guest).
  Though her family and friends assure her that she is crazy, Ellen
  believes that the shark from the first movie - yes, the one that
  Chief Brody killed - is back for revenge, hunting down her family
  and killing them one-by-one. Even though it died. In the first
  movie. Confused? Any sensible moviegoer would be. It's best to
  completely shut down your brain while watching the third JAWS
  sequel. As you now know, the story is completely absurd. The
  script, by Michael De Guzman, is unintentionally hilarious,
  filled with outrageously funny dialogue. For example, in one
  scene, pilot Hoagie (played by Michael Caine!) is courting Ellen
  Brody. HOAGIE: I have an irresistible urge to kiss you, Ellen
  Brody. ELLEN: Why? HOAGIE: Because ... it would not occur to you
  why. And if that's not confusing enough for you, feast upon this
  nugget of dialogue, from a conversation between Michael and Ellen
  Brody. ELLEN: Why did you come out here? Why did you come out
  here? MICHAEL: Mom! Mom! WHY did you take the boat? ELLEN: It
  [the shark] kept coming! MICHAEL: Don't you realize what you're
  doing? ELLEN: I've tried to tell you, there was nothing else to
  do! MICHAEL: Mom, you shouldn't have done it. ELLEN: I've tried
  to tell you, I've tried! Joseph Sargent's directing is terrible;
  it's clear that the actors have no clue what they are doing.
  Which may be why the acting is so horrible. The highlight of the
  cast is Lance Guest, whose straight-faced performance overshadows
  the very talented Michael Caine's by a longshot. The horrid
  acting is forgivable, however; after all, how could someone even
  attempt to keep a straight-face in a film so absurd? A film in
  which sharks roar, swim from New England to the Bahamas to kill
  family members, and leap thirty feet out of the water? On the
  plus side, JAWS: THE REVENGE is enormously fun to watch, thanks
  to its ridiculousness and unpurposeful hilarity. It is very
  likely one of the worst films ever made - JAWS 3-D looks like the
  original when compared to this film - but if there's nothing else
  on TV some late night, grab some popcorn and a frosty beverage
  and enjoy the absurdity that is JAWS: THE REVENGE</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I am amazed and mystified that most of the
  reviewers herein found the movie to be excellent!! As for me, I
  made it about thirty minutes into the film before turning it off
  in dismay. The fault in order of importance: poor screenplay,
  poor cinematography and poor performance by Pacino, who seems to
  be vying for the most over-the-top performance. The film was
  absurd in many ways from the outset: the pans from star to star
  lasting just short of giving the viewer any purpose for any of
  the fast camera pans. Close-up after close-up conveying no
  meaning, Pacino overacting like Jack Palance in one of his
  not-so-famous European pieces of tripe from the sixties and
  seventies, an utterly dumb plot with Pacino and company proving
  at the beginning that they are bumbling cops. First example, they
  chase the bad guy to a cabin which is on stilts or something like
  that; then, instead of staying on the ground below and smoking
  the bad guy out or something at least tactically sound, they
  storm the stairs and Pacino stands right in front of the door
  yelling "Police, you're under arrest." They kick in the front
  door and find that the culprit has escaped through an underground
  water source. Of course, Pacino follows and dives right into the
  underwater stream, having absolutely no idea where the guy is or
  if there are boobytraps of some sort. Cut to Pacino running
  around in nearly zero visibility fog, glimpsing the guy for a
  second or two before losing him in the fog. Stumbling around
  further, Pacino is obviously disoriented until a shot is fired at
  him from, we must assume, his quarry. Did the screen writer
  forget that Pacino's colleagues are also supposedly chasing the
  culprit, too? Inevitably and apparently not, because Pacino spots
  a figure in the fog and plugs him. As I watched this scene
  unfold, I became thoroughly disheartened when it becomes clear
  what I knew already, that Pacino has fired on and killed his
  partner. It was then that I decided that I had had enough. By the
  way, the European version, with Stellan Skarsgaard is infinitely
  superior. Don't waste your money or on-line rental queue on this
  Hollywood drivel. Ditto for the other Pacino junk I rented at the
  same time, The Recruit, which I could only stand for about a half
  hour too</Text>

  <Text category="music">Some will mistake me for a Evidence hater, but
  I'm really not. I just want the man to put some effort into what
  he does. I'm tired of taking just any ol' thing artists throw at
  us nowadays because the "fans" don't expect very much -- or
  simply don't know what good is anymore. Sure, you can relate to
  what Evidence is saying, but you can put on a dope instrumental
  CD, sit with a friend or knowledgable hip hop head, have a
  discussion about any topic, and the resulting feeling will be
  something like the feeling you get from this album. I quickly get
  tired of the "slow flow" -- see: talking -- and I feel like
  anyone can do it. I don't shell out money for things I can do
  myself. Really, the only difference between him and 50 cent is
  content. When I hear someone say "slow flow" my mind translates
  that into "reduction of standards to make it easier for cats to
  get on" because this album would have been thrown out the window
  before the jiggy invasion came. And lot of these beats, though
  very dope, are as slow as his flow is. Couple that with the fact
  that there are a lot of wack guest appearance from cats like Joe
  Scudda (I'm sorry, I tried to like him, but dude is simply
  terrible), Big Pooh (same goes for him), and Madchild and you
  have an album that can have a drowsying effect on the listener.
  The only dope guest shots come from Phonte, Planet Asia, and
  Slug. Yeah, I know the fans and jock riders will hate and call
  names, but I'm going to keep it honest -- fu** real. When Ev
  actually puts his back into it, he creates some dope material.
  "Down With New York City" is nice piece of work that has Ev
  gettin' busy over an air tight Jake One track. "Chase The Clouds
  Away" is another track where Ev does his thing over a pounding
  ALC production. The standout to me had to be "Line of Scrimmage"
  which features Ev and Atmosphere frontman, Slug, getting nice
  over another dope ALC creation. With the likes of Alchemist, Sid
  Roams, Jake One, DJ Khalil, Babu, and Evidence himself providing
  dope beats, I'd have to say that the production is definitely the
  strong point of the LP. Simply put, I don't recommend playing
  this CD while operating heavy machinery. I respect Ev and his
  whole crew (hell, I love Rakaa), but this album will make you nod
  off instead of nod to the beat. I can only call it the way I see
  it regardless of whether or not the artist is a favorite of mine
  or not. Bring on the unhelpful votes if you want, but I can only
  recommend this to the die hard fans -- who should eat this one
  up. Everyone else should download this and test it out first.

  I have to remove and insert battery to turn it on everytime! I

  back. Following up: According to the other review, I tried to
  make this scale "vibrating" using different ways of tapping. It
  didn't work no matter how hard I tried. I had to use my toe to
  lift up one side a little (about half an inch) and drop it on

  <Text category="dvd">What a disappointment! I absolutely loved The
  Black Pearl but was admittedly nervous about a sequel. As it
  turned out, I had every reason to be. It whole purpose of this
  movie seemed to be to return those characters from the original,
  major or minor, who seemed interesting. That they did but,
  unfortunately, the producers forget to give them a credible plot
  and interesting things to say. Depp seemed to play his role even
  campier than before while Keira must have, somehow, pissed off
  the writers so that they refused to give her any real meaty part
  of this movie. Legolas, I mean, Orlando Bloom also seemed to be
  sort of drifting along, sometimes good but more often,
  haphazardly. To my mind, the only real interesting addition was
  that of Davey Jones. Except for times when it was hard to
  understand what he was saying (due to the tentacles 'n all), at
  least his was a unique addition to the movie. I do sort of
  object, however, to associating him with the Flying Dutchman
  legend. The two have nothing to do with each other, fantasy or
  not. And don't get me started on the cannibals! Any way, I think
  this movie merits the two y'ars I gave it. While considerably
  beneath that first movie, it is somewhat watchable and even
  enjoyable at times, but it is most definitely not as good. And,
  as a final thought, the very last scene of the movie? Lose it
  entirely. It simply was unnecessary.</Text>

  <Text category="music">Beautiful voice, but so much anger in the
  lyrics ruins the cd. I was offended just reading every name on
  this cd...It is really a shame, what pretty "vulgar" voice. If
  this cd sells millions will you be proud of the message of hate
  you just pushed into millions of ears. You should be ashamed of
  yourself as an artist, as you have such power, but it is spent on
  prepetuating hate. Nina Simone was a angry artist also, but not
  once did she offend me (caucasian male) with her lyrics and all
  of her hate for racism in america. The first song I ever heard of
  hers "Mississippi Goddam" made me cry, so emotionally charged and
  commanding of a voice. There will always be a "racist america"
  because people are selfish, but be responsible as a descent human
  being and as an artist. I liked the cd until I heard the lyrics,
  one less sale adds up after awhile</Text>

  <Text category="book">I admit that I tried to read this twice and
  failed both times. I got to around page 20 or so. I'll probably
  try again. However, if you're an adult who has already read other
  philosophies I would suggest attempting to read it just so you'll
  know what Objectivism is about. I wouldn't suggest it for teens
  that haven't had any prior readings, though. Objectivism is about
  the self and about "reason", and it can be heady stuff for
  someone who has no real experience in anything else. The strange
  thing about the tone of the writing is that it comes across as
  venomous. I assume that's in my head, but judge for yourself. Her
  caricatures of "The Witch Doctor" (who controls others from a
  spiritual perspective) and "Attila" (who controls by brute force)
  are actually interesting. Wrong, but interesting. Since
  Objectivists rely on reason alone for their survival (or think
  they do, anyway), it's rather surprising the lack of logical
  thinking early in the book. My suggestion is to attempt to read
  it without dismissing her out of hand (she's not wrong on
  everything), or swallowing it all without using your own critical
  thinking skills. Judging by previous reviews, it seems there were
  plenty of both kinds of readers. If you buy into it, you can get
  a feeling of superiority over others in a kind of
  pseudo-intellectual way. If you don't buy into it, however,
  you're evil (either the Witch Doctor or Attila) and probably just
  too stupid to "get it". Why I didn't finish it yet... I just
  couldn't get past her ignorance of history, frankly. If you're
  writing a work of fiction, the historical innacuracies don't
  matter, but this isn't supposed to be fiction. I like history and
  most people don't, so it probably won't bother most people. Also,
  while she denounces religion, Ms. Rand has no problem hopping up
  to the pulpit herself. Like all other religions and cults, the
  world is messed up basically because people don't think like she
  does.</Text>

  <Text category="music">Well seeing all the reviews on here and being
  a former fan of sugar ray along with being bored to death at work
  I've decided to write my own review. I believe sugar ray had
  something special with the first two albums as well but as time
  went by they have gradually gone from ultra-hip, I just wanna
  drink beer and cause trouble types, to oh so sappy songs about
  love and how heart break sucks, nothing that hasn't been told a
  thousand times over. When I first hearsd Sugar Ray back in 97 I
  thought their sound was revolutionary, I bought Floored and liked
  all the tracks and soon found myself buying the first album, then
  the third, fourth, and fifth albums came out, the third one was
  alright i bought it for the songs that weren't radio friendly
  such as Glory, Personal Space Invader, and Burning Dog; And with
  the release of their fourth album I bought it as well, hoping
  that they would get back on formula; Yes as you might of guessed
  i was delusional; their music had seemed to had gotten worse as
  predicted.....Now with the release of their fifth album, they had
  already lost me as a fan so therefore, I give all three of the
  most recent albums of theirs a 1/5 stars for lack of
  originality</Text>
  <Text category="book">When I found "Hour Game" in paperback at our

  But I cannot believe that this author who wrote such gripping
  gems such as "The Winner" and "Absolute Power" could turn out
  such a dog. Long, boring, and confusing. I fear that Mr. Baldacci
  hired an "aspiring young writer" to "help" him crank out a quick
  book. I cannot pass this book along to my friends -- I couldn't
  do that to them. It will be tossed into our blue recycle bin.
  What a waste. What a shame.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My daughter received this as a gift &amp;amp;
  we all found it extremely difficult to use. I was not able to
  play most of the activities on the screens without first getting
  the handbook out &amp;amp; doing step by step which was still not
  very easy to figure out. It was not at all easy for a child to
  enjoy. There were very few activities my 6 year old daughter was
  able to understand &amp;amp; play. It is too advanced &amp;amp;
  difficult to use for the ages listed. The screen on the monitor
  was low graphics &amp;amp; poor lighting quality as well. This is
  a very expensive mistake that provided no benefit or fun to my
  daughter</Text>
  <Text category="music">I must agree with some other reviewers of this
  book, and say that it is a very dry list of factual data,
  interspersed with Bill Wyman's moans and boasts. His gripe with
  Allan Klein about money seems to be quite valid, but he mentions
  it about a thousand times. Mick and Keith get quite a pasting-
  again it seems quite valid, but do we need to hear it so many
  times? Bill opines that Keith Richard's voice is weak and that
  his own songs were ignored by the band. Listen to his only
  self-penned Stones track of the 60s, on &amp;amp;quot;Satanic
  Majesties&amp;amp;quot;, and you will conclude that this is quite
  a self delusion- his voice is far weaker, and his songwriting at
  that time was also inferior. The book seems to be more
  authoritative on dates, but we can only take Bill's accuracy on
  faith. My knowledge of the Stones is not enormous, but even I can
  see some big factual errors. For example he tells us that neither
  Taj Mahal nor Marianne Faithfull recorded songs for the
  &amp;amp;quot;Rock n Roll Circus&amp;amp;quot;. A recent re-issue
  has proved him completely wrong. As another reviewer rightly
  said, Marianne Faithfull's autobiog is a much better read</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Remember Spirograph by Kenner you played with

  <Text category="toys_games">My 11 yr old thought this was amazing but the

  broke. Because of that, the spider cannot "walk" now! Too bad

  <Text category="book">Let me get myself straigh here first. I have
  always been a fan of the Artemis Fowl series even though its
  started to fall into ruins. I loved the first one, and it was a
  wicked twist to the standard fairy tale stuff i ussually have to
  plow through, with the protangonist antoagonizing the fairies,
  instead of saving them from some kind of "evil" foe. Also the
  fairies were pretty cool, and had all of the problems of normal
  people such as sexism. They were high tech and armed with laser
  guns. Unfortunately the author put Artemis on the helping side of
  the fairies which took out some of the pizzaz. Now let me rewiew
  this particular book. ITs a horrible read. who in their right
  mind would read something about a twelwe year old kid who
  investigates mysteries with no new innovative concepts? no me.
  now add the fact that this mystery is completely absurd, i mean
  seriously a "barbie" doll girl who gets kids expelled from school
  just because they're boys. How old is the author anyways? two
  years old? well obviously he's not married thats for sure. I
  always thought that these books were aimed at 13 and 14 year
  olds, not four year olds. Anyways enough of that, the author also
  proceeds to put in someothing about a talent show and other
  garbage abouta possesive father. I read Colfer because he writes
  futuristic books, that are predominetely fantasy not preschool
  level books about an obssesed teen ager who doesn't even solve
  robberies, instead he investigates some dumb boys vs girls war.
  All of the wicked humor is lost, there is no action whatsoever,
  the main charecter isn't a genius with wicked humor, and the book
  reeks of drawn of bits from the others. Heavily downgraded, adn
  obviously the worst parts. DO NOT EVEN READ THIS THING. get some
  other artemis fowl books, or read Alex Rider,. thats a very good
  read.</Text>

  a frustrated child who can't operate start button alone. You
  could tape down the button and then the child must ask for you to

  <Text category="book">I'll start with the positive: The main
  character is a classic hero in every sense of the word - tall,
  good-looking, smart, humble, etc. The story was engaging and made
  for a quick read because it was easy to follow, carried the
  reader along and crafted as to have no wasted words. In short, it
  was a competent work of fiction. That's where my praise ends,
  because this is the type of work that contributes to our national
  problems by feeding false stereotypes and radical agendas. Sure,
  it's a work of fiction, no one is going to take it seriously,
  yada yada yada. But that's not true, is it? So many people in
  this country believe that this the plot of this book is plausible
  and even to be encouraged - - just look at the reviews to find
  the believers. Alright, here are my problems with it: First,
  politicians are corrupt and will sell-out anyone to maintain
  power, but that's not true if you're a conservative farm-boy
  elected despite your honesty from a midwestern state. In Term
  Limits, Vince Flynn just beats you over the head with the "power
  corrupts" mantra - he doesn't show it in the actions so much as
  just repeats it like the chorus of a bad rap song, yet from the
  lips of the Marine Combat Veteran Congressman who is our
  protagonist. You know what, though? There are people in politics
  on BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE who really want to do what's right,
  who really are trying to make a difference for the positive, for
  this nation and the citizens. In this book, however, the public
  is a tool to be used and treated as if they aren't smart enough
  to make good decisions. Second, murder is a viable answer. This
  repeats another mantra that conservatives repeat often - that
  they do the hard fighting and living to protect this nation and
  its freedoms so that the liberals can live in their fantasy-land.
  Come on, get real. This book touts a Special Forces Unit as being
  so committed to the Constitution that they are willing to murder
  high-level politicians and threaten the president with
  assassination if he doesn't balance the budget. And, they get
  away with it because it's really the right side to be on.
  Murdering our leaders is the answer according to Vince Flynn.
  Murder solves the obvious weakness that we have as a nation, that
  being elections. Elections apparently just get in the way. Third,
  the balanced budget. For years and years - until the time this
  book was written - conservatives cried about the budget. The book
  makes it the central theme. Balance the budget and make us
  fiscally responsible. It's important enough for a military coup
  supported by the protagonist of this novel. A Coup!!! Yet, when
  the conservatives did take power, despite Vince Flynn's prescient
  forecasting ability, they ran the deficit into uncharted
  territory and didn't flinch. Even when confronted by this
  atrocity of fiscal irresponsibility, they claim that NOW!!!!! the
  deficit isn't a big deal, that it's really just a function of the
  percentage of GDP and we ought to all forget about it. This book
  starkly reveals the disconnect between conservative priorities of
  the 90's and the realized result nearly two presidential terms
  later. It's like looking back in time to a parade of nit-wits.
  Fourth, the good guys don't do bad things. The Special Ops team
  kills only who they want and never any innocents - just the
  politicians. The bad guys leave a wake of messy slaughter and
  civilians whenever they use murder as a tool. Flynn spends way
  too much time making this point and beating the reader over the
  head with it . . . killing is good when only your target dies . .
  . but whatever happened to that oh so famous, though shalt not? -

  <Text category="music">i deeply love the music of joni mitchell. it
  is for this reason that i feel the need to warn you, to dissuade
  you from being too early enthusiastic about this album aven
  before having heard it (as i stupidly did). the fact is that so
  many people spend so much energy in praising it (a new mature
  joni! a return to the roots! a brilliant acoustic album! and
  nonsense like these...) that it is very disappointing and
  frustrating to see (well, hear) that joni has not changed from
  her foolish and useless music of the last 15 years (except "dog
  eat dog" which is superb, but only from a lyrical point of view -
  musically it's an '80s disaster). it is the first joni mitchell
  album that i felt spleepy listening. ok, some lyrics are quite
  good, but nothing compares to the joni of the '60s and '70s. so,
  i really do not get the point: it is so obvious to me that she
  has nothing left to say (how painful it is to face reality!), so,
  why should all of you praise her? just because of what she did in
  the past? ok, let us say that she WAS the greatest
  singer-songwriter of her generation (according to me, much better
  than bob dylan) and let us praise her forever because of that;
  but i truly cannot accept that we still flatter her in everything
  she does, even if what she does is boring and flat music
  pretending to be art. i would like to strongly dissuade you from
  buying this album (and anything else from 1982 up to now -
  except, as i said, "dog eat dog"). if you are still trying to
  introduce yourself through the divine music of joni mitchell, try
  anything you want from the 60s and 70s. really, anything. try to
  be open-minded and let her music flow through your veins. you
  have to be prepared, for it could be beautifully dangerous: once
  you know her, you will never let her go away from your
  soul</Text>

  <Text category="music">First of all let me clearly state that im from
  Atlanta and I am a diehard fan of Lil Scrappy and that is why it
  breaks my heart to tell you that this CD is garbage. Besides
  Money in the Bank there are no other standout cuts and it is a
  shame because the underground mixtape he dropped with DJ Don
  Cannon early last year was on fire, He and Cannon delivered all
  new tracks and there were all on point, that was of course before
  50's influence which brings us to our problem. The influence of
  Curtis Jackson A.K.A 50 Cent is very clear on this album. I like
  50 but he knows little of the way we make records down south. If
  the G-Unit boss would have just stayed out he way and let Scrappy
  pick and choose his own tracks, verses etc. everything may have
  been fine. The guy is a control freak and as a result nobody in
  the "A" is pumping this and it is a shame because when Scrappy is
  on point the boy is unstoppable. This CD is garbage plain and
  simple and 50's influence is going to put the the crown prince of
  the south's career in serious jerpody unless he quickly wise's
  up. This is an honest review from a fan that has been down since
  day one.I have bought all the mixtapes and everything else he's
  dropped but, im telling you If you the consumer buy this Cd you
  will regret it and to Scrappy ditch the G Unit do what's in your
  heart and get back to business.</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">Shekhar Kapur's vision of A.E.W. Mason's The
  Four Feathers is well done visually, but unfortunately much of
  the original story is lost to create a more fast-paced and
  action-packed plot. While the basic story is kept, many small
  details seem to have been needlessly changed. For those who don't
  know, The Four Feathers is supposedly about Harry Feversham, a
  man enlisted in the army. When Harry is informed he will be sent
  to war in the Sudan, he hides this information and quietly
  resigns from the army to be with his fiancï¿½,
  Ethne. However, life with Ethne is soon changed when he receives
  three white feathers from his army colleagues. Explaining to
  Ethne what he has done and that the feathers are a symbol of
  cowardice do not help Harry; in fact, she tears a feather out of
  her fan to make four feathers. Harry then sets out to regain the
  lost respect of his friends through helping them, in an ultimate
  goal to regain the respect of Ethne. For the most part, only
  minor details are changed from the novel to the movie; for
  example, the way that Harry's friend, Jack Durrance goes blind,
  or the fact that Harry disguised himself as a Greek, not as an
  Arab. The change that seems most prominent, however, is the fact
  that in the film, Jack Durrance knows of Harry's resignation from
  the beginning. This subverts the whole quest that Jack undertakes
  to find out the truth in the novel. In addition, the entire
  `battle' between the warden of the House of Stone of Omdurman and
  Harry and Abou Fatma was created solely for action value in the
  film. However, despite this addition of action, the movie still
  seems to drag at points. Films are almost never completely
  accurate when following a novel; that is why they are only based
  on them. However, as I've said, a lot of the changes made seem
  senseless. I would recommend this film to someone who has not
  read the book or who does not mind liberal film interpretations
  of novels, if they have an hour or two to waste. Those looking
  for a movie to keep them on the edge of their seats would be
  advised to find something else.</Text>

  <Text category="health">I've been using TrimSpa X32 for over a year
  and, with a decent diet and regular excersise, I've lost over 40
  pounds. The X32 formula has helped me maintain my weight with no
  side effects at all. I, too, decided to use TrimSpa Energy
  because it was new and improved, but was sorely disappointed. The
  Engergy formula is way too high powered (200mg Caffeine per pill)
  for me and has made me feel "sped-up", sweaty, greasy and just
  plain gross. And that's taking under the suggested dosage. I'm
  sure that it will help drop the pounds for you...at the expense
  of dilated pupils, shaky hands and acting sketchy. I don't think
  this pill should be legal and should come with stronger warnings.
  I'm going back to the other formula tomorrow...that is if I can
  get to sleep!</Text>
  <Text category="music">Nana has a beautiful voice, but her singing is
  monotonous, predictable. She lacks passion. Sometimes you feel
  she is reading the lyrics instead of really interpreting the
  song. In addition to this, the arrangements are unfortunately
  very poor. Her soprano range deserves a proper orchestra. Only
  love could be the perfect background music for a romantic dinner
  with candles, but this is not the album I would like to listen to

  <Text category="dvd">I'm making an exception to my usual practice
  of not reviewing anything on amazon, due to the utter vileness of
  this movie. I saw it when it came out in theaters and hated it,
  and then a friend purchased the DVD and convinced me to give it a
  second chance... all in all, this movie ended up taking about
  four hours of my life that I will never get back. The
  performances are thin and uneven, the plot is inconsistent, and
  the dialogue sounds like it was pulled from fortune cookies made
  by the cast of Friends. To be fair, this movie does face several
  major obstacles. It has the misfortune to depend on the "acting"
  of glorified Ken doll Freddie Prinze, Jr. and the vastly
  overrated Julia Stiles, and in addition to trying to rise above
  these challenges, it also attempts to survive the intrusion of
  Ashton Kutcher. It fails on all counts. I do not hate the whole
  romantic comedy genre; nor do I hate the "teen" movie sub-genre,
  under which some would place "Down to You." (In fact, "Can't
  Hardly Wait" is one of my favorite movies.) I simply hate BAD
  movies, and this movie is a true abomination. If you enjoy the
  experience of wanting to drill into your own skull, then by all
  means, buy this DVD. If, however, you value your sanity, then
  please do not make the same mistake I did; stay far, FAR away
  from this movie</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">The no-name comedians at the beginning were

  Tommy Lee that his genitals are the envy of barnyard animals is
  not an insult. And, after it's repeated ad nauseum, it's not
  funny either. Has Andy Dick ever been funny? Kimmel? Corolla?
  Sarah Silverman? Spade post-Farley? No. It's as if Comedy Central
  corralled the most unfunny comedians of the past 10 years. And
  the bonus features are horrible. The interviewer was

  <Text category="dvd">Die hard fans of writer-director David
  Cronenberg may find funny dialogue and grotesquely engrossing
  scenes in this sci-fi horror tale. That accounts for so many 5
  star ratings by other reviewers. That was not my reaction to this
  film. It was slow, uninteresting and the ending was a
  disappointment. I give it only 2 stars. The characters stumble
  through a virtual role playing game and pretend they are...
  gamers. Duh. Cronenberg needs more than ideas for his next film,
  he needs a good script and actors who are more suited for their
  roles. William Defoe is completely miscast as a gas station
  attendant. Jennifer Jason Leigh's wardrobe looks like
  retro-1980's. Jude Law does well except for a couple of
  unexplained accent changes. Beware of the tag line that says
  eXistenZ "makes the Matrix look like child's play." This film is
  no where near the caliber of the Matrix. If you are not a
  Cronenberg fan, I recommend that you pass on this dull
  film</Text>

  <Text category="book">This is a decent book on photographing artwork
  -- but not the the most comprehensive. The strengths of this book
  are that Mr. Saddington (1) discusses the use digital media, and
  (2) makes the process of photographing artwork very user-friendly
  by providing great visual references throughout. The
  user-friendly aspect is the book's strongest selling point,
  especially for artists who are new or novices at photography, or
  visually oriented (i.e., no patience for reading instructions
  that come with few or no pictures). Mr. Saddington's book
  provides pictures of what makes a bad negative
  exposure/photograph, and provides a concise explanation for these
  results, and does the same for an example of a good negative
  exposure/photograph. He also provides illustrations of setting up
  equipment and artwork for photographing. The weakness of this
  book lies in the general details provided ... unfortunately, Mr.
  Saddington provides a limited amount of helpful hints and leaves
  out specific details for for problem shooting ... I base this
  opinion on my comparison of this book with a book called
  &amp;amp;quot;Photographing Your Artwork&amp;amp;quot; by Russell
  Hart. If you buy Mr. Saddington's book, I'd recommend
  supplementing it with the purchase of Mr. Hart's book. The two
  books complement each other. Where Mr. Saddington's book lacks in
  details, Mr. Hart's book fills in the information gaps. On the
  other hand, Mr. Hart's book is very text heavy and has very few
  illustrations ... so if you're a visually-oriented person, Mr.
  Saddington's book would easily compensate in the area of
  illustrating this very important process. Again, Mr. Saddington's
  book is decent, but it should be used as a supplemental
  reference, especially for the visually-oriented person</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My nephew was very excited when he saw the box
  and the picture. Unfortunately, the inflatable suit is not really
  inflatable. It requires constant air to keep it poofy looking. It
  is basically a costume that has elastic bands around the neck and
  wrists and requires a blower (battery operated) to blow airs in
  to keep it looking inflated. The battery is heavy and will not
  stay put on the two inch diameter hole on the back side of the
  thin vinyl suit. Everytime he moves, it pops out. The fan is
  noisy so he ran around in the clingy, deflated suit for a few
  minutes and begged to be let out of it as the elastic bands were
  restricting him. He loves superman and loves having a cape. He
  opted for a regular white towel over the thin red vinyl cape the
  costume came with. I suppose we got what we paid for. Cheap
  prices doesn't equate to quality. I felt like my nephew got only
  a couple of minutes out of this toy. Would not recommend it to
  anyone else... Unfortunately..</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I am a 23 yr old mother of a 2 1/2 yr old. Not
  only are these children HORRIBLE singers, but there is a reason
  that most parents don't let their children listen to the original
  songs... they teach them things they don't need to know. I
  thought this would be a "kids" version that would get rid of that
  stuff when I let a child I was babysitting put the cd on... and
  was appalled at how much they talked about sex and other
  innappropriate things for children. They didn't take that out!
  Children are exposed to that every day in our world now, telling
  them it is "normal" and "ok". Parents have a big enough job to
  teach their children right and wrong with the way the world is
  today. It becomes a much harder job when you give them something
  that is for "kids" that teaches them that those things are
  "normal". They assume if it is ok for a kids cd, it can't be that
  bad. I think this is horrible and would never spend a penny on it
  for a child! Some of the songs I like in the originial version
  and do listen to, and this CD has ruined them! But when it comes
  to children who are too young to understand that it is just a
  song and doesn't mean what they say is ok... I think it is the
  WORST thing you could buy for your child</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I have been a long-time radiohead fan and,
  like many others, have been waiting patiently for a live DVD. So
  I was thrilled to find out they released one and immediately
  bought it without even looking at the setlist. It never occurred
  to me that they would release material that is nearly 10 years
  old! I couldn't help being disappointed when I watched this DVD.
  The constantly changing camera angles and general lack of concern
  for the song itself make this unpleasant to watch. In fact, I
  only watched it once and it has since been gathering dust. I know
  I would have enjoyed it much more had it come out when the songs
  were still in their prime. I've always that Radiohead was modern,
  progressive, and totally innovative. I appreciate their old music
  but they have come a long way since pablo honey... and it doesn't
  help that before every song, Thom mutters "this is a new

  which our doctor would like us to track at home. After checking

  two problems: First, there was no owner's manual inside. Since I
  kept getting an "err 2" message, I had no way of checking what
  that meant. (Amazon.com suggested I look online for a pdf version
  somewhere. Unfortunately, the Mark of Fitness' web site didn't
  have online manuals.) The second and more important problem with
  this product was that it was clearly very inaccurate. When I
  finally was able to get some readings, they were: 112/64, 106/60,
  96/61, 106/62, 109/64, and 115/62. Oh, how I wish some of those
  WERE my readings! Maybe it was just my misfortune to get that one

  <Text category="dvd">I rarely write reviews, but quoting Ebert(who
  inexplicably liked this!): I HATED THIS MOVIE. 1. Is editor the
  correct term to apply to Joe Klotz? I give him credit for making
  a move under 2 hours feeling like 4. If you want to see a good
  slow paced movie watch L'Aaventura. For a much better recent
  indie film about family life buy the Squid and the Wale. 2. If
  the director hoped to elicit the sterotypical slow pace of
  southern life he succeeded too well. Amy Adams earned acclaim for
  playing yet another dumb, but sweet southerner (see Forrest Gump,
  Waterboy). I guess her performance reaffirmed what Hollywood
  thinks of the south. Notice all the glowing reviews come from
  people either from California or NY. Does the intelligent
  southerner exist in the minds of studio execs? 3. I assume that
  people like this movie because of some form of self deception or
  masochism. I feel bad for the masochists, but not the pretentious
  pseudo-intellectuals who can conjure meaning from a film devoid
  of a plot or artistic merit. 4. RENT THIS FIRST and be thankful
  you will only lose 2 hours of your life not $19.9</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">My objection was the implication that the
  "stars" played a part in the film. I felt that the picture was
  completely deceptive. Ms Richards and Ms Hanna had less than 15
  minutes (maybe a little more but not much and possible even less)

  documentary about prostitution and it might have been an
  interesting and revealing film if the the stars had been left out

  <Text category="dvd">I am convinced you have to be one of three
  things to enjoy this film: male, born before 1935, or a huge
  Monroe fan smitten with anything she ever put out. Marilyn is so
  annoying in this I wanted to smack her, and Tom Ewell's character
  is equally a jerk. I am not sure why this movie was supposed to
  be funny. Is adultery funny? Not really. I don't mean to sound so
  conservative, in fact I'm quite the opposite, I'm pretty liberal,
  which may be why this movie bothered me so much. It is very
  sexist and dated and Monroe's usual portray of the harmless,
  stupid, breathy blonde bimbo so eager to please isn't very
  empowering to young women. The character she portrays has no
  name, is simply titled 'The Girl' a female puppet manufactured
  for pleasure. The jokes are dated and fall flat, no longer funny
  to modern society. I think 'The Seven Year Itch' is one of the
  most overrated 'classics' ever but what can I say, my 84 year-old
  grandmother enjoyed it. Maybe she was just nostalgic for the
  '50s. A much better Monroe comedy is 'Some Like It Hot' where she
  is less annoying and the humor still resonates to this day</Text>

  <Text category="book">There is no doubt that Antonia Fraser's "The
  Journey" is written in the author's usual wry, witty and highly
  engaging style (although I must say that I never before heard of
  sex described as "lugubrious.") There is also no doubt that
  Fraser has done a great deal to redeem Marie-Antoinette's
  shredded reputation by accurately describing her as being
  compassionate to the hardships of the French people. The book is
  full of vivid detail which makes it very readable. However, I was
  disappointed to see that Fraser resorts to many popular
  misconceptions. For one thing, why does Fraser act like Marie
  Antoinette was the only princess to be sent away from home as a
  teenager to seal a dynastic marriage? What about Sophie of
  Anhalt-Zerbst (Catherine the Great) who was also a young stranger
  in a foreign land? This sort of thing happened all the time - it
  was what being a princess was all about. I was glad that Fraser
  did not fall into the myth of Louis XVI's impotence/ phimosis and
  surgery and all that. She simplistically portrays him as being
  asexual, which was not true, because he told his aunt after
  consummating his marriage that he enjoyed "it." But never has any
  other biographer subjected the reader to the spectacle of Fersen
  and the queen fiddling with primitive prophylactics while
  consummating their grand passion. I must say, it is a first.
  Fraser insists that Marie Antoinette slept with Fersen for many
  years and yet gives no solid proof, while at the same time
  maintaining that she was a woman of high moral character. I
  usually do not think of a woman who is shared by both a lover and
  a husband as having a high moral character, but I guess Fraser
  does. Oh, well. It is such romantic fantasies that turn this book
  into more of a soap opera than a serious biography. I found it
  absurd when Fraser insists that the tormented queen of France was
  ultimately a martyr for the cause of the socialism and democracy
  which the French people now enjoy. If the queen had had her way,
  her descendant would be reigning today, and that is just the
  reality of it. For a better study of Marie Antoinette's
  relationship with her husband, I would recommend Vincent Cronin's
  "Louis and Antoinette." As for better biographies of the queen,
  let me join some fellow reviewers in the hope that the works of
  Delorme and Bertieres will soon be available in English</Text>

  <Text category="toys_games">Our almost-4 year old son loves dragons and
  has one of the Imaginext dinosaur sets, so we thought we'd really
  surprise him on Christmas this year with the Imaginext dragon
  set. While I'm very happy with how happy my son is with it (he's
  been playing with it for hours) I have a feeling we're going to
  be in much the same boat as some other reviewers. Pros: -
  Interesting color scheme - Good detail on most pieces -
  Re-configurable - The dragon figure is really neat - The trap
  door, rotating floor and other moving parts are a lot of fun for
  my son to operate - Got it on sale at the local Toys R' Us for 11
  dollars less than listed on the web site. Cons - The directions
  are picture-only, and much too small to see fine detail. - The
  pieces are not packaged together logically, so that the elements
  of the set are all in one bag. You have to open every bag and lay
  the pieces out in order to be able to find everything and even
  then there's some question as to whether you've got the right
  part turned the right way, per the above comment about the
  directions. - The whole thing comes tumbling down like a house of
  cards if you bump against it lightly/during casual play. I've had
  to put it back together no less than 5 times since I initially
  put it together this morning. Some of the connector pieces don't
  fit tightly enough into the sockets on other pieces, so they tend
  to just slide out instead of locking together firmly. I think
  that next year, we'll just stick to Legos</Text>

  differing from other's opinions, the crowd noise takes away from
  the music. B.B. said, in so many words, that Live at the Regal
  was far from his choice as his best recording. Typically, he said
  he wouldn't argue with success--and left it at that. There are so
  many good albums by B.B. You can't go wrong for $4.65 for the

  <Text category="dvd">Informatively, I have Mason's DVD's, which I
  quite enjoy. However, this CD, labelled, "BRAND NEW," contains
  many repeats and situations. In fact, at times I was ahead of
  Jackie Mason, mouthing word for word the joke and situation he
  was leading up to me. Mason spoke as if he was rushing to meet a
  deadline, to the extent that much of the CD sounded like
  gibberish. For most of this CD I sat stone faced and suspected
  that perhaps the applause and clapping of hands were canned.
  Mason, in my opinion, went overboard in his use of obscenities,
  loudly and in his asides,seemingly contrived for shock value. As
  for me, I think that this mislabelled, "BRAND NEW," CD was a
  flop, and I would not care to have it in my collection for fear
  of the impression I would leave after my demise. So, another item
  destined for my shredder. Finally, I would recommend the Mason
  DVD's, which I would have preferred with a slower delivery and
  less obscenities that add little to his performance. Robert Lyons

  <Text category="music">I purchased this album because I am a fan of
  the Last Poets. Upon listening to the samples provided by
  Amazon.com, I thought I was getting an album that would contain
  very similar content to the Last Poets: some great politically
  charged poetry, perhaps accompanied by some funky beats. However,
  when I listened to the whole CD, I was disappointed to find out
  that the vast majority of the tracks sound the most like "Get Out
  of the Ghetto Blues." If more of the tracks had the sound of the
  title track, this would be a five-star album, in my opinion.
  True, Scott-Heron has a lot of great social commentary throughout
  the album, but not in the form I had hoped for. I would take the
  Last Poets' album "This Is Madness" over this particular

  funny characters but I found neither very amusing. I have no idea
  why the two main characters fell in love with each other; this is
  by far the biggest weakness of the movie. Their relationship is
  not developed well at all. As another reviewer noticed, there is
  a bit of Pretty Woman here, as Dermot plays a male escort. For
  whatever reason, Julia Roberts as a hooker is cute, whereas
  Dermot is not. I found is pretty disgusting that Messing falls
  for a male prostitute. There is a lot of crude sexual humor that
  I didn't care for. My favorite aspect of the movie was that most
  of it takes place in the English countryside, which is really
  beautiful. Its not a terrible movie, but I would be upset if I
  paid $10 to see it in the theater</Text>

  <Text category="book">I tend to like just about anything that
  Brubaker writes. While I'm not as excited about his Marvel work
  as most others are, I have enjoyed his runs on Captain America
  and Daredevil. His work outside of Marvel has been great; Sleeper
  is one of my favorite series over the last few years. In general,
  Brubaker had not written anything that I genuinely disliked. Then
  came 'Deadly Genesis'. In short, this is a weak story with
  several plot holes which makes a mockery of a franchise that
  already has a history of reworking established continuity to poor
  results. To what end? Another Summers brother who is completely
  disinteresting, another story in which Professor X acts like a
  jerk, a dead X-Men (for absolutely no good reason), and some
  horrible reworking of existing long running history to cram it
  all in which now require secrets to have been kept by several key
  characters for the last 30 years. I want to think that this story
  was driven by editorial mandate. Unfortunately, this is the
  second instance in which Brubaker has went back and altered
  Marvel history from long ago. In Captain America, he made it so
  that Bucky never really died in World War II. This initially
  rubbed me the wrong way, but the story itself was done well, and
  the surrounding plots were good, so I begrudgingly went along for
  the ride. I was still able to enjoy his entire run on the book.
  His attempt to revise history doesn't work nearly as well here.
  The key difference is that Bucky had been considered dead for so
  long that there was very little continuity to adjust. He hadn't
  been written into any stories during all that time, so it was
  very easy to go and insert an alternate history for him. In
  'Deadly Genesis', Brubaker inserts events into key storylines
  from 30 years ago. In order for them to work, the reader needs to
  believe that several key characters has kept these events a
  secret from that time forward. It just doesn't work. To make
  matters worse, none of the characters' motivation for anything
  makes any sense at all. Characters are keeping secrets, and other
  characters are upset with that, and through the whole you never
  understand why. It's as if Brubaker had an end goal in mind, and
  simply crammed in any plot device necessary to get from point A
  to point B - even if it required characters to act contrary to
  their nature or the story didn't make complete sense. That aside,
  another difference between the two is simply that this series is
  not written as well as Captain America. They overall plot doesn't
  make complete sense and the characters are presented fairly
  shallowly. Reading it was more of a chore than an act of
  enjoyment. The interior art is nice, though not great.
  Unfortunately, the book falls so short on story alone that the
  art warrants almost no consideration</Text>

  <Text category="toys_games">My son loves the Color Wonder line by Crayola,
  so when I saw that they came out with a new creation called Color
  Explosion, which is another marker-type of product, I knew I had
  to try it. Now, I wish I'd saved my money. First off, you should
  know this product is not for preschoolers. Color Explosion is
  recommended for children 6-years and up. Now that I've played
  with it, I concur. I came upon this product when arrangements
  were made to watch my 9 and 10-year old nieces for a week. I
  thought the Color Explosion would be a hit, and I planned to
  treat them with this "art" related project throughout the week.
  They were excited to try it, and once I settled Monkey Boy, my
  5-year old, with a project of his own, we got started. At first
  glance, it looked to be a winner. The girls were having fun.
  Then, we started another page, and the markers became icky. Gummy
  is probably a better description. The markers were covered with a
  black film, which caused the images to look splotchy, and
  streaky. Crayola suggests you wipe the markers off with a paper
  towel, so we did. It kept happening. For instance, we'd draw a
  short line, and then we'd have to wipe the film off again. Then,
  we tried to wipe off the images with a paper towel. That didn't
  help either. Color Explosion is too painstaking for a child's
  activity. We began to realize that it wasn't a blast, but a
  bummer. Crayola warns against moisture, but even fingerprints
  will spear the pages, and the film comes off onto your hands, the
  table, and everything else. Oh, and if you use the glitter set,
  it clumps, and mixes with the film, and makes a liquidy black goo
  that stains fabrics. The company warns about staining, and
  suggests washing immediately, but come on. Did they even test
  market this product? What I thought would be an entertaining
  venture, turned out to be a messy disappointment.</Text>

  <Text category="book">I have been a huge fan of Michael Crichton for
  about 25 years. However, this book is misleading and dangerous.
  Almost every respectable scientist in the world now agrees that
  global warming is real and that we are greatly accelerating this
  problem (except some scientists affiliated with the petroleum and
  automobile industries). Writing a book that disputes global
  warming would be like writing a book that disputes the holocaust
  - Mr. Crichton could just as easily have written a book about how
  the holocaust did not really happen, and provide plenty of
  "references" to support this premise. Tragically, in the long
  term, global warming could be far more destructive than even the
  holocaust. I hope that someday Mr. Crichton recognizes that, in
  addition to his enormous talent for entertaining, he has enormous
  influence on people's thoughts and actions through his books.
  There is a quote: "With great power comes great responsibility."

  <Text category="book">Whether you're planning to read through
  Crowley's Book of Thoth for the first time, or if you think you
  know every little thing Crowley was getting at with it, this book
  is going to be equally useless to you. Several of Crowley's
  diagrams from the Book of Thoth are reprinted in this book much
  more clearly, but sadly that's the only good thing about this
  book. The book is filled with a lot of fluff. Duquette tells many
  useless anecdotes of Crowley's and Harris' lives, and constantly
  excuses and defends Crowley's character against those who would
  consider him a devil worshiper. Duquette explains in the book
  that he initially thought that when he first found Crowley's
  works, so perhaps its some sort of atonement. But the argument
  really has no place in a book like this where the reader has
  already come to terms with Crowley's character. Through out the
  Book of Thoth Crowley constantly alludes to and makes references
  to other works and various myths and systems. Having a reference
  book that explained all of these things would be an invaluable
  aid. Unfortunately Duquette doesn't do this. His background
  information is base and scarce. He does spend some time
  explaining about Thelema and Kabbalah, but as one would expect
  from a chapter long explanation of subjects like this, Duquette
  doesn't give nearly enough information to understand Crowley's
  works, and what he does give is easy enough to find elsewhere. As
  for offering anything knew or shedding some understanding on
  Crowley's work, Duquette outright fails. At times it seems as if
  Duquette doesn't even understand Crowley or the Book of Thoth and
  the associated tarot deck. I don't think the man even understands
  tarot in general (and Duquette's own tarot deck is evidence of
  this too). At his best, Duquette only manages to rephrase what
  Crowley had to say in the book of Thoth. Typically though a lot
  of what Crowley was getting at is complete lost in Duquette's
  work, a lot of it no doubt because Duquette never really
  understood Crowley at anything but a very base level. Reading
  through the Book of Thoth, there are a few ways in which Duquette
  could have made his book better. Crowley's phonetic translation
  of the I Ching doesn't follow the current standard, and sometimes
  the differences are confusing, especially if the reader is not
  already familiar with the I Ching. A key showing Crowley's
  translation and the standard translation would've been helpful.
  Likewise Crowley rarely wrote on astrology, despite astrology
  being alluded to many times through the Book of Thoth, and what
  he did write is hard to find. A chapter explaining Crowley's
  views on astrology would've been great. If that wasn't possible,
  then a list of books on astrology that were similar to what
  Crowley was working with would have been helpful. However
  Duquette's solution is to just tell the reader to go find some
  books on astrology to read. Duquette's book isn't useful as a
  reference to Crowley's work. Duquette doesn't seem to understand
  Crowley most of the time, and fails to adequatley explain
  Crowley's ideas. Besides some new-agey nonsense, like assigning
  celebrities to the court cards based on their birthdays, Duquette
  doesn't offer any new ideas or insights into Crowley's work.
  Except for a few nice diagrams (which are common enough and easy
  to find), there isn't anything worthwhile contained in this book.
  At least not anything you won't get out of reading Crowley's Book
  of Thoth</Text>
  <Text category="book">I only glanced through this book, yet my first
  impression is that it is a hodge podge of unrelated research
  without any attempt to analyze or comment on the results or even
  the quality of the research conducted or of the tools applied. I
  can, however, write about one of the editors, Mike Shaw, who made
  no attempt whatsoever to 'find the evidence' when assessing us as
  parents. He works as a Consultant Child Psychiatrist in London,
  England and seems to specialise in offering his services as an
  'expert witness' and trainer in the legal aspects of applying
  medical recommendations under the Mental Health Act. We had our
  children taken away on the grounds that they were "at risk of
  neglect". Mike Shaw was called in as an expert witness to
  interview us and make recommendations. Yet the reports that he
  submitted to court were unbelievably sloppy and ill researched.
  Under cross examination, he was vague and inarticulate and could
  provide no concrete evidence to support his assertions and
  recommendations. Luckily for us, he was so glaringly incompetent
  that we were allowed to repeat the process with another expert
  psychiatrist. I don't know about his co-editors, but if his work
  is anything to go by, the material that he collated in this book
  can only be equally sloppy and prejudiced. Here are some extracts
  from the psychiatric report that he submitted to court. Judge for
  yourself whether you can take anything this man does or says
  seriously. Evidence-gathering. "On 9.8.02, I interviewed Mr
  &amp;amp; Mrs Orman [2 hours] "On 21.8.02, I met the family at
  Trent Park where I spoke to Mrs Orman alone [40 mins], witnessed
  contact [1 hour] and spoke to the children without their parents
  [20 mins] [and] I interviewed the foster carer [2 hours].
  Observations. "Mr &amp;amp; Mrs Orman were friendly and
  co-operative throughout.[...] Mr Orman showed insight [... but]
  wasn't concerned that his actions may have disadvantaged the
  children. The couple were very robust in refuting the [welfare's]
  account, which they claimed was full of misunderstandings and
  misinformation. "Contact took place in the park[...]The parents
  and children seemed happy to see each other; they chatted in
  animated style. [...] I wasn't aware of either parent criticising
  the authorities in the children's presence "[Interviewing the
  children] The children seemed attentive [...] but answered "don't
  know", fell silent and looked at each other when I asked them
  questions [...] Erin related [a Simpsons episode where] Homer
  [...] had lumps coming out of his head because he kept his anger
  inside. I found myself wondering whether this was an oblique
  reference to concern about Mr Orman's temper but guessed that
  such an interpretation would be dismissed. [Note. This is
  submitted in court as an evidence-based legal document!]
  Conclusions &amp;amp; Recommendations "[...] I observed Mrs Orman
  as shy and anxious while Mr Orman was very pleasant but forceful.
  [...] "Mr and Mrs Orman say they have an easy affectionate bond
  with the children. So it is surprising that the foster carer
  finds the children uncomfortable with physical contact. [...] I
  think there is some insecurity in the children's attachment to
  their parents. [Note how this directly contradicts his own
  observations in the park.] "Were Mr Orman to be caring for the
  children on his own, I would be concerned about his sensitivity
  to their needs. [...] Asked whether he had any regrets, Mr Orman
  didn't take any responsibility for the deprivation and disruption
  suffered by his children going into care. [...] Erin [who was 8
  at the time] needs a parent who can stand up to her without
  losing their temper, and support and advise socially. I suspect
  Mr Orman would find this difficult. "My concern about Mrs Orman
  managing the children on her own would be a recurrence of her
  illness. [...] I wonder whether Mrs Orman has the strength and
  patience to handle these very challenging [sic] children.
  "[...]The children seemed very happy and natural with their
  parents during the contact I observed [sic] and the contact
  records make reference to the children wanting to go home. "[...]
  returning home is likely to further retard the children's social
  and emotional development. [...] "These children have very little
  capacity to protect themselves from what is essentially emotional
  deprivation and possibly abuse. [...] it is most unlikely that
  either parent can protect the children from any harm that the
  other parent might cause. I also find very plausible Ms
  [Charlotte] Curran's suggestion (... [in] her [written]
  statement) that Mr Orman dominates his wife. "The children did
  not express a wish to return home when they spoke to me, but it
  seems safest to assume they would prefer to be at home and would
  be alarmed if that was not possible. [..] I believe the children
  need a long-term placement away from home with experienced foster
  carers. [...] contact should be gradually reduced." Mike Shaw's
  answers under cross-examination painted a dire picture of our
  mental competence and subsequent parenting abilities, but he was
  unable to point to any specific evidence that he had acquired in
  his 6-hour investigation. Yet he remained adamant in his
  conclusion that the children should be removed from the family
  indefinitely and contact gradually reduced until no further
  contact be allowed, so that the children could lead a normal and
  happy life. He could not comment on government statistics that
  show that 70% of all children placed in long-term foster care end
  up as delinquents. Our children were eventually returned to us
  after we underwent a convoluted process to prove our competence
  as parents beyond a reasonable doubt; and the case was eventually
  closed. So much for the scientific and critical appraisal of our
  family by a man who regularly provides expert legal evidence and
  trains psychiatrists in making competent medical recommendations
  that supposedly satisfy basic human rights conventions</Text>

  <Text category="book">I generally like Elmore Leonard, this is the
  twelfth book of his I've read, ranging from his Detroit crime
  capers, to his L.A.-set Chili Palmer stuff, to some of his
  Westerns. Other than the terrible "Be Cool", this is probably my
  least favorite of his books so far. Set in the years between the
  end of World War I and 1934, the story follows Carlos "Carl"
  Webster from boyhood to manhood as the son of a wealthy pecan
  farmer rises to became a hotshot U.S. Marshall. The story takes
  place in the dusty Midwest, mainly around Tulsa and Oklahoma
  City, as Carl faces off with various wanna-be desperados seeking
  to make a name for themselves. Carl is a somewhat vain, cocky
  lawman, with a keen sense of what kind of quote will get him in
  the papers. His main foe is the son of a wealthy oil man, a no
  account young man who has everything he needs, but whose selfish
  nature and appetite for stirring things up leads him into Carl's
  path. Mixed into this are kinds of period details, from
  prohibition to Will Rogers shows to Klansmen vigilantes to "True
  Detective" writers to striking miners to mentions of various
  real-life bank robbers Pretty Boy Floyd, John Dillinger, and
  Bonnie and Clyde Barrow. Despite all this background detail, the
  story itself failed to engage me. There are none of the clever
  twists and turns that characterize Leonard's best work. There's a
  good guy, a bad guy, and an inextricable outcome whose resolution
  is surprisingly undramatic. In fact, about halfway through the
  book I realized that the "real story" wasn't going to kick in --
  I was in it! And unlike many Leonard books, the supporting cast
  of characters isn't particularly memorable. Even Leonard's
  trademark strong dialogue is mostly missing, subsumed by his
  attempt to stick to period speech. Ultimately, one gets the
  feeling that Leonard was most interested in capturing the vibe of
  the period, and perhaps didn't spend nearly the same amount of
  effort on the actual story. That said, the Depression and its
  effects are surprisingly absent from the story, given the time
  and place. All in all, unless you're really really into the whole
  '30s gangster thing, not worth the time.</Text>

  smoking and the coils in the back flared up and caught on fire.
  (There were actual flames -- although they quickly burned out) I
  took the dryer back to Sephora and I was quickly given a
  replacement. While I had dryer #2, I noticed that it took 15-20
  minutes to dry my hair, when it usually takes 20-30. However, I
  have the full size T3 at home and it takes about 10 minutes when
  I use that one. I was expecting this to offer the same power as
  the other T3. The bottom line is that I didn't notice a big
  difference between the travel T3 and the hotel hairdryers that
  are built into the bathrooms. After 6 months, the handle broke on
  the 2nd hairdryer making it rather challenging to use. If you
  want a great hairdryer, buy a full size T3, Elchim or Chi Pro --

  book isn't going to help much. There's very little political
  analysis, almost no attempt to portray what diffiulties Wilson
  needed to overcome, and no passion at all in the writing.
  Actually this book feels a lot like a high school term paper that
  someone knew they had to write and just wanted to turn in for a
  passing grade. Auchincloss talks a bit about the two Wilsons (one
  good one bad) and hints at Wilson's dependance on women, but
  neither of these positions is fleshed out or used consistently.
  Maybe Woodrow Wilson's life is just too large for a book this
  small</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">The pieces were very tiny and the sticker
  flags kept popping off the plastic. My daughter's favorite part
  was the pink and white horse with the carriage, which she
  promptly took over and put with her dollhouse. After asking Santa
  for a Cinderella Castle she was a bit disappointed. This playset
  would probably be fine for a child who was just going to set it
  up and not play with it</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I saw this crapfest in the theater and I
  should have known what I was getting into when we were carded not
  only at the ticket window, but at the entrance of the theater as
  well. I only gave it one star because there wasn't a "no star"
  rating--even though it deserves a negative rating. As a horror
  fan, I was intrigued at seeing the movie and as the movie
  started, it seemed to have alot of promise. But once we met Baby
  and her "family" the movie went downhill at an accelerated rate.
  The movie was disgusting, repulsive, and made no clear sense--at
  least with Michael or Freddie you knew what the h*ll was going
  on. And I thought that Blood Sucking Freaks and Blood Sucking
  Vampires from Pittsburgh sucked, but Corpses not only sucked, it
  blew. As a friend told me later, "What in the h*ll did you expect
  from Rob Zombie?" What did I expect indeed. No wonder most
  production firms refused to touch this film</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This is a review of the DVD, not the World
  Series. Please save your comments re the Series for the sports
  blogs. In this day and age, for Major League Baseball to produce
  a non-anamorphic DVD is absolutely pathetic. This DVD was made
  for a widescreen TV (16:9 ratio), but cannot take advantage of
  it, because it is non-anamorphic, meaning it will not take up the
  full widescreen. It has black bars on all four sides. They may as
  well have made it full screen instead, with a 4:3 ratio. Also, in
  its rush to make a lot of money by getting the DVD out quickly,
  they decided not to include footage from the season, to show
  nothing of the Tigers' play-off run, and to provide mostly filler
  with worthless interviews from players. ("Gee, was it exciting to
  be out on the mound!") I am an avid Cardinals fan, but this DVD
  was not worth the $14.99 I paid for it. Major League Baseball, as
  usual, cheats its fans. Another lesson they fail to learn from
  Pro Football</Text>
  <Text category="music">David Bowie always walked a thin line between
  commercially acceptable and just plain commercial. This is the
  first time he fell off and became just plain commercial. A
  disco-esque record, it's remembered more fondly than it was
  received by Bowie fans at the time. It has some good moments, but
  overall the production is just too slick and there's a dearth of
  imagination on it - China Girl is an old Iggy Pop song, Cat
  People is just a newer version of a previous single and Criminal
  World is a cover of a song by Metro, meaning there's a grand
  total of five new songs on it. China Girl proves a perfect foil
  for Bowie's melodramatic vocals, Cat People is still great even
  when smothered in too much production and Modern Love proves that
  you're (nearly) always gonna get at least one classic on a Bowie
  album. Ironically, while it made him a global megastar, this
  record also marked the start of Bowie's alarmingly swift fall
  from grace. If he'd stuck to the highly original work he'd
  churned out before this, he'd probably have had his moment in the
  sun anyway... and nobody could have accused him of selling out.
  Now, what's that they say about hindsight</Text>
  <Text category="health">Wow, I have never seen anything like this.

  <Text category="toys_games">I bought this for my daughter for her 11th
  birthday. After playing the game once, she asked me if I could
  take it back. She said that the game was boring because it was so
  limited as far as what you could do in the game. My daughter has
  always played a lot of "simulated life" video games (i.e., the
  Sims, Animal Crossing) and online games (i.e, club penguin). I
  suspect this is why she found this game limiting. Other games
  that she has played portray a more intricate "life" and therefore
  draw the player in to a greater degree. My advice would be to
  consider what your daughter is used to before buying this. If
  your daughter has no experience in these types of games, this
  game will probably be fine. However if your daughter has
  previously played simulated life games, she will probably find
  this one lacking.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Personally, I found 8 1/2 to be one of the
  most boring films I've ever seen. It was a pretentious,
  self-indulgent trip down the director's memory lane. I understood
  the plot, and enjoyed some of the thoughts raised near the end,
  but overall was bored silly by stilted, pointless dialogue.
  Having said that, the cinematography was stunning and the music
  almost made the film worth watching. Perhaps 8 1/2 would have
  been better off as a series of photographs with musical
  accompaniment :P</Text>
  <Text category="book">Well, the fact that I'm writing a review about
  this book, while it's sitting open on my desk next to my
  computer, open and not being read, might be some evidence of how
  I'm enjoying this book. This book just goes on and on in complex
  an unclear language about a subject which shouldn't be so
  difficult. This book is not clear or easy to understand at all.
  Every sentence is awkward and followed by a footnote, and the
  masses of footnotes together take up half of EACH page (!),
  making this work look like a research project for a PhD
  publication. I have the casebook in this series, and sometimes it
  seems reading the cases alone will bring more clarity. And it
  turns to be true! This book might be good if you're
  advanted-contracts and want to know every little detail, or as an
  advanced reference later on, to look something up like in an
  encyclopedia. Some concepts, which should be pretty clear just
  get too in-depth coverage in this book. It's too complex for a
  first-year student. Sometimes it starts describing the different
  views out there, and then there's a jumble in your head as to
  what the law really is. I wish the author used his own knowledge
  and fluid language more than footnoted ideas from other
  authors.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I saw this movie and was shocked at the
  contents, considering that it was aimed at children. It starts
  out with the gypsy Esmeralda doing a very provocative stripper
  style pole dance. While no stripping happened, there wasn't much
  other difference in the style of dance. Later in the movie, one
  of the men is obsessing over her in a manner I would never want
  my children to see. He sings a song about how she will burn in
  hell if he doesn't have her, and meanwhile a vision of her
  provocative dancing is playing out in the flames of a fire.
  Regardless of the rest of the movie, these two scenes make this
  highly innapropriate for children. Not to mention that the story
  is very untrue to the novel, which had a tragic ending rather
  than a happy ever after one.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">We were extremely disappointed with this toy
  that we bought as a Christmas present for our four year old son.
  The parking garage came with pre-drilled holes and needed to be
  assumbled. Unfortunately, due to poor quality, the pieces did not
  line up correctly and we needed to sand some of them down in
  order to make the toy functional. It would also have been helpful
  for the manufacturer to include one or two spare screws in case
  they got lost or destroyed during assembly.</Text>

  <Text category="music">OK - let me preface my comments by justifying
  the 2-star rating...It's Rodney Dangerfield - he was a class act.
  As for the CD: If you're looking for a few songs by a comedian
  accompanied by someone's cheesy clavinova, then this CD is for
  you. I bought this because of the last track, "Rappin' Rodney",
  and boy was I disappointed. It sounds like it was recorded from
  an old worn out cassette. Do yourself a favor - get all of
  Rodney's DVD's with his standup material and remember him for

  <Text category="dvd">This movie is just terrible; even more than
  MOST of the predictably terrible films in this genre. Women with
  terrible haircuts, dirty homes filled with poor taste in
  furniture, jobs a 16 year old would have - or no jobs at all,
  awkward behavior, barely able to function socially...UH+GH! The
  truth is, there are gay women out there who look great, have
  beautiful homes, have very progressive and meaningful careers,
  have talent and are entertaining and sexy. WHO SAYS this is
  representative?? Not in MY world it isn't. I am so sick of these
  painful displays of us. Anyone who gave it over 2 stars is
  childishly defending the genre in general, and not talking about
  this stinker of a film. The filming is poor, the sound is
  dull...don't waste your time.</Text>
  <Text category="music">what a shame. c.a. was such a talented and
  beautiful young woman but apparently got some horrible career
  advice. maybe she wanted to be this way, but most likely, it was
  a manager, or record company trying to create a even more slutty
  successor to britney spears. more is not always better, and in
  this case, it is definitely worse. hopefully, she banked her $$,
  cuz i can't imagine that she'll ever recover from this debacle.

  softcore, action thriller sucks? Ok. You might think there are
  two reasons (besides those two) to rent this: Nudity and
  Hilariously bad acting. Well, there is nudity, but not as much as
  you think. If you're getting it for Anna's naked flesh, be
  prepared to be more acquainted with your fast forward button.
  She's nude, don't get me wrong, in the shower, in the bed, etc.,
  but after that first scene, she is clothed and trying to act for
  a loooong time before the next scene. Her
  &amp;amp;quot;acting&amp;amp;quot; is probably good if you
  compare to how she acts on her TV show. she at least doesn't seem
  stoned. There is a plot that involves...just kidding, I have no
  idea! There are some actual actors and a Travolta sibling playing
  your typical mobsters found in these movies. The movie only still
  exists because of Anna being naked in it and there is nowhere
  near enough of it to make &amp;amp;quot;To the
  Limit&amp;amp;quot; more than a free rental, if that. I should
  mention that this is a review for the R rated version. I don't

  coherent Anna, go rent

  <Text category="music">This CD was a Big Seller upon it's release in
  1992, boasting a Plethora of Big Hits, along with some New Songs.
  Looking back through 2005 Eyelids, it's hard to hear why these

  Primitive Love Album, but as One keeps listening, He realizes
  that None of these songs have Passion or Depth, a few catchy
  Melodies and Pleasant, if Plain Vocals. The Dance Numbers at
  least keep You awake, but the Years 1988-92 found Estefan leaning
  on Ballads, and One was barely distinguishable from another; on
  top of that, the 4 New Cuts feel like padding, to fill a CD's

  are missing, too(i.e., Bad Boys), so to summarize, Nothing truly

  <Text category="health">I purchased the Waterpik NA-2 gentle sinuse

  Professional Ultra Dental Water Jet, since that is what was

  short, so they can't "click" into the water pik. The end result:
  Water leaks out, and there is no pressure through the sinus
  attachment. I had to return both items since the Amazon rep
  couldn't find any sinus attachment to work in the Waterpik Ultra

  <Text category="music">It was about time the spell Kasey Chambers
  originally cast on me wore off - I'd become a huge fan of The
  Captain and Barricades &amp;amp; Brickwalls, but there was all
  something a little nagging about even those two very good
  records. Chambers, a unique betty boop squeak of a voice, was a
  lustrous presence in rootsy contexts, and the best moments of
  those records were snarky updates on an old form, but the worst
  moments were forgettable alt-country duldrums of patched together
  cliches. Wayward Angel, Chambers' third album, had some great
  songs on it, but its pop and country predictability overtook a
  good half of the album. Carnival shows Chambers at her weakest -
  sad girl anthems of generic empowerment about the rain, bad girl
  anthems of doin-wrong that sound about as risky as songs on The
  Disney channel's afternoon lineup. "Light Up A Candle" fakes its
  slinkiness and turns dull, "Surrender" adds a Dido production of
  drum machines and computer bleeps that don't mask the song's epic
  ordinariness, ballads like "Dangerous" limp along to their own
  generic lethargy. Chambers isn't without charm - "Sign On The
  Door" and "I Got You Now" are impossible to not find fun - yet
  Chambers worst instincts as a song writer threaten to take over
  even the good songs - "Hard Road," a sad and moving movie-ready
  duet, borders on self-parody - lines like "There's a heavy
  jacket/ there's a heavy load/ there's a weight on my shoulders/
  it's a hard road" read like a laundry list of related lines from
  every sad and moving movie-ready song you've ever heard</Text>

  In my opinion all of her historicals are winners. SOME of her
  contemporary works are fabulous as well - Perfect and Paradise to
  name a few. There are other contemporary flops though (Remember
  When, Triumphant Heart, etc). Every Breath You Take was such a
  disappointment. The plot, character development, and writing was
  not up to par. I found it very hard to believe that a couple
  could fall in love in 2 days, be separated for two years and then
  fall back in love instantly upon meeting again. It was really
  forced. Someone mentioned it was "amatuerish" and I have to
  agree. I think anyone could have written this novel. I understand
  that the book was rushed, and to tell you the truth it reads like
  a novel that was written in a mad dash. I love Judith but this

  <Text category="dvd">Maybe it's just me, but I really don't see the
  appeal of this movie. It's an incredibly small production (3
  actors comprise nearly the entire film), with very low production
  values. Norman Reedus gives by far the weakest performance as the
  hitchhiker, but Alan Rickman and Polly Walker are not at their
  finest, either. (And I am an Alan Rickman fan just like anyone
  else who would even consider watching this movie.) If you are an
  Alan Rickman fan, chances are you've already seen your fair share
  of horrible and incomprehensible movies that leave you wondering
  why an accomplished actor would choose them. And Dark Harbor is
  just one more of these. Don't let the promise of a "nude scene"
  convince you to buy this movie - honestly, Alan Rickman is better
  appreciated with his clothes on. As far as the movie is
  concerned, the plot is unoriginal and not particularly engaging.
  It is a very dialogue-heavy film and the dialogue is not
  well-written enough to carry it off.</Text>

  <Text category="book">Homesick: My Own Story by Jean Fritz is a
  story about an American girl who grows up in China. She spends a
  good part of her life wishing she could be in America, where she
  belongs. WHen she's not doing that, she's corresponding with her
  grandmother, trying to make friends with some young chinese
  children, and learning british culture in school. As you can see,
  Jean Fritz would be an excellent storywriter had she made it up.
  However, this story is an autobiography, and is in almost no way
  fictional. Jean Fritz is an excellent storywriter anyway, though.
  Jean Fritz describes the setting as if her pen were a plane
  ticket. Her story line makes it difficult to locate the plot, or
  even understand the full story. The autobiography is punctuated
  by emotions. All in all, this is a fine educational history text,
  but is not, in my opinion, a fitting storybook</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I got this product for my daughter. The
  password feature was difficult to program and the voice
  recognition was so precise it was almost impossible to reproduce
  the right voice inflection and pattern for the journal to
  recognize. My daughter often could not make the journal open.
  After a frunstrating week or two, she stopped playing with it
  altogether</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I was very disappointed with this show. Having
  read the reviews I decided to buy the dvd, now I feel cheated.
  The jokes are weak, his inaccurate depiction of Africa and his
  off-the-mark African accent were more annoying than amusing.
  Jamie was crude, disgusting and even more disappointingly, not
  funny at all. He will look back at this and feel acknowlege that
  it wasn't his best performance. He had such good material to base
  his jokes on but he flopped quite badly. I do not recommend this
  dvd at all</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I was really excited about this toy because it
  was a stacking and sorting toy in one. And I love Laugh and Learn
  toys. I got it for my daughter for christmas when she was 16
  months old. She never liked it. I kept it out and encouraged her
  to play with it, but she just really didn't get into it. Also,
  there is a sticker that goes on the bottom of the top pot so you
  can see the shapes through the holes on the lid, and the sticker
  shapes don't match the holes! Unfortunately, this toy was a big
  let down.</Text>
  <Text category="book">Myths are important, but they should not be
  labeled history. 1. George Washington was not a great guerilla
  leader; he commanded conventional forces who fought in
  lines--just like the redcoats. Washington thought militia and
  irregulars were undisciplined and unable to face regular troops.
  2. Ronald Reagan did not begin the nuclear "disarming" of the
  Soviet Union. Eisenhower and Kennedy tried, but (LBJ?) Nixon and
  Carter were able to bring the ABM treaty, the SALT treaties and
  he START treaties to a point where both sides began cutting back
  their nuclear arsenals. Reagan did have success with theater
  wrapons in Europe, but the "big nukes" that could end
  civilization were already being cut back. This is an interesting
  book about Reagan and Peggy Noonan, but some of the history cited
  is WRONG</Text>
  <Text category="music">If this had been the first album in the
  "Hip-Hop Hits" series, it would not be a promising start. There
  are a few decent tunes on here, but as someone who admired the
  quality of the earlier Source albums, I must express an intense
  dislike for "Hip Hop Hits Vol.8". There used to be a time when
  The Source gathered the biggest AND best tracks from the rap
  indusrty for their compilations, now Benzino has turned the
  series into a shameless promotion for his own favorites (How else
  do you explain Ja Rule being here?). Here is a song-by-song
  analysis of this disaster: (1) YoungBloodz feat. Lil Jon "Damn"
  C-. This song is perfect example of why people are getting bored
  with "Sothern Crunk". It's lame and boring, as it shows Lil Jon
  becoming a one-trick pony. Not a good song to open an album with.
  (2) Wyclef "The Industry" B. Wyclef is very talented,but this
  song was never a hit. It should be heard for its quality though,
  even if it only touchs topics breifly. It is clear that Wyclef is
  above most of his peers in everyway; sorta like 2Pac. (3) Chingy
  "Right Thurr" B+. Not my favorite rap song,its better than
  average though, it kinda grows on you. He reminds me of Juvenile.
  It's content is not original, but Chingy makes it his own with a
  relaxed flow and style. (4) Young Gunz "Can't Stop, Won't Stop"
  C. If this standard work is what Roca-A-Fella has in it's
  post-Jay-Z future,the label is going to be in real trouble.
  They're good, but they have to be better than good to stand on
  their own. (5) Westside Connection feat. Nate Dogg "Gangsta
  Nation" B+. It was nice to see Westside together again. The style
  and talent cover up for the somewhat standard material. At the
  bare minimum, the song is stylistic and very enjoyable. (6)
  Ja-Rule "Clap Back" D. This anti-Eminem dis is just border line
  pathetic and lame. Any Eminem song is a bigger hit and better
  than Ja Rule's weak new stuff. If Ja Rule wants to return to his
  position "Pain Is Love" brought him to, he must work much harder.
  (7) Kanye West "Through The Wire" C. Kanye West has enjoyed chart
  success through alot of hype, but I find this song to be very
  pedestrian for rap. The lyrics don't define Kanye as an original
  rapper, and the use Chaka Kahn's "Through The Fire" doesn't make
  a very appealing beat. (8) Gang Starr "Skills" C. The group isn't
  that good to begin with, and this song has none of the fun that
  "Militia" had. Gang Starr has a decent, hardcore sound that needs
  to be refined in order to define themselves. (9) J-Kwon "Tipsy"
  B-.This song is fun to listen to, but that still does not make it
  any better than average. It's not really about anything and gets
  kinda tiresome towards the end; you may be looking at your watch.
  He's too overpraised. (10) E-40 feat. Clipse "Quarterbackin" C+.
  The track is enjoyable but was never that popular and is pretty
  forgetable. E-40 and Clipse just aren't that talented. It almost
  feels as if it was made strictly for the "Madden Football" video
  games". (11) Fabolous feat. Tamia "Into You" A. Just great, hip
  hop with style and substance. It's so nice to hear a gentler,
  more positive hip-hop songs; one that doesn't hammer the
  listener, but brings out emotions lightly. He is one of the best
  rappers of 2003; with both his album and it's singles. (12) T.I.
  "Be Easy" C-. He has been compared to Jay-Z and Nelly; despite
  the difference that he lacks the talent those artists have.
  Plain, boring, generic rap from an artist who ofers nothing new
  to the game; no more needs to be said. One must also wonder why
  this was chosen over his bigger (not exactly better though) hits
  "Rubber Band Man" and "Let's Get Away". (13) Cassidy feat. R.
  Kelly "Hotel" B-. A sorta fun track, R. Kelly does as much as
  possible, but he even he can't make Cassidy sound original. To be
  honest, this was a huge Top 10 hit though; so it kinda does
  belong here. (14) Ying Yang Twins feat. Lil' Jon &amp;amp; the
  East Side Boyz "Salt Shaker" B+. Surprisingly, the beat and
  production make this song rather entertaining. It's much more fun
  than it has the right to be; given the non-spectacular artists
  involved. (15) Scarface "Recognize" C-. Scarface used to be an
  exceptional rapper, but now he's trying to regain glory that is
  no longer his. Why listen to this, when you could just buy his
  older albums? (16) The Untouchables featuring Benzino
  "Relationship With Me &amp;amp; My Gun" C-.Just a standard
  Benzino track tacked on for shameless self-promotion. I wouldn't
  mind so much if the songt had actually been worth listening to.
  Atleast "Bang Ta Dis" on "Vol.5" was a good song. Bottom Line:
  *1/2. Benzino has ruined the once great Source series in the
  blink of an eye. If you want to hear a great Source album, buy
  "Hip Hop Hits Vol.4"; a Source album with the BIGGEST AND BEST
  raps of 2000. A few good tracks are not enough to balance out all
  the mediocre ones. To put it in short terms: with so many good
  compilations out there, why spend money on a bad one? I would not
  buy this album with a gift card.</Text>
  <Text category="book">I am not a right winger whatsoever, am against

  <Text category="health">We got this for our shower. Our son is now 2
  and the only thing we've used is the nail clippers. Which I
  actually really like the shape of them cause they are a lot
  easier to hold then just the tiny clippers, especially if baby
  starts to squirm a little. I couldn't even tell you where the
  rest of it is. The spoon thing and dropper for the medicine is
  cheap and useless. Any baby medication you buy you'll get a
  dropper for which works way better. The bulb didn't work well at
  all, just keep the one you get in the hospital, those work best!
  And if my little guy was sick he didnt appreciate having to sit
  still while I tried to take his temp. I recomend a therma scan
  for that. Just a quick beep in the ear and your good to go. So
  basicly, I would recommend to pass on this item and just get a
  pair of nail clippers.</Text>

  <Text category="book">Tim LaHaye, Jerry Jenkins, and others in the
  Pre-Trib circle, such as Ed Hindson, Tommy Ice, Chuck Missler,
  etc., continue to put forth the same deceptions that Hal Lindsey
  popularized decades ago. The notion of a pre-tribulation rapture
  is foreign to scripture, it is foreign to the teachings of the
  early Church, and it is grooming the Church for destruction
  through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really
  coming. These men are novices and not prophecy "experts" or
  "scholars" by any stretch of the imagination; they are those who
  tickle the ears of gullible Christians. Why continue to be
  deceived? Tim Cohen, in his excellent book, The AntiChrist and a
  Cup of Tea, provides biblically sound and testable evidence to
  show that the coming AntiChrist is known NOW. Not only that, the
  same author (Tim Cohen) has now put out the strongest
  presentation on the whole issue of the rapture EVER offered to
  the saints of God in Christ: The REAL Rapture. If you really want
  to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture, then
  you need to hear Tim Cohen's The REAL Rapture (based on a volume
  in his forthcoming "Messiah, History, and the Tribulation Period"
  series (see Prophecy House's web site for details on these

  <Text category="book">A subject of eternal fascination especially
  for basketball &amp;amp;quot;nuts&amp;amp;quot; who grew up in
  New York. We idolized the terribly tarnished CCNY
  &amp;amp;quot;Wonder Five&amp;amp;quot; who set an unbreakable
  record by winning both the NIT and NCAA titles in 1950 (it can
  never be repeated because of the way the tournaments are now
  scheduled). This book is a fictional addendum to Rosen's
  non-fiction treatment of the original basketball
  &amp;amp;quot;scandals&amp;amp;quot;, as he outlines in his NPR
  interview. Unfortunately there are glaring albeit minor errors --
  Broadway and 43rd Street cannot be on the east side of Manhattan;
  Madison Square Garden has been on 23rd Street, and is now above
  Penn Station; in between it occupied the block bounded by 49th
  and 50th Streets and Eighth and Ninth Avenues. These errors are
  particularly galling in a book by a New Yorker who played at
  Hunter College, and they undermine the author's credibility and
  care in writing. Since this is a fictionalized account of a real
  occurrence, the game of who is this really is inescapable. Hence
  it is most unfortunate that Rosen in his interview avers that
  some players who were not prosecuted went on to pro careers, and
  &amp;amp;quot;a couple are in the Hall of Fame.&amp;amp;quot;
  This tarnishes by inclusiveness such stalwarts as Bob Cousy (Holy
  Cross, '49), Dick McGuire (St. Johns, '48), Bobby Wanzer (Seton
  Hall, '46), and Frank McGuire, the legendary coach at St. John's,
  North Carolina and South Carolina</Text>

  think this is pitched as a baby video but it's really more geared

  recognisable tunes, I couldn't believe this

  that produced Praise You. Renegade Master is the type of track
  I've come to know and respect (that one is a keeper), and I have
  to give props for I Left My Wallet in El Segundo. Other than
  that, this album sounds like someone mixed songs from the first
  dozen records they found during their expedition to the flea
  market. If this is the sound you're looking for, save a few

  classic. The prequel to Charlotte Bronte's, Jane Eyre, is the
  story of Bertha Mason's childhood whose literary conceit is to
  tell us why Bertha went nuts. It's also a didactic dinosaur relic
  of the 1960s that traces the source of her madness to the fact
  that they didn't like little French girls in Jamaica. Racism,
  sexism, and classism drove Bertha `round the bend. There. I've

  appalled while viewing this film. I know it's a B Horror film but
  there was no orginality in this movie. I know it's suppose to be
  funny but come on people, was it really? The only part that was
  slightly funny was when Campell's wife was going after the Gypsy
  for the first time. Needless to say, I think it's interesting
  that this movie was a book. Going off subject, however, on a late
  night talk show Bruce acknowledged that there was no such thing
  as a PG-13 horror film. I'll conform with that.</Text>

  with her feet to the beat of the cheesy music. I found my neck
  hurt A LOT after that. The leg section would be good if there was
  another way to position yourself. The ab section too was so old

  <Text category="toys_games">I should have bought my girls ipods. Yes,
  these mini-muddles are cute in that they fit into little girl
  purses and pockets, but that's where the novelty ends. First, it
  is NOT abundantly obvious to children how to work the controls to
  get where they want to be. These are kids for crimy sakes! They
  needs to have controls that are clear and easy. My youngest has
  no idea how to get to a particular song because the buttons never
  do what she THINKS they should do (That's a big hint to
  Hasbro...don't design a product from an adults point of view.
  Design it for a child from their point of view. A button having
  multiple functions is very confusing for kids). So I end up
  having to constantly mash those itty-bitty buttons until I can
  figure out where the song is for her. Second, the process of
  getting music from point A to point B (point B being the
  mini-black-hole) is NOT a quick and easy process. Copy here, burn
  there, transfer to this spot, drag/drop to who knows where. Oy
  vey. And THEN you discover the music isn't in the correct format
  so you have to start all over again. As for the 128 worth of
  space...128 is a piddly amount of space but it is clearly
  advertised on the packaging that this is the amount you're going
  to get. No surprises there. Now if I could only get the darn
  music into the player without giving up and chuckin' it to the
  dog to play with. An ipod might be expensive, but Apple certainly
  doesn't cause this consumer the grief and frustration that Hasbro

  <Text category="music">History has a way of making the radical seem
  conservative, and certainly within the context of Cecil Taylor's
  music, his debut album, "Jazz Advance" is rather conservative.
  Taylor, known for his relentless, dense music, did not emerge
  fully formed (although even at this early date, his music is far
  removed from his hard bop contemporaries), but developed over
  time. For those of us who enjoy Taylor's music, this record is a
  historical curiosity, for anyone else, its either going to sound
  as one permutation further from the early Ornette Coleman idiom
  (indeed, this music is far closer to Coleman's sound than
  anything Taylor would be doing in the '60s or later). My
  understanding is that when this was first released, it raised
  quite a stir. Its a bit difficult to see why. Taylor is largely
  melodic-- performing pieces with coherent themes-- his
  experimentations seem to be in the use of block chords, odd
  inversions, and in soloing underneath the primary voice at this
  point. The record is four originals and four standards, and as
  one would suspect, Taylor largely breathes on his own
  compositions. He is backed by nearly inaudible bassist Buell
  Neidlinger and drummer Dennis Charles, with soprano sax player
  Steve Lacy on two tracks. Neidlinger and Charles are far closer
  in the hard bop idiom-- their performances swing, Charles in
  particular is playing way inside hard bop. This puts them a bit
  at odds with Taylor, who, while he gives more space than he would
  on his later work, is still more of a neoclassical improvising
  pianist than a jazz pianist. When Lacy plays, Taylor's form of
  comping doesn't seem fully formed, or Lacy doesn't seem quite
  prepared to play inside Taylor's environment, and as a result he
  sounds somewhat detached from the pianist. The sounds of the
  future can clearly be heard on several tracks, "Bemsha Swing"
  features many of Taylor's clustered chords and runs, solo piano
  take on "You'd Be So Nice to Come Home To" presents the theme in
  a barely recognizable fashion and is as close to his future
  organized chaos as he'd get, and while original "Rick Kick Shaw"
  is far away from where he'd end up, its the first sign of the
  short of aggression that Taylor would harness in the future. The
  music is enjoyable enough, but Taylor would reach such heights
  that its hard to not listen to this without comparing it to his
  future works. The other complaint is the sound-- this issue is
  from 1991 and is in desparate need of remastering. In the end,
  this is an album of historical value. If you're looking for an
  introduction to Taylor's music and aren't ready to dive head
  first into his methods, try "Looking Ahead!", its a far superior
  album by which point Neidlinger and Charles (who reprise their
  roles) were far more closely integrated with Taylor's
  music</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">I waited over 30 years to see this film, and
  now that I have -- I'm glad I waited that long. Its glaring
  defects might not have been so obvious to me 30 years ago.
  Nicholas, Alexandra, their daughters, their son, the people
  surrounding them -- not only are they not fictional, but thanks
  to the era in which they lived, they were photographed, we know
  what they actually looked like. So who on earth did the casting?!
  It was impossible to tell one Grand Duchess from another, and as
  for Alexandra -- in the first few scenes, I had trouble
  distinguishing the actress from someone in drag. Janet Suzman was
  the worst casting flub of all, unless you count the stilted
  manner in which Michael Jayston delivered his lines. What a stiff
  and boring character he makes Nicholas to be. Yet there are
  photos extant of Nicholas smiling as he played with his children.
  Nicholas was also portrayed as obsessed with holding on to his
  power as Tsar. But in the Robert Massie book after which the
  movie was purportedly modeled, it was very clear that Nicholas
  was acutely aware of his responsibilities to the Russian people,
  as well as to his family, and above all his son, the future Tsar.
  There was nothing exceptional about his behavior; most of Europe
  at the time was ruled by kings and queens, and to all of them,
  the thought of losing their thrones was simply unthinkable. Yet
  this film falls into the trap most of us do, of judging history
  not on the basis of its own terms, but with our usual
  spectacularly accurate 20/20 hindsight. Having been fed Soviet
  propaganda for 75 years, we have it entrenched in our minds that
  Nicholas was an extremely poor ruler. That's the stunning success
  of the Massie book, that someone who had absolutely no connection
  to Russians, and no connection to royalty save for the one
  coincidence of both their sons having hemophilia, was able to
  overcome the general (and erroneous) "knowledge" of his time and
  write the kind of sympathetic biography of this family that was
  long lacking. The movie, on the other hand, makes Nicholas look
  petty, and Alexandra slightly over the edge. One petty
  anachronism was the scene that showed the royal family praying
  just prior to Nicholas's sending off his troops into World War I.
  It was badly researched, to the point of ludicrousness. The Tsars
  of Russia were all Orthodox Christians. Orthodox Christianity has
  its own very distinctive music; in fact, Russian Orthodox chant
  is very different from Greek Orthodox chant. So what kind of
  background music did the director choose? Gregorian, of course!
  Can we at least *strive* for a little authenticity?! Apparently
  not. Massie wrote in considerable detail about the attitude of
  the Romanovs towards their captors, how their guards had to be
  changed every three or so months because they kept winning over
  the Bolsheviks: "You aren't anything like what we thought," was
  the most frequently quoted comment on the subject. The movie
  showed nothing of that. Well -- in the end, it was this exact
  trait of graciousness and consideration towards their captors
  that ended up getting the Romanov family canonized in the Russian
  Orthodox Church. That movement was well underway by 1971; I
  wonder, if the directors and producers had done a little more
  thorough research, if the film would have been a tad more
  sympathetic to these five people caught between two worlds and
  two cultures. All in all, purchasing the movie was a waste of
  money. Maybe the Bolsheviks over at the University's Russian
  Department will appreciate my donating it -- that way, others can
  get to see it without wasting their money</Text>

  German film of the same name for a college course entitled
  "Memory and Mourning in Post-War Germany." I'd just like to point
  out that the film is a horrible depiction of the novel. It seems
  that the director wanted to make a more "Hollywood" version of
  the film, and I think he succeeded. For instance, the entire
  ending is completely different from that of the novel, and in my
  opinion is completely wrong for the story. In general, the film

  my old one - with the larger water/heating unit, burned out after
  many years of use. The old one required more water and a bit of
  salt. It gave great steam, filling the rollers with a lot of
  steam, thus giving a better curl to the hair. This newer version
  does not require salt, uses very little water, and does not have
  the steam making power the older version did. I am very
  dissappointed in this "newly designed" product. I have packed it

  <Text category="dvd">...this movie is a dud. Who'd have thought
  that John Wayne and the director of "Support Your Local Sherrif"
  would have joined forces for this stinker! The characterization
  hints at being good, but really its character actors doing what
  they do best - being good support characters. Its a good thing to
  because the Duke really just mailed this one in. First - what
  this movie does well: -Ann Margaret is good and she looks great
  dressed up like a cowboy. -the supporting cowboy characters
  literally steal the show. -it is interesting that the bad guys
  chasing Ann Margaret and John Wayne and his cast of cronies are
  never ever seen close up until the very end. When you get to the
  end, you learn why, but it works well to keep them faceless. -the
  last 10 minutes is good - top notch with a twister of an ending.
  HOWEVER, what is wrong with the movie is stronger than what is
  right: -John Wayne is absolutely uninspired - he is just a
  cardboard version of himself - a cranky, mean man who they rarely
  even try to develop as a character - and when they do, it seems
  very, very clunky. -At least 20 minutes of this movie consists of
  long-distance shots of people riding horses. Sometimes, they ride
  over hills, sometimes they ride through valleys. We get 4
  separate long shots of them crossing a wide pond that is supposed
  to be the Rio Grande (the border with Mexico). Fill in this time
  with some character development! Some dialogue! Anything! -the
  character actors keep referring to other events in the past that
  sound a lot more interesting than this movie. All in all, it
  seems like this was the rough draft of a great script that was
  rushed to film just so John Wayne could have another movie in the
  theaters. Too bad, a crack team of writers could have made it
  something special. My suggestion, get "Cowboys" or either of the
  two "Rooster Cogburn" movies or "Support Your Local Sherrif" and
  see this actor and this director doing much better work!</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">This movie works if one of the following four
  descriptions applies to you. 1. You think Kevin Zegers is hot,
  you want to see anything he's in, and the swimming scene in
  Transamerica was the best thing to happen to you since you first
  had a peanut butter sandwich. 2. You think Nick Carter is hot,
  and want to see if he can act. (He can't.) 3. You like horror
  movies, no matter how bad they are, simply because it's a horror
  movie. 4. For some reason unbeknownst to man you are interested
  in what Judge Reinhold is doing with his career. Within the first
  five minutes of the film I had it pegged as a Friday the 13th
  style movie. Within the first five minutes, it was. Then it
  expanded a bit, and we saw some interplay between father and son,
  and also some rather useless and pointless teenage romantic
  angst. In this rendition, the headless horseman actually had a
  head. It was a pumpkin. And it growled. There was also some
  serious fire that he was capable of - apparently - in the
  beginning. This fire was not with him when he needed it the most.
  And, of course, he used a sword to decapitate victims Lucky,
  then, that Kevin Zegers' character was on the fencing team (odd
  for such a small town to have a fencing team, don't you think?),
  and when he was able to get his hand on a sword at the very end -
  well - you get the picture. Judge Reinhold was a riot in the 80s.
  In this movie he was a football coach who talked about how things
  were when he played ball. I can't imagine a universe in which
  Reinhold played the kind of football he was talking to his
  players about. He would have died during his first game. He did,
  though, walk around the house with a football jersey on, and some
  silly pajama pants, so I guess that fit the role of a football
  coach. Still. All-in-all, I was certain that this review would be
  a one star review. Then it came out of the "Jason woods", and
  became marginally better. I was interested in the film for two
  reasons. First, I'm still waiting to see if Kevin Zegers can act.
  I have a feeling that he's going to break out of the horror mold
  he's in and become a lesser Jamie Lee Curtis. Unfortunately, in
  Transamerica they had him play a petulant teenager. They didn't
  give him room - i.e., they didn't write anything for him - that
  would have allowed him to express any range. Either that or he
  doesn't have any. Second, I do like horror films, even bad ones.
  Which this was. Just because I enjoy bad horror films doesn't
  make it a good movie. Which this wasn't. I was just about to post
  this review, then saw the three, four, and five star reviews. I'm
  sorry - what were you guys smoking when you watched this? Are you
  kidding me? As a bad horror film, this succeeds. But bad horror
  films don't get three, four, or five star reviews. It's
  insane.</Text>

  British sitcom, I can't recommend this particular DVD of it. When
  I received it I was shocked by the fuzzy quality of the
  recording. Comparing it side-by-side on the same TV with an old
  VHS recording I purchased years ago clearly showed that the DVD
  image quality was much poorer than the VHS. I believe what the
  makers did was transfer from a second or third generation VHS
  copy of the original recording to DVD instead of going back to
  the original. The focus is so soft that both my wife and myself
  constantly squinted in an effort to sharpen the image, which of
  course didn't help. I doubt we'll ever watch this DVD because the
  eyestrain is too great. If you don't have a good copy it would be
  better than nothing, but not by much I was also disappointed in
  the extras. The "character biographies" weren't of the characters
  in the series but of the actors; very misleading. There were no
  tours of the actual estate used in the series or many of the
  other additions that would have made this a first rate DVD. The
  radio broadcasts were interesting, though several different
  actors were used which degraded the enjoyment. Also, there were
  only four of the ten radio broadcasts on the DVD. Finally, while

  <Text category="dvd">After watching "Harsh Times" we wondered "Is
  this a comedy or are they just mocking inner city life?" we
  couldn't believe what we were watching. It was meant to be the
  new 2006 version of "Training Day"--they even got Christian Bale
  to play the lead role--but only in the eyes of the people
  involved in it. It was a miscalculation and we'll explain why.
  Brief Story: The movie takes place mostly in the dangerous inner
  city streets of L.A. Jim Davis (Christian Bale) is a mentally
  unstable young Iraq War veteran. Now in the States, he is looking
  for a job as a cop. Jim's best friend Mike Alonzo (Freddy
  Rodrï¿½guez) is also unemployed, but when his
  friend comes to visit, they prefer to hang out and commit all
  kinds of illegal activities--selling drugs, guns, getting high
  just to name few. To spend time with his friend, Mike has to lie
  to his girlfriend Sylvia (Eva Longoria) making her believe that
  he is looking for a job. She doesn't know the world of crime they
  are involved in and the terrible consequences they might face.
  Review: "Harsh Times" has many problems, but the most notorious
  one is the crime "video game" feeling it has throughout the film.
  The characters and situations are so unbelievable that the whole
  thing feels like watching a "Grand Theft Auto" or "Scarface: The
  World Is Yours" video game adaptation with a little bit of
  "Cheech &amp;amp; Chong" in the mix. There is no climax--we just
  see them driving to different places, arguing among themselves
  and committing all kinds of crimes without anything conclusive
  until the very end. Christian Bale's accent in this movie doesn't
  help either, not only it changes through out the film, but we are
  not sure what kind of accent he is trying to emulate. The
  dialogue between the two friends feels forced and
  teenager-like--also there is no chemistry between them. The
  acting in this movie is disappointing, especially from Bale who
  we liked in movies like "American Psycho", "Batman Returns" and
  "The Prestige." It is clear that he was miscast this time. He
  just cannot do what Denzel Washington did in "Training Day."
  Because of his accent and terrible acting in this film, we
  believe this is his worst performance to date. This is something
  he doesn't want to add to his resume. The Verdict: Christian Bale
  Returns, but this new American Psycho cannot find his
  Equilibrium. "Harsh Times" tries too hard to create the edgy,
  dramatic style of the dangerous inner city life that "Training
  Day" had, but it doesn't even come close to achieve that goal. We
  laugh at the silliness of the story, overdramatic acting and
  Christian Bale whose fake accent in this film has to be the worst
  of the year. He probably thought he was going to get nominated
  for best actor. This is a miscalculation of great proportions by
  him and his agent.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I really enjoyed Goodbye Lenin, and it was
  mostly on the basis of seeing thatm film that I decided to watch
  this one. The film follows three idealistic, politically right-on
  young people rebelling against what they see as unthinking,
  selfish and uncaring Bourgeois consumer society. This rebellion
  takes the form of breaking into rich peoples houses, moving their
  furniture around, and leaving notes like 'You are too wealthy' -
  very situationist (never mind the fact that this point is
  probably largely lost on the rich people they break into). All
  this is fine and well, but the problem with the film is that on
  the one hand it glamourises these young people, and on the other
  paints every single other person in the film as some rich,
  ignorant Bourgeois pig. In the first ten minutes or so, I thought
  this might be a clever bit of directing, in which we view society
  as seen through their eyes, rather than society in its reality.
  However, this wasn't to be the case. The world remained
  Bourgeois, the kids are alright. The older generation Bourgeoise
  are bare cyphers, and none (with the exception of the man they
  kidnap) is given anything like a personality. When a break-in
  goes wrong and they have to kidnap the rich man who lives there,
  and take him away to a shack in the hills. During this time, they
  decide to 'educate' him about the wrongs of the world and the
  rich man's part in them. The rich man barely challenges the young
  people at all, and accepts much of what he has done is probably
  wrong. The anti-capitalist argument running through the entire
  film is very one-sided. I could appreciate the film a little bit
  more if it was balanced, but this wasn't. Furthermore, there are
  all the usual cliches associated with this type of work - the
  Edukators are young, good-looking and artistic - the subtext
  being that because they are arty, they can see things that others
  can't. At one point, one of the characters is on a bus when three
  men (presumably police, though its not made clear) hassle a drunk
  for not having a ticket. The character angrily bursts in and
  tells them to leave the drunk alone, gives the drunk his ticket,
  and gets off the bus. Do drunks even get hassled on buses by
  gangs of police? Can't say that's my experience - amybe they do
  in Germany. This is a recurring problem with the film -
  situations designed to show the main characters in a good light
  are contrived and unrealstic. The
  anarchist/marxist/anti-capitalist dialouge the characters preach
  is so generic that it actually ends up being meaningless - by the
  end of the film you don't actually know what exactly they stand
  for, or what their solutions are to the problems of society.
  Basically, the one-sided political argument hamstrings the
  characters development. Their views are never challenged, so they
  don't change. It is left to the kidnapping and love triangle to
  create the conflict in the film. The ending is also unbeleivably
  cynical, and completely undoes any idealism that had been
  generated in the course of the film. Generally, it feels like a
  script written by a 1st year politics student, being so utterly
  simplistic in it's 'the Rich are all bad' message. I would
  recommend this to anyone who is 17 years old and angry at
  society, but at the same time I wouldn't recommend it to anyone
  who wanted some insight into how we should solve the world's
  problems. There has been a rash of good political films lately -
  Good Night and Good Luck, Syriana, The Constant Gardener.
  Unfortunately, and given so much potential, this film is not one
  of them. Shame</Text>
  <Text category="music">In the classic and disturbing 1972 movie
  Deliverance, Lewis (Burt Reynolds) gives this ominous warning to
  Ed (Jon Voigt): "Machines are going to fail. Systems are going to
  fail. Then... survival." What, I wonder, will Richard D. James
  (a.k.a. Aphex Twin, a.k.a. AFX) do when the machines fail? It's
  been nearly five years since his underappreciated album drukqs,
  where we got a tantalizing possible answer to this question: the
  plaintive, lovely, Satie-esque acoustic keyboard nocturnes
  intermingled among the abstract, frantic electronic soundscapes
  throughout its sprawling duration. [Another intriguing solution
  was proposed on the album Acoustica: Alarm Will Sound performs
  Aphex Twin...] Chosen Lords, RDJ's first proper CD release since
  then, is actually a collection of various tracks from his
  "Analord series" of overpriced, elaborately packaged 12-inch
  vinyl singles that he's been cranking out over the last year or
  so. Those who were put off by the excesses and overt eccentricity
  of drukqs may hail these cryptically titled, drum-machine laden
  compositions as a "return to greatness." Indeed, AFX is certainly
  reviving a more compact, accessible (for him), and
  straightforward style here, with comparatively regular (though
  not quite danceable) rhythms and those comforting underlying
  simple synthesizer melodies. I have to say, though, that there's
  a disappointing and somewhat melancholy sense here of a great
  musical mind spinning its wheels. By returning to such familiar
  ground he seems to be setting up systems and letting them run
  their course in an almost cynical way, without any of the
  maniacal glee that was once part of his singular musical
  personality on unforgettable releases like Come To Daddy,
  Windowlicker, The Richard D. James Album, and, yes -- drukqs.
  Notably lacking are the voices that once regularly appeared in
  his productions -- true, they were usually rather unsettling,
  distorted, and manipulated voices, but at least they added some
  welcome humanity. Also missing are those rare but beautiful
  moments of repose (ballads?) such as "Flim," "Nannou" and the
  striking piano interludes on drukqs. In the end, Chosen Lords,
  while an undeniably interesting and expertly produced collection
  of electronic music, is nonetheless a sterile, static, joyless
  affair. If it inspires any emotion at all, it will probably be
  pity and sadness as you listen to a possible musical genius
  coasting along without exploring any new directions for the first
  time in his otherwise remarkable career. Yes, I'm afraid the
  machines have failed Richard D. James, and I sincerely hope he
  can survive in this cold and remote musical wilderness of his own
  creation..</Text>

  latest book. If I read this book not knowing who the author was,

  similar to the Plum series. Agree that the Pugg character is

  first time either of us have ever left while the movie was
  playing. Ever! Perhaps I'm biased. However I highly recommend
  that no one get this movie. The only reason I can think that
  anyone would give it a good rating is because of its political
  slant. I tend to lean to the right, but even I was entertained by
  V For Vendetta, despite it being blatant liberal propaganda. If
  you are going to pontificate about how we conservatives are evil,

  <Text category="dvd">I'm sorry, but this is honestly one of the
  worst movies I've ever had the displeasure of witnessing. I
  purchased it after reading ambitious reviews that cited this
  movie was what mainstream horro should be. In reality, it's
  nearly everything that's WRONG with low-budget films. First off,
  the camera work is horrible. Secondly, I've seen more convincing
  actors in elementary school plays. I mean, these actors make
  Keanu Reeves look like Denzel Washington. And finally, the story
  was absolutely horribly done. I admit, the premise itself had
  some promise--But the way it was executed completely took away
  any interest factor I might have had. Plain and simply, this film
  was unwatchable. I turned it off 65% through it. And I would've
  turned it off earlier but I was hoping for some beacon of hope to
  appear on the screen. If you care at all about quality, in any
  sense, DO NOT GO NEAR THIS PIECE OF TRASH</Text>

  <Text category="health">I recently purchased the Obus Forme Lowback
  Backrest, along with the Seat Cushion. Although I have heard
  people rave about the excellent support, and they felt
  comfortable enough to me, I can't give them more than 2 stars.
  The material used in their construction drove me to distraction.
  This is obviously a personal preference type of thing. Other
  folks may have no issues with the material at all. These are just
  my feelings on the matter: I found the texture of the fabric to
  be a little rough and it didn't allow easy movement when sitting
  on/leaning against it, which would drive me crazy after just a
  few hours at work. Also, when making any movements, the
  compression of the foam, and the friction between it and the
  fabric covering, made really annoying noises. It reminded me
  somewhat of snow compressing down when walking on it. The
  Backrest was even worse than the Seat Cushion because it had a
  thin plastic wrapping (looked sort of like shrink wrap or Saran
  wrap) around the foam inside, which made loud crinkling noises
  every time I even twitched. It was awful! However good the
  science behind the backrest and cushion is, the sound effects and
  unpleasant texture were distracting enough, to me at least, to
  return both items.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">For better or worse, after the relative
  box-office slump of ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE, producers
  Brocolli and Saltzman decided to woo Sean Connery back to do one
  more film for an amazing sum. Connery, who had said he would
  never do another Bond film, donated all of his money to his own
  foundation. While his performance is competent and smooth as
  ever, he seems all business. No longer in love with the character
  and having realized long before that the character was stagnant,
  Connery mechanically works his way through DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER,
  an outright bore of the Bond series and, in my opinion, one of
  the worst (certainly Connery's worst). While some have tried to
  save the film by arguing that it is a parody of the Bond genre,
  it plainly isn't. It was an attempt to return Bond to his former
  glory days and generate profit for the producers. Far from trying
  to lampoon the Bond formula, the producers were trying to
  resuscitate it. And they failed. After the opening "gun barrel"
  sequence, we quickly find Bond on a personal mission to kill
  Blofeld once and for all after the death of Bond's only true wife
  (discounting the false marriage in YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE) in ON HER
  MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE. (At least, this is what we must assume,
  since no mention of the marriage is made in DIAMONDS ARE
  FOREVER). Bond catches Blofeld in the process of producing clones
  for himself in an underground laboratory and, after a couple of
  struggles with both Blofeld and a duplicate, Bond drowns Blofeld
  in a vat of mud. It is a very short and quick opening teaser and
  immediately runs into the titles sequence. The titles involves
  various diamonds, slowly revealed to be various pieces jewelry
  worn by beautiful women, all set to the title song sung by
  Shirley Bassey (who also sang the GOLDFINGER title). The plot of
  DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER is quite strange. In an opening similar to
  GOLDFINGER, we learn that large quantities of South African
  diamonds have been smuggled recently and yet, surprisingly, have
  not made their way to the market. Worried that the diamonds will
  be released in order to inflate the diamond market, Bond is sent
  in to infiltrate the smuggling operation, disguised as Peter
  Franks. Bond quickly succeeds, meeting up with Tiffany Case (Jill
  St. John), an attractive diamond smuggler who is suspicious of
  Bond's identity. Bond's mission is almost compromised from the
  start when the real Peter Franks makes an entrance, forcing Bond
  to fight him in a terrific elevator sequence that is reminiscent
  of the train fight in FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE. After a smuggling
  attempt goes awry (thanks to Bond), Bond is discovered and learns
  of the real purpose of the operation he is infiltrating. It turns
  out that Blofeld is behind it all (Bond killed only two
  duplicates in the opening teaser)! Blofeld has been smuggling
  diamonds to create a laser satellite that is capable of
  destroying anything on Earth. Blofeld has been hiding his
  operation by posing as recluse Willard Whyte (Jimmy Dean), whom
  he has secretly kidnapped unbeknownst to the world, and using
  Whyte's resources and industrial facilities to manufacture his
  powerful laser. Blofeld plans to destroy various nuclear
  installations in America, Russia, and China. The purpose? Blofeld
  is organizing an international auction, offering nuclear
  supremacy to the highest bidder! Will Bond be able to stop him in
  time? DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER feels like a film that was stitched
  together, rather poorly, from a myriad of interesting elements.
  One feels that the producers had a bunch of ideas on the cutting
  floor and attempted to piece them together into a logical story
  order. The infiltration of a smuggling ring, the wonderful fight
  sequence in the elevator, the quirky and gay hitmen Mr. Wint
  (Bruce Glover) and Mr. Kidd (Putter Smith), a not-so-subtle
  rendition of the famous Las Vegas recluse Howard Hughes, a fight
  on an oil rig, et cetera. All of these elements are fairly
  interesting in their own right, but the combination doesn't yield
  what the producers were hoping for. What is it about this film
  that feels so ridiculous? One of the major problems, in my
  opinion, is situating Bond in Las Vegas. Bond in America is dull.
  His class, wit, and sophistication are only cheapened when placed
  in the cheesy context of Las Vegas in the 1970s. Bond is supposed
  to take us to exotic locations--not to a strip club. Furthermore,
  the action is not quite on par with the rest of the series. I
  think everyone will agree that the chase scene in which Bond
  escapes through the desert on a moon buggy is absurd. The chase
  is boring, the buggy looks ridiculous and prop-esque, and there
  is no suspense. The climactic fight on the oil rig is equally
  boring. Sure, we have a big set and big explosions. But there is
  no cutting edge stuff here. Connery, as mentioned, looks very
  tired here. Tiffany Case is a bit refreshing, but quickly becomes
  dim-witted and dull. And the Bond girl with the clever name,
  Plenty O'Toole (Lana Wood) is only in the film for all of five
  minutes. Blofeld is now played by Charles Gray, who first made
  his appearance as Bond's Japan contact in YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE.
  Gray's performance takes Blofeld back to the ridiculousness of
  YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE, even appearing in drag at one point. There
  isn't much more to say. The acting is dead in DIAMONDS ARE
  FOREVER. Now, some have tried to defend DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER by
  claiming that the film is an outright attempt to make a parody of
  the Bond genre. After producing six Bond films, the producers
  were ready to lampoon their own creation and move Bond into the
  Roger Moore pun-fest the series would eventually become. While
  this certainly seems to create an outlet for the film, it seems
  plainly false. If you watch the "Making of" documentary on the
  Ultimate Edition, it is clear that everyone thought they were
  making a real Bond flick and not a parody. The producers were
  trying to bring the series back to its former glory days and to
  produce big box-office success. They were not trying to create a
  subtle piece that exposed the hilarious features of the Bond
  formula. Anyone claiming otherwise is just engaging in wishful
  thinking and rationalization. This film stinks. Let's get over
  it. Ultimately, I think you should skip DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER. The
  only reason to see it is if you are a completist about the series
  and desire to watch them in order. It is an awkward insert into
  the series during the transition between Sean Connery and Roger
  Moore. The Ultimate Edition does have crisp picture and sound. If
  you must struggle through the film, make sure to get this edition
  because it is at least watchable. But if you only desire to watch
  the better Bond films, skip it. Diamonds may be forever, but this
  film died a long time ago.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">When putting together the mobile section of
  this item, I was very disappointed in its flimsiness. It looks
  like just a few knocks will cause the screws to break from the
  plastic. When I turned it on I was disappointed a second time,
  this time by the irritating buzzing sound that the mobile makes
  as it rotates. It's so loud you can't hear the music, which is a
  shame because I'm sure my son would enjoy looking at the moving
  lights. The third disappointment - the buttons are VERY
  hit-and-miss. Sometimes the music buttons don't work (the lullaby
  one worked eventually once I mashed it in really hard). That I
  could live with, but it's fiddling with the other controls that
  is really irritating. Control for music off, lights on/off and
  rotation on/off all seem to be tied up in two buttons. If you
  have the music and lights going, then turn on the rotation, the
  music and lights will go off as the rotation comes on. Then you
  have to press buttons in whatever order seems logical until you
  get them all going the way you want them. Please bear in mind I
  am NOT particularly daft - I managed to figure out my TIVO remote
  in a day or so - but the controls for this baby's musical mobile
  make no sense to me. I thought at first it was supposed to be
  deliberately challenging in order to stimulate 'baby's natural
  curiosity', but after two nights it really got on my nerves, and
  if I can't figure it out, I don't see how my one year old is
  supposed to. I can only think that there is something very
  screwed up with the circuitry in there. I'm not dismissing this
  item all together. The music is lovely - not too simplified and
  not too electronic-sounding. The Minute Waltz is particularly
  nice (I've noticed my son scans for it). The lights are lovely
  too, and do look pretty when they're moving if you can stand the
  buzzing. My son has come to depend on the music to amuse himself
  with as he falls asleep. BUT, if you buy it, I'd recommend
  testing the buttons and the motorized rotator before screwing the
  very flimsy mobile pieces together in case you need to return
  it.</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">They spend the first half of this movie saying
  how great the Ultimate Warrior was. The journey is awesome! Then
  all of the sudden, the paid WWE guys just began to bad-mouth the
  Warrior. Maybe he did have questionable judgment - but why are
  they trying to make us feel bad about someone we loved? They take
  some very low blows. They say that the Warrior was a bad
  wrestler. Actually he seemed just fine to me when I was young,
  and I really can't distinguish one's ability from the other. They
  just all gang up on him and make outragious allegations. Vince
  says quickly that the reason why the Ultimate disappeared for 3
  years was because he failed a drug test. As soon as he says this,
  they fade to black then come back with a new issue. What drug
  use? Which drugs? Presumably they're talking about steroids. But
  what about that high and mighty Hulk Hogan with his admitted drug
  use. Let's not talk about that - let's just keep ganging up on
  the Warrior. They completely ridicule him changing his name to
  the Warrior. And they also just try to badmouth him so much. Who
  cares that none of the wrestlers liked him? I don't! He excited
  the heck out of me way more than any of the dorks who say bad
  things about him -including Hulk. And oh yeah - they don't even
  let the Warrior defend himself. Why did I have to find out from
  IMDB.com that he was asked to appear but declined? Why don't they
  address this? This "docu" is more slanted than "Fahrenheitt 911"
  Every wrestling and Ultimate Warrior fan will start out loving

  <Text category="book">The first novel of Laurell K. Hamilton's Merry
  Gentry series is not, actually, that terrible a book. It's by far
  the best in a not particularly great series, actually. What made
  it almost impossible for me to read is that the basic premise,
  the set-up, is one of the most grotesquely, ridiculously stupid
  things I've ever read. Princess Meredith NicEssus has fled
  Faerie, in fear of death at the hands of her aunt, Andais, the
  Queen of Air and Darkness and ruler of the Unseelie Court. High
  profile fae in this world are major public figures, like rock
  stars or the royal family of England. The sudden disappearance of
  one of the Unseelie royals is a very big deal indeed. Every news
  media in the world reports the story....and it never goes away.
  We are told solemnly that reports of Princess Meredith being
  spotted are right up there with Elvis sightings. Meredith's
  image, the story of her mysterious disappearance, is everywhere.
  I mean, neolithic pygmies living in deepest Africa know who
  Meredith is, and what she looks like. Meanwhile, Princess
  Meredith has disguised herself as a mortal private eye. Thing is,
  she hasn't disguised herself very much at all. Her supernaturally
  pale skin is now humanly pale skin. Her fae red hair is now human
  red hair. Her facial features remain the same. And with everyone
  on the planet wondering where is Princess Meredith, for years on
  end, no one recognizes her. Let me hasten to add, there is no
  magic involved in this, they honestly simply don't recognize her.
  And the crowning touch to this masterful disguise, the name
  chosen for her pseudonym to hide the fact she's actually Princess
  Meredith is....wait for it....Merry Gentry. Jesus wept. And for
  years, none of her co-workers, no one who knows her, says to
  themself, "Hey, wait a minute, that women who looks almost
  exactly like Princess Meredith....Merry Gentry....Princess
  Meredith....oh my God, Merry Gentry is Princess Meredith!" Nope,
  she's just incognito, baby. At which point I almost threw down
  the book and said, "You have GOT to be kidding me." It's
  absolutely amazing to me this made it through the editing
  process. Do Laurell Hamilton's editors do anything other than
  rubber stamp her writing? Given her past six or eight novels,
  including this one, I'm tempted to say: no, actually</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">This movie would get 5 stars if it were not
  carressing with one hand - portraying the Gospel of John

  written 200 years after the events, are by and large
  intellectually dishonest and quite simply inaccurate. Even the

  very sad to see people making a buck off the Bible, while trying
  to tear it down at the same time. The worst examples of Scripture
  put downs are in the 3rd DVD. I gave the movie to a relative
  without that add on</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Unlike many of the reviewers here, I'm not a
  biblical expert and really don't care if the movie adheres to the
  stories as they are portrayed in the bible. I would just judge
  the movie based on its entertainment value and ability to engage
  me emotionally. The biggest problem with this movie was that it
  simply seemed to be too long and drawn out. There were also some
  scenes that felt like padding and added nothing to the story (and
  in some cases detracted from it). For instance, during the long
  voyage while the earth was covered by water, everyone goes a bit
  crazy. That's an acceptable premise but it's played out
  theatrically for far too long and in a variety of embarrassing
  scenes for the actors. The idea that they suffered madness was
  fine to introduce but it shouldn't have taken up so much time nor
  been quite so adbsurdly plotted out like a little play. There
  were also a couple of ridiculous encounters on the water (between
  Lot acting as a pirate and a merchant who sold them various
  trinkets for water) which undermined the entire story of the
  great flood. Everyone was supposed to have perished in the flood
  and it was a bit absurd that a few would be sailing the high seas
  on little boats. It was just plain silly and, again, seemed to be
  put in just to pad the story or add unnecessary "spice" (it
  didn't work as a means of jazzing up the story). I'm guessing the
  writers felt the time on the water had to be long to show how
  Noah and his family suffered or had their faith tested but they
  also felt it had to be more interesting than just lounging on the
  boat and taking care of the animals. This type of insecurity with
  telling a story in the most effective way is what causes so many
  productions to go bad. To the movie's credit, the actors are
  quite good and there are some good moments but too much of the
  movie doesn't work.</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">This movie was only slightly better than your
  basic horror cliche; the nuclear testing/mutant premise seemed
  promising, but all the main characters were stupid/annoying.
  Seemingly to make up for the lack of interesting characters, the
  script-writers/director threw in lots of unnecessary gore. For
  the most part, though, the special effects were at least
  well-done; however, a few of the effects were somewhat misguided.
  For instance, blood on bodies that have been sitting out for
  awhile in the hot desert is red; wouldn't it dry to brown very
  shortly in that kind of heat?? Acting was mediocre. I've never
  seen the original, so I cannot say whether this is better or
  worse. The movie is not for the faint-of-heart simply because of
  the gore, but it definitely wasn't very scary. Two stars</Text>

  <Text category="music">I am a huge fan of BTNH, but even I will
  admitt this is not a good album. The worst being "Home" which
  uses samples from Phil Collins. The whole thing feels kind of
  empty, with very little of the passion that you would hear on the
  groups earlier works. There are a few songs worth listening to.
  Most notably is "Clevland is the City" which is one of the only
  songs that still sounds like it has any "harmony" to it. Other
  songs worth mentioning are "What About Us", "Not my baby" and
  "Pump,Pump",the rest of the album in my opinion is garbage. It is
  not surprising that the group broke up shortly after this album

  Heiress, but I'm not sure why the media gives her so much
  attention. All she did was live off her family fortune, but now
  thanks to that fortune, she was able to get the right contacts,
  to make her own record label called "heiress records" which is a
  sub-label of Warner Bros. After a reality show series, modeling
  career, A sex tape, and a couple of roles in a few movies, what
  did she think to herself? I think I want to be a singer now?
  Apparently. And thats how this flaming pile of garbage came

  "Paris" and let me tell you it's nothing new or original. The

  <Text category="toys_games">Like many overhead gym type toys, this one
  turns out to be for short or legless babies. When my daughter
  kicks the kickplates, she kicks the toy right away from her (and
  this is on carpet), and when we brace the toy against something,
  she kicks herself right out from under the toy. We have found the
  same to be true for a number of similarly designed toys. Now that
  we have looked at the box more closely, the baby in the picture
  has his/her legs bent really hard in order for the baby to fit
  under the toy. Our daughter is 3 1/2 months old and is already
  too big for this. On a positive note, this is a very well made
  toy in all other respects. Looks durable, as are all Chicco toys,
  and the music and lights are pleasant. Another negative: you
  apparently have to push the two hanging toys to get them to
  activate sound and lights, and most babies want to pull them.

  <Text category="dvd">Hank Chinaski can't hold a job, can't hold a
  woman, can't control his alcoholism, and can't make a decent
  friend because he wallows with the dregs of society. Chinaski is
  the lowest of the semi-functioning drunks, barely able to keep
  himself in seedy hotels and in liquor. Unfortunately, the movie
  doesn't hold much interest besides seedy bars and seedy people.
  Chinaski's struggles as a writer are only touched upon and not
  delved into. There's no budding poet or tragic talent underlying
  his alcoholism. The closest he comes to poetics, IMHO, is where
  he tells his ex-boss openly that he really needs his last check
  typed out now because he needs to get drunk. 'Factotum' is saved
  only by the acting and the ability of the costume designer to
  turn Matt Dillon (Hank), Lili Taylor (Jan), and Marisa Tormei
  (Laura) into sleazy characters who look rode hard and put out wet
  in each and every scene. The script is stilted, without any highs
  or lows to it. The movie isn't near as fatalistic as 'Leaving Las
  Vegas', or as hard hitting as 'Requiem For A Dream', and without
  any of the comedic relief from 'Spun'. The closest comparison
  would be the jaw-stretching yawn-fest of 'Drunks'. Even if you
  love addiction movies like I do, or love Dillon or Tormei, that
  still isn't enough to recommend this movie. If curiosity
  overcomes you as it did me, then rent the movie before buying it.
  It's earned two stars for the acting alone. Have a ball or
  something else to play with if you rent this, it's that
  boring.</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">Men of a certain age will remember how, when
  we were kids and this was played on TV in the early 80s, we
  thought it was so cool when a huge army of police officers fired
  so many shots into a house that it eventually collapsed, and when
  a bus was shot full of holes by an even larger army of cops. But
  those two over-the-top scenes are all this movie has going for
  it. The other action scenes are pretty silly and unbelievable,
  especially scenes involving a sniper in a helicopter, and atop a
  parking structure, both of whom were in "can't miss" positions
  and missed anyway. Moreover, if you know anything about law the
  plot is beyond silly. It involves Eastwood being sent from
  Phoenix to Las Vegas to escort a witness being extradited back to
  Arizona for a trial. The witness will testify about bad behavior
  on the part of the Phoenix police commissioner, and a corrupt
  assistant district attorney is involved with the commissioner in
  a coverup. Assuming a material witness can be extradited, which I
  doubt, the crime appears to have been committed in Vegas, so it
  would tried in Vegas, not Phoenix. And if the ADA prosecuting the
  case was corrupt and wanted to cover for the commissioner, he
  could just dismiss the case, and there would be no need to murder
  the witness. The idea that they would want to draw attention to
  the case by having 200 cops line up and try to assassinate the
  witness is beyond ridiculous. In sum, the plot and the action
  were both absurd,and the only interesting scenes were the crazy
  firepower overkill at the house and on the bus. But those two
  scenes probably can't carry the entire movie for the average
  viewer.</Text>

  stone-hard style in which this volume is so meticulously, even
  gorgeously at times, written. Didion strives to be so achingly
  academic that there is little real heart to this book and, worse,
  the result is a cold, humorless, colorless story that is at times
  an unappealing example of ideological abstractions and alphabet

  Madeline Stowe stars as Senga. Senga and her daughter Nat are
  driving at midnight after visiting Nat's father. They bicker the

  recruits her into a mysterious cult. And we are left with a nerve
  wracked mother doing all she hectically can to retrieve her
  daughter. Both the daughter and mother eventually learn that this
  cult kills people for their blood. Why they do so is never

  <Text category="health">If you're just mixing non-gas-forming drink
  mixes, this thing works acceptably well, but if you're mixing
  something like "Ionic Fizz" magnesium drink that fizzes up a bit,
  it's not very useful because it just doesn't form a very good
  seal, no matter how tightly you close it. As another reviewer
  mentioned, it's very easy to cross-thread the lid. Thicker
  threads and deeper threads would probably help. It is great for
  sipping though, and easy enough to keep clean. But I went back to
  using a plastic 16-oz milk bottle that always forms a tight seal
  when you close it. The seal on this bottle is too flaky because
  it's difficult to tell if you've cross-threaded it until you
  start shaking it. I'd have expected a bottle designed for shaking
  and mixing drinks would have paid a little more attention to the
  problems this has. I don't use this any more, because it's too
  annoying to worry about the seal and the cross-threading. Don't

  <Text category="health">As an esthetician I would advise against using
  these sort of products. They basically sand your face off. Please
  leave microderm and abrasive exfoliation to trained and licensed
  professionals. I can assure you that I am not just saying this to
  drum up business. I would much rather have people not do anything
  to their skin than to use a product like this. You initially see
  great results because of the aggressiveness of the exfoliation,
  but believe me, you will pay for it in the long run. The main
  ingredient in this product is aluminum oxide (also referred to as
  corundum), which is characteristically known for its hardness,
  and is typically used as an industrial abrasive in sandpaper and
  as a component in cutting tools. This material is rated as 9 out
  of 10 on the Mohs scale of mineral hardness, making it second
  only to diamonds in abrasiveness. You may argue that this is also
  the same substance use in clinical microdermabrasion procedures,
  but you need to realize that these procedures can only be
  preformed by a board certified plastic surgeon, dermatologist, or
  licensed esthetician trained in microdermabrasion treatment. I
  see people coming in every day who use these at home kits and
  products, and they all have the same issue; It worked great at
  first, then after some time they started to notice that it wasn't
  working as effectively, so they used it more often and harder.
  Exfoliation of the skin increases cell turnover and helps prepare
  the skin for hydration and moisturization when done right. When
  this process is done more often than necessary, or in an overly
  aggressive manner, you can end up damaging your skin and causing
  permanent scar tissue build up and inflammation. People don't
  seem to realize that there is oil on our face for a reason, it's
  there to protect and moisturize our skin. When you constantly
  cleanse and exfoliate your skin, you are doing more harm than
  good. Over stripping the skin causes irritation, break-outs, and
  heightened sensitivity that rarely can be reversed. When your
  skin is constantly bombarded by aggressive exfoliation, it's
  defense is to build up thicker layers of skin for protection. So
  please, if you do use this, use extreme caution, don't use it on
  your face, and do not use it more than once a week, if that. Ask
  any esthetician, plastic surgeon, or dermatologist out there and
  they'll tell you the same thing: there is a reason people don't
  get facials, chemical peels, and microderm every day, or even
  more once a month. The adage "too much of a good thing" stands
  true here. if you need more convincing, please refer to the
  following links and make the decision your self. [...</Text>

  These Hollywood versions of a fake historic events make me
  cringe. Especially when Hollywood exec's send their " talent" to
  making the rounds on talk shows to plug the painful" blockbuster"
  that's going to be a BIG FLOP and they know it but they think
  people are stupid (and most of us are) but Hollywood hates to
  lose money so they put a spin on it anyway, I'd laugh if it
  wern't so sad. Anyway, Tom's army unit was choosen to update the
  Japanese army at the request of the puppet emperor , but really
  it's the emperor's councelor who makes all the decisions, so, the
  evil councelor decides to "westernize" his army the samuri
  swordsmen must be totally destroyed. Tom accidently on purpose
  kills a samuri and feels bad so he tries to make it up to the
  wife and son then he realizes a brutal beauty to the life of a
  samuri and joins them. It's very paint by the numbers story and
  acting, even the Japanese landscape is boring. Of course the U.S.
  Army is painted as bad guys when the whole blame for the mess and
  bloodshed that follows can be put squarely on the shoulders of
  the weak emperor who didn't have the guts to put things right
  with the samuri in the first place. Then Tommy has some kind of
  ephifany and decides to stay in Japan. Snore. This movie was too
  long, and with all the money spent on this movie it really could
  have been a 1/2 decent semi-historic story about the destruction
  of the samuri in Japan</Text>
  <Text category="health">I agreed with all the criticism that the
  Revlon eyelash curler (now discontinued) received. It broke
  quickly and used up batteries by the truckload. But the one thing
  it did well that the Carmen curler does poorly is to provide the
  type of construction and shape that keeps you from accidently
  squeezing pieces of eyelid skin. This instrument catches my skin
  very easily and it's hard to get good curled lashes without
  hurting my eyelids</Text>
  <Text category="health">It did what it was supposed to do, and my bras
  came out of the wash without any weird creases. However, some
  bras hold up better in the washing machine than others, and I
  think the one I put into the BraBABY was one of the more durable
  ones. While it does what it's supposed to, it definitely is not
  easy to use. I had difficulty putting a B-size cup in without
  squishing the bra. The clasp is also badly designed. If it
  breaks, it's not a big deal to tie the outer ball closed, but the
  whole thing is poorly engineered. I think it was made even harder
  seeing as how I tried using the BraBABY with a front-closing
  racer back. In the end, I think it would have been easier and
  just as effective to use a lingerie bag. I don't recommend this
  product</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">The first time I put this workout DVD on, I
  expected to see exercises designed for abs, buns and thighs. What
  I actually saw was an easier version of the kickboxing DVD. I
  kept going, thinking it would get to the abs, buns and thighs,
  but it never did! The other huge problem with this video is that
  half of it is filmed from the waist up, or headshots only, so
  when you are being introduced to a new step in the routine, you
  can't even learn it, because you cannot see the instructors legs
  or feet. Also very irritating how there are interruptions in
  filming, picking up on a different beat to where it left off. All
  in all an awful purchase and not even worth the $4.86 paid. I
  turned it off halfway through the second workout and put Billy
  Blanks TaeBo on instead. MUCH BETTER!!!</Text>

  <Text category="health">Tylenol is an over-the-counter medication that
  contains as its active ingredient "Acetaminophen". Acetaminophen
  is an analgesic drug that treats mild to moderate pain, making it
  a great headache reliever, or a medication that treats mild
  strains, sprains, toothaches, etc. It also acts to reduce fever.
  Acetaminophen is commonly used in place of aspirin for those
  allergic to aspirin. One drawback of Acetaminophen is that it
  does not reduce inflammation (therefore, it has limited use in
  arthritis swelling reduction). It has few side-effects. Those
  with liver disease should avoid Acetaminophen, as it is hard on
  the liver. Tylenol (Acetaminophen) came into great prominence
  when aspirin fell out of favor due to the incidence of Reye's
  Syndrome and aspirin in children. Tylenol is the manufacturer's
  proprietary name for Acetaminophen. There is a generic form of
  Acetaminophen that is also sold over the counter, and this
  version is much cheaper than "Tylenol", and the container usually
  contains more tablets/pills, etc. The generic form of
  Acetaminophen is just as effective as Tylenol, just cheaper
  priced. Sometimes Acetaminophen is combined with other
  medications for dual action. For example, Tylenol PM has
  diphenhydramine (the active ingredient in Benadryl), which causes
  sedation and acts like a good sleeping pill. Diphenhydramine also
  is an anti-histamine, so it work for itching and allergies too.
  Tylenol is packaged in different strengths: Extra-strength at 500
  mg per tablet, Standard (325 mg per tablet), and children's dose
  of 80 mg. Tylenol may also be packaged in a timed-release
  version, called "extended release". Rather than the tablet
  dissolving all at once in the stomach, the tablet slowly releases
  acetaminophen throughout the digestive tract. All in all,
  Acetaminophen is a great product. If you want a "name brand" of
  Acetaminophen, Tylenol is your brand (although it will cost
  more). My choice is to by the generic brand as it is cheaper by
  the dozen. Jim "Konedog" Koenig</Text>

  <Text category="music">Sarah Brightman is one of my all time favorite
  artists. But this disc is just a complete waste. It is missing so
  much, and has too many songs that don't belong. Like the phantom
  songs. As much as I love them, save them for the Andrew Llyod
  Webber collections. Can't we have a nice singles collection with
  just her solo works starting from "Dive"? Her "Classics" album
  had it right. Except their version of "Captain Nemo" was the rip
  off live version. And THIS cd doesn't even have the Captain Nemo
  song, which is a HUGE fan favorite, and definitly was a single.
  It is also missing How Can Heaven Love Me, Eden, Harem, and
  Beautiful. All singles as well. Save your money. Either buy the
  "Classics" album for a somewhat better compilation, or just make
  your own mix like I did. Because Sarah has so many wonderful
  songs (And quite a few bad ones I will admit) And it seems on
  here they give you some bad ones (like requium and nella
  fantasia), and leave out the good ones. "It's A Beautiful Day"
  and "What You Never Know" are good, but are the weakest songs
  form Harem. Why on earth would you leave out "Harem" and
  "Beautiful", but leave on Beautiful Day and WYNK? Whoever put
  this set list together must have not put much thought into it and
  is just trying to cash in. I bet Sarah didn't have much say in
  this compilation. This is just a waste. Beautiful album cover

  'Smugglers Blues'? Do you think he was writing from the

  songwriters and performers of the 80's. Enjoy the nostalgia, but

  <Text category="dvd">I love Speilberg films, I really do, but the
  fact that he is a good director is no excuse for this crap. I
  just do not like it, its not my thing. I can't belive that
  Richard Dreyfuss turned down reprising his role in Jaws 2 because
  he was filming this nonsense. If you want to watch it, then go
  ahead, we all have different tastes. However, if you want to see
  a real Speilberg film, watch ones like Duel, Jaws, ET,
  Schindler's list, Jurassic Park, The Lost World: Jurassic Park,

  <Text category="dvd">I am an Alice fan, so this is far far from my
  favorite. The first star I gave was simply because I love Kate
  Beckinsale and the movie isn't scary. The other is because It
  would be enchanting for a 3-4 year old or another youngster that
  doesn't know anything about Wonderland. My 9 year old even got
  bored with this. Kate Beackinsale plays the Mother in the
  beginning, and in 1999 she was much too young to be and
  definitely looked so. She just didn't look well in this movie,
  and everything looked so cheap and fake. The story was changed in
  all the wrong places and too much was left out. I would not
  recommend this. I would recommend the 1999 American mini series
  of Alice in Wonderland, it is my absolute favorite; with Martin
  Short as the Mad Hatter, and a long list of big names. That one
  is fun for all ages</Text>

  <Text category="toys_games">I ordered this for my son's up coming 1st
  birthday party. I figured he and his little friends can sit in
  there to play. I received the package this morning and I was in
  for a surprise. First of all, 50% of the balls (it came with 100
  balls) were half inflated. The shell of the balls are so soft,
  and somehow the air inside was not full enough; thus half of the
  ball looked crushed. Then, I thought, " fine, I just go buy
  another 100 balls to mix them in. no biggie". Then, I inflated
  the pit for my son to play in. No more than an hour later, the
  main part of the pit deflated by almost half and the plug was
  still securely attached. So, there must a hole somewhere. This
  toy is totally unsalvageable. I had to make a call to amazon and
  they have authorized the return of this product for a refund.
  This is a very low quality product. I didn't expect kiddie toy
  like this will last long, but one hour is too short for me. I
  don't think I will buy anything from this Ball Toyz company in
  the future either. I think their balls are too flimsy.</Text>
  <Text category="book">Reading this book ten years after it was

  <Text category="dvd">I was expecting to see a decent film by Bava,
  but after having seen about 5 of his films, I can only guess that
  is he is a very good stylist but he lacks the capability to
  engage us with a story or to even scare us. Most of his films are
  gorgeous to behold but they are vapid and have no story, this
  film is just like all the rest. There is no point to any of it,
  there is no plot and hardly any suspense, suffice it to say it
  might be interesting for a 12 year old horror goof but to an
  adult, its quite tedious. Chris Lee is rather banal also, he
  doesn't do much and it seems that he dubbed his own voice in the
  studio, most of the cast is rather dull also, supposedly playing
  some ancient noble family, they look more like 1960's mop heads
  and morons who were on too much acid. The dialogue, what there
  is, is crude, probably written by a drunk Italian because there
  are so many mistakes, one example was when Lee was whipping the
  lady on the beach and she says, "I can't have more ice cream!"
  So, I would suggest renting "Planet of the Vampires" because that
  is more enjoyable than this waste. Interesting character to note
  was "Lesmo", dubbed as the "European Peter Lorre" who doesn't
  have much in the way of presence or acting skills and he looks
  like a cross between a frog and a midget.</Text>

  <Text category="toys_games">This is a new low, even for our
  feminazi-drenched anti-culture. The whole message of this whore
  of a doll is to tell impressionable little girls that being
  superficial, arrogant, shallow and slutty are positive
  attributes, desirable &amp;amp; healthy, and that by contrast,
  having true strength of character, integrity, honor and modesty
  are for 'losers.' In other words, looking and behaving like a
  skank tramp = "empowerment." That term has been SO misued over
  the last 30 years (and particularly the last 10), that it ceases
  to have any truth to it whatsoever. Barbie used to epitomize what
  it meant to be feminine, a lady, and fulfilled -- with a husband,
  a home and children. Now that standard has been completely
  perverted and ruined with the onset of dolls like this --
  exchanging true values (being a good wife and mother) for false
  ones (materialism and promiscuity). Even Barbie's face has been
  uglified -- grossly overdone mascara/eyeliner and collagened-out
  lips -- resembling those hideous whored-out Bratz dolls. Realize
  -- this is a WAR on our children's souls! Mattel should be

  in the device (something I didn't realize when I bought it). 4.
  Not "cleaner than a mop." If you have a heavy-traffic floor like
  I do, you'd have to use about 3 clean pads on the floor to keep
  from pushing dirt around. A mop at least can be rinsed. 5. Bottle
  is impossible to refill. I might have stuck with it if I could
  have replaced the solution with a water/Mop &amp;amp; Glo mix,
  but they have the bottle fixed so you can't. *sigh* I'm actually

  The ES-1000 performed so poorly that I had to use my BMS that I

  <Text category="health">I was excited about this pool because it
  seemed really easy to store when not in use. However, the new
  type of valve does not hold in the air. It says to push it all
  the way in but the valve on the one I bought would not stay in
  and when I tried to close the valve the presure from the air
  inside pushed open the valve and it deflated. It would have been
  perfect had the valve worked properly.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Normally I am a big fan of the little tikes
  name, but not so with this product. I bought this for my 2 1/2
  year old daughter and although the concept is cute, it is not
  like other Little Tikes products. To begin with, the train
  frequently comes off the track. Also to activate it, you must
  press the button where the conductor goes. However, it is
  difficult for my daughter to place the figure on this spot
  without it falling off. She often presses the button in the
  process which activates the train while she is still trying to
  put the figure on it which frustrates her. Since this is geared
  for toddlers, you would think that Little Tikes would have put
  the button to activate the motion in a different spot from where
  the figures go. Also, at age 2 1/2 she is quickly bored with it.
  She has more fun letting it go on the floor across the room than
  riding on the track. Needless to say, it is going back. The only
  good feature is that you can "pack it and go" for away from home

  <Text category="dvd">I have watched this movie along with many
  other Jet Li films. To be very honest with you this movie is one
  that you can keep out of your collection. I was so caught up in
  the title that I really was expecting much more from the film.
  But I was very disappointed to say the least. The movie takes
  place in the early eighties. When Gangs dressed in leather with
  chains, carrying spray paint and break danced occasionally. This
  was not the type of movie that I was expecting Jet Li to be in.
  If you want some real action packed Jet Li pick up the Contract
  Killer which will give you alot more for your money TRUST ME you

  <Text category="book">When I discovered the existence of this novel,
  I was enthusiastic and intrigued. Unfortunately, my hopes were
  more or less dashed as I trundled my way through the 382 pages.
  KLEOPATRA focuses on the famous queen's early years - a period of
  time of which we have no record - and the intrigues that haunted
  and led to the demise of any semblance of a family (something she
  may have compensated for in adulthood). What I liked: 1). The
  spelling of Kleopatra/ Cleopatra with a "K"- it really does
  emphasize that Hellenistic connection; 2) Kleopatra's strength of
  character- Essex's general characterization is appropriate and
  it's easy to see what Kleopatra will become. Although the novel
  is a noble attempt by Karen Essex, it just didn't work for me.
  The character of Berenike as an Amazon seemed a bit far-fetched.
  And although I loved Kleopatra's love interest (I won't give away
  his name!), I felt it was a bit far-fetched as well, almost as if
  Essex was pressured into a love story from the publisher or
  something. Kleopatra's Dionysian rites were also a little hard to
  believe, as was Mohama. There were also scenes of random sex that
  were a bit... unnecessary. Overall, although Kleopatra was a
  strong, believable character, she was in the minority. The novel
  as a sort of back-story to the Queen of Egypt didn't work as it
  was weighed down by the elements of fiction! At least the sequel
  is better. For fiction that works, check out The Memoirs of
  Cleopatra by Margaret George.</Text>

  SLEPT WITH. I mean that is how you lose money on child support.
  Sex has never been the most important thing in life. Honestly
  though I mean you just can't see these guys rapping about these

  be interested in a group of rappers that in 10 years probably

  <Text category="book">Every once in a while I like to pick up a book
  that is outside the realm of usual reading, and look for a
  surprise, or spark to keep the fires of imagination from dying
  out - it is with this mindset I picked up "Wouldn't Take Nothing
  for My Journey Now." And what did I find as a result of my
  maverick literary exploration? Ehh... Ms. Angelou may not take
  anything for her journey, but based on the cover price she will
  take $17.00 to tell you a bit about it, and even this may not
  even seem like that bad a deal were it not for the fact that
  either her journey was bland, her insights wanting or her
  conclusions misguided - whatever the cause, this book is
  dreadful. If you are looking for the usual meaningless new age
  spiritual gobble-gook; i.e., about boundaries, respect, finding
  ones direction, learning what it means to be a women, etc. then
  this journey is for you - but if you see this nonsense as the
  nonsense it is, you will be best served my buckling up your shoes

  <Text category="dvd">Sure, this was heaped with loads and loads of
  popular acclaim by the critics, but the question you should be
  asking yourself is, will it appeal to the average person? The
  simple answer here is a loud and resounding NO. Here are the
  reasons: 1) Unless you're a well-bred blue blood who knows all
  about Edward II and loves Shakespeare, this is extremely hard to
  follow, not just because of the archaic olde English-speake, but
  also due to choppy production and editing which impedes the plot
  coherence. Result? If you're not lost you will soon will be, and
  worse yet, you won't care; 2) Don't be fooled by the lure of
  Annie Lennox-she is an itsy-bit of a bit player in the overall
  run of this "movie" and is, for all intents and purposes,
  inappropriately placed in the middle of it much like the effect
  of having an MTV commercial rammed in the middle of your
  programme; 3) Let's be clear about what you're getting for your
  10-15 dollars: It's not a movie at all, but an arty-pretentious
  stab at cheap play production with less cinematography than your
  average soap opera or home movie. Further, the "period" is
  thematically juxtiposed with costumes of old and new, making one
  more likely to ponder whether their budget was short, not what
  cutty-edgy-trendy-theme-within-a-theme are they trying to
  promote. Who knew such a tantillizing, heart-wrenching piece of
  history could be rendered so dull?</Text>
  <Text category="book">The setting of this book is beautiful, exotic,
  and interesting. The author, unfortunately, does nothing to take
  advantage of this. I am shocked that this book could possibly
  have won a National Book Award. It must mean that either the
  award itself is meaningless, or that there were some truly
  dreadful books out that year -- which I doubt. The topic of this
  book could have been more ably handled by just about anyone else,
  as far as I am concerned. I can't imagine it being done worse!
  Tuck's writing style -- short vignettes or episodes, one after
  another -- is terribly ineffective and disjointed. I felt
  completely detached from all of the characters. I didn't feel
  like I gained any understanding of who they were, and was unmoved
  when they died or otherwise encountered tragedies. Another thing
  that completely irritated me were Tuck's sexual references.
  Throughout the novel, Tuck would end her lame vignettes with one
  or two sentences mentioning some crass sexual encounter (a finger
  inserted in an unmentionable place or a character participating
  in a masturbating contest, for example). These sentences seem to
  be thrown in just to shock or perhaps to intrigue the reader; all
  they did was gross me out. They were written in such a way that
  they seemed to have been written by a teenage boy, not an adult
  woman trying to tell a compelling story. I don't know what Tuck
  was trying to do in this novel. I think she has failed to write
  anything that succeeds on any level: It is not entertaining. It
  is not profound. It is not educational. It is not beautiful. At
  only 248 pages, I can't say it was even a quick read. Utterly
  forgettable, once you get past the irritation of having wasted
  your time reading it.</Text>

  <Text category="toys_games">Twice I gave this board game as a gift this
  holiday season, and my own 5-year-old daughter received it as a
  gift. While the idea of the game seems good, there seems to be
  some misleading print on the box. It indicates that the prinesses
  will be getting ready to meet Prince Charming at the ball, but
  there is no Prince Charming included in the game pieces--much to
  the dismay of my daughter! My biggest complaint about this game,
  however, is with the gowns and accessories the princesses wear as
  they move about the board. The straps of the dresses are very
  thin, and my daughter has broken three of the four gowns. She has
  also broken two crowns and the strap on one purse. My daughter
  plays with the rubber Polly Pocket things as well, and she has
  not torn/ripped any of those items, which makes me think the
  Crowns and Gowns items aren't made as strongly</Text>
  <Text category="book">F this self-help industry crap.
  Quasi-astrological poppycock at its worst. I can tell this book

  remember, this "doctor," is quietly making mucho mucho bucks off
  your poor purchase. Your goddamned ancestors never needed a book

  <Text category="music">Jimi Hendrix was an ideal guitarist to lead a
  power trio, and he thrived in that format. He inspired other
  groups to attempt it, with varying degrees of success. But the
  Experience was a unit, able to soar on stage in extended live
  versions of Hendrix's compositions. Had it not been for the demon
  of discontent within the trio itself (that curses so many
  otherwise excellent bands), the Experience might have created
  several more inspired albums than it did before falling apart.
  The album BAND OF GYPSYS was jarring upon its release to those of
  us looking for Hendrix to continue to maximize the potential of
  the Experience. At the time, loosely associated groups that
  traded off lengthy lead parts in a more or less generic old-style
  blues format were common and certainly not original -- much less
  cutting edge. It's true that Jimi does some respectable work on
  this record against the backdrop of the blues grooves supplied
  for him, but there's an odd and unwelcome shift in the balance.
  Buddy Miles became a kind of intrusion into the world Jimi had
  fashioned in his previous work. On a Hendrix album, songs sung by
  Buddy Miles didn't move the bar; they did not elucidate Jimi's
  universe. Buddy's drum work was simply not in the style of Mitch
  Mitchell, and that was a large step down from the Experience's
  innovative grooves in songs like "Fire," for example. Listen to
  "Fire," and then listen to any cut on "Band of Gypsys." Listen to
  Hendrix's wild half-sung, half-wailed vocals on the previous
  albums, and then listen to Buddy Miles sing "Changes." You can't
  reconcile the two styles, and that would not be quite so bad if
  it weren't for the obvious fact that Band of Gypsys, under Buddy
  Miles' unfortunate influence, were not a step backward toward
  traditional blues rather than another reach into the future
  already painted by Jimi's previous work in tracks like "Are You
  Experienced?" and "Third Stone from the Sun." Jimi's guitar work
  put him several steps ahead of the blues in terms of making his
  instrument perform overdriven rock tone poems and distorted rock
  concertos on his behalf. Band of Gypsys turned Jimi backward into
  a lead player in a blues band, which one might even have mistaken
  as being headed up by sideman Buddy Miles. That's not what people
  bought a Hendrix album for. It just didn't work very well as a
  release from what people still considered the Hendrix Experience.
  Jimi seemed to have gone off track somehow, and the effect was to
  make him seem a little less what he had been up to that point. No
  doubt people got smoked up and enjoyed portions of the album that
  seemed like an intimate studio groove, but the cohesion of the
  Experience, the clear creative identity of the Hendrix Experience
  was not there. You can say it was as simple as the fact that we
  missed Noel Redding and Mitch Mitchell, and that may be true. But
  whatever the line-up, people were not entirely ready for Jimi to
  share his stage with any other would-be featured players.</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">The bar is nice, and I suppose the mat will

  it's just awful. The music is painfully bad. Seriously, what dp
  little girls dressed like fruit have to do with ballet? And the
  "host" is a confusing choice: her accent is distracting, and it's
  made even worse by the fact that she's talking around braces. The
  two little girls who help her don't look much happier. In fact,
  the one on the left looks like someone told her to smile or else.
  Trying to keep up with the nominally enducational DVD is harder
  than you might think, as the mat has two sides and you have to
  flip it over mid-stream, only you get no warning and no time to
  do it. And the positions are introduced too quickly and with no
  discussion; they're just lyrics to the annoying song. Our
  daughter got this for her 3rd birthday, and she actually looked
  at me the first time we watched it and said, "I want the fruit to
  go away." I had to laugh out loud and tell her I did too!
  Overall, I'm sorry her grandparents spent $15 on this. Total

  <Text category="book">This book is for readers with little or no
  knowledge of recent debates on energy security, global warming,
  etc. as well as related technological advances in fields such as
  hydrogen and fuel cells. The author contributes little to
  previous books on the subject, such as Rikin's book on hydrogen
  which is much better researched and just as accesible to the
  general public. If anything, the book's original contribution is
  to discuss how energy and environmental issues can be addressed
  using market mechanisms. In doing so, the author comes up with
  some interesting case studies, but it's quite obvious he is
  biased toward the same tired free-market ideology that is
  endlessly promoted in the pages of The Economist, which happens
  to be the author's employer. Moreover, there was little effort in
  integrating the various chapters. Overall, a very disapointing
  book. The author should stick to journalism</Text>

  I got this doll because my 3 and 5 year olds, both "had to have

  extent of the play with this doll. It isn't a doll that they can
  use imagination with, snuggle with, or any other type of
  constructive play. A Dora video would have been a better choice.
  At least their attention would have been captured for the 30
  minutes and then they would have watched it again later. In order
  to get the skirt to stay on (to change the song she danced to) I
  had to push VERY hard. My kids couldn't do it on their own</Text>

  <Text category="health">I purchased this humidifier, and it worked
  wonderfully with a soothing blue night light for my son for about
  a week. One night, it just stopped producing that humidifying
  mist and could not be coaxed into working again. I called the

  and they would be sending a new one to replace it (with no cost
  for shipping to me). I received the new one a week later, which
  to my disappointment, did not have the nightlight feature. I also
  noticed it was from a different brand company. I can't remember
  the name but it also began with the word "sun." So far, the new
  humidifier is working fine (about 2 weeks now), but it has a
  lower water capacity so I have to refill it every night (vs.
  every 2 nights with the original one) and the lack of the
  nightlight is a big disappointment. The process of replacing,
  however, was very smooth and also free so I'll give them 2 stars
  for that</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Who would give the green light to this? It is
  a total remake of the 1968 classic. The only difference is that
  there is a slight revamp to reflect modern times. Since it

  hsould be of it...it pales in comparison to the original. This
  was really weird to remake this movie. "Dawn of the Dead" was
  cool b/c it had a new, fresh spin to the story. This has no

  doesn't look at the correct camera when speaking to the audience

  <Text category="dvd">They spend the first half of this movie saying
  how great the Ultimate Warrior was. The journey is awesome! Then
  all of the sudden, the paid WWE guys just began to bad-mouth the
  Warrior. Maybe he did have questionable judgment - but why are
  they trying to make us feel bad about someone we loved? They take
  some very low blows. They say that the Warrior was a bad
  wrestler. Actually he seemed just fine to me when I was young,
  and I really can't distinguish one's ability from the other. They
  just all gang up on him and make outragious allegations. Vince
  says quickly that the reason why the Ultimate disappeared for 3
  years was because he failed a drug test. As soon as he says this,
  they fade to black then come back with a new issue. What drug
  use? Which drugs? Presumably they're talking about steroids. But
  what about that high and mighty Hulk Hogan with his admitted drug
  use. Let's not talk about that - let's just keep ganging up on
  the Warrior. They completely ridicule him changing his name to
  the Warrior. And they also just try to badmouth him so much. Who
  cares that none of the wrestlers liked him? I don't! He excited
  the heck out of me way more than any of the dorks who say bad
  things about him -including Hulk. And oh yeah - they don't even
  let the Warrior defend himself. Why did I have to find out from
  IMDB.com that he was asked to appear but declined? Why don't they
  address this? This "docu" is more slanted than "Fahrenheitt 911"
  Every wrestling and Ultimate Warrior fan will start out loving
  this docu then hating it. It just leaves you with a bitter taste

  lamp after doing a bit of research. After taking the very heavy
  lamp out of the box and assembling it, I turned it on to find
  that it gives off very little light. I thought it might be
  something I would need to get used to and sat down that night to
  read only to find that my eyes were straining under the light. I
  tried using the lamp during the day/twilight and found that the
  illumination of the lamp was barely noticable. Though it was
  quite a feat to put the lamp back into the box it was shipped in,
  I returned it to Amazon which is something I rarely do</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">there's nothing you can tell clearly about
  this movie, because from the very beginning to the end, i've just
  heard lota f words; f....this, f....that, typical stupid
  stereotyped mafia talks. and i swear to god when i watched this
  pathetic movie and thought that if mafia could be this stupid,
  and if they could just use that fxxx word in every sentence they
  talked, and if they thought that by using this fxxx word once
  they open their mouth to talk and used this f word to show their
  smartness and toughness, or if they thought by simply using this
  big F word and they could kill thy kingdom come, then america
  might not look like what we're seeing now. maybe the mafia could
  just use this big word to kill all the terrorists in the world,
  maybe they could just use it to solve all the problems and guess
  what? they're just using that word to kill each other. or is this
  just what hollywood think that all the mafia mob guys could walk
  the walk easier by simply using this big F word to talk the talk?

  Dude spits some retarded a** lyrics. I give this CD a two cuz of

  <Text category="book">I'd never read Berry before, but as far as I
  can tell, this brief collection of six essays and lectures sticks
  to familiar territory. However, it's probably not the best entry
  point for people who are newcomers to his realm. There are two
  related problems with the book: one of presentation, and one of
  tone. The problem with presentation is that the pieces are so
  short that there's no room for specifics. So, while one might be
  more or less in accord with the broad strokes of Berry's vision,
  there's no detail to back it all up. The problem with tone is
  that from the very first page the reader feels like they are
  being lectured at. Of course, some of the pieces are lectures,
  but there's a certain condescension that runs throughout the
  book. It comes out when Berry uses certain words such as the
  three As of "appropriate", "authentic" and "adequate". When these
  are used ( as they often are), there he's obviously made some
  kind of value judgment, but the reader is never let in on it. The
  end result of the two flaws is that the reader feels like a
  hectoring argument is being made without any supporting logic --
  which ultimately smacks of preaching to the choir. Which is
  unfortunate, since I tend to agree with Berry on a lot of things
  (though not his anti-abortion stance). Small farms are good,
  agribusiness is bad, stewardship of the land is good, extraction
  industries are bad, treating the body as an organic whole is
  good, and things of that nature. Alas, he has a tendency of
  making sweeping assertions and accusations that are far too
  simplistic and shrill to be useful. Two examples from the first
  15 pages will suffice to illustrate: "This is a world in which
  the cultures that preserve nature and rural life will simply be
  disallowed." and "Communists and capitalists are alike in their
  contempt for country people, country life, and country places."
  Berry also succumbs to the trick of creating straw men to counter
  his theses. For example, in one essay, he claims that
  conservationists are people who want to simply preserve land in a
  pristine, untouched state, and that's all. While there are
  certainly some conservationists who feel that way, they are a
  small minority of a a much larger community who actually is in
  almost total accord with Berry's views on stewardship and land
  use. It certainly doesn't help matters that his view of
  small-scale farming appears to be heavily tinted with
  rose-colored glasses. His claims that modern agribusinesses has
  rendered the small farm economically unviable sounds like a
  reasonable proposition. However, it ignores the fact that,
  historically, small scale farming ran on the thinnest of margins,
  was subject to all kind of external instability (weather, vermin,
  etc.), and operated on only slightly better than a subsistence
  level. In farming, cash is scarce, that's why people abandoned it
  in droves whenever the opportunity presented itself, such as in
  WWII, when all those defense-industry factories were opened in
  California. (Of course, in Berry's vision, you don't really need
  cash, because you barter for everything you need from your
  neighbors.) Berry's exhortations to create small-scale
  communities is worthy stuff, and even in cities people are
  creating this. The growth of CSAs, farmers markets, and the like
  in the past decade is a tangible indicator of this. However, to
  achieve the large scale results Berry seeks requires a more
  rigorous roadmap than what is provided in this slim
  collection</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I was hoping that Miller would turn his
  talents from the dark side and we would see how well he could
  reproduce a Classical Epic. What we get is a blood splattered
  "300 Lacedaimons in the Hood". The Spartans are presented to be a
  buch of Homo erotic Rastafarians. The Persians rather than the
  Noble Middle Eastern Autocrats presented in their Art are drawn
  by Miller to resemble African American Gangstas with piercings
  and Skin art everywhere. I was looking for Xerxes to have a grill
  and whitewalls on his chariot. If you were into "Sin City", you
  will love this mishmashed version of the Classical Tale of
  bravery and sacrifice in the face of overwhelming odds</Text>
  <Text category="music">I am at a loss to hear what people appreciate
  about this CD. We were barely able to make it through one
  listening. This is a classic example of a CD that NEVER would
  have been produced had the artist (using the term very loosely)

  talent and originality on this CD is apalling. It only gets a
  star because that's the lowest rating. I want my money

  <Text category="music">Cheap Trick's second album is very
  disappointing to me after the good, but raw, "Live In The
  Studio", 1977-76 recorded Cheap Trick. Almost all of the material
  here is so watered down that it REALLY COMES OFF WAY BETTER on
  the later many Live disks they did. After a good start w/ "Hello
  There", a concert favorite for many years, is the only thing here
  to write home about when one considers how great all the tunes
  from this overproduced album sounded on the Budokan and other
  Live recordings later. Tom Werman and Rick Niesen were on a show
  in 1991 that I had recorded on a tape once and Werman, noce a
  friend of Tom Petersson's said, quote: "My three albums with
  Cheap Trick got better and better...", to which the ever
  sarcastic Rick Nielsen said, "Selling, maybe." Not realizing that
  brother Rick was slamming him, Werman then continued,
  "Exactly"... Oh boy. We now see why producing Cheap Trick albums
  through the years has become like playing Russian Roulette. It's
  not hard to get better than this and five months later the solid,
  but somewhat oeverrated 'Heaven Tonight' came out...(And the guys
  EVEN bought Werman back for Dream Police. Things turned out
  better when Pete Comita, then later Jon Brant joined the band.
  Yep - the best was yet to come - in the '80'</Text>

  tries to put her feet in the position and kicks off the music
  pads. Only 2 instructions - feet up, feet down. On the other arms

  <Text category="toys_games">These figures look pretty decent at first
  glance but when you take them out of the box you see how bad they
  really are. My superman broke in half (at the waist) when I took
  him out of the box! Add that to the fact that there are only an
  average of six points of articulation on each (only three on
  Wonder Woman!) and you see that these aren't very high quality
  figures. Amazo is transparent, which makes no sense whatsoever.
  He isn't an invisible character. I also don't like that, while
  superman's S and belt stick out from his uniform, Bizarro's are
  merely painted on. Only buy this item if you love doomsday and

  <Text category="music">can it be that people are letting their

  which ones we love, because we all know what bob dylan's worst
  record was, and its saved. im not one to question this man's

  in the universe, but could it be that bob dylan made a transfer

  <Text category="book">I haven't done this in awhile, but I don't
  think I could review this piece any better than the other reviews
  I've read about it. It's pretty average, however filled with nice
  bits of knowledge. They didn't seem well-researched in some
  areas. Here are the interesting parts of reviews from the other
  "critics" that I agree with... "they go into lengthy history
  lessons about the origins of the characters when two
  sentences...would be enough." - John Gallant "Biased against
  superheros(sic)" - Christopher Ritter "I found this book to be
  tedious, lacking in charm, badly researched and wildy inaccurate
  in some areas." - C.P. Halliday "I picked up this book." -
  Lawrance M. Bernabo "Their belief seems to be that Donald Duck
  was the best comic book ever..." - M.G. Bloedorn "Pretty boring."
  - BernardZ "...a black hole is hypothesized, lending a faint
  respectability to the premise behind Green Lantern's abilities."
  - Peter Vinton Jr. "...this book will not satisfy full on
  fans..." - James N. Simpson &amp;amp;lt;---gave it five stars. "a
  chance to laugh about the heroes I still love and that mean so
  much to me." - Reviewer "Man, there's a whole 200 pages of this
  pooh-poohing, cranky-old-maid kind of stuff!" - Mark Alfred "They
  were even putting words into C. Darwin's mouth." - Aaron Spriggs
  "Mildly entertaining but not great" - Reviewer "When the man
  (Dean Koontz in this case) writing the introduction says he
  doesn't read comics, I began to get worried." - Ivan A. Wolfe "I
  agree with an earlier poster." - Reviewer "Almost every chapter
  tells you why the superhero is impossible." Plastic Larry "the
  authors give us a more plausible (given what we know now) origin
  for the Hulk, involving steroids and fluorescent gene
  modification." - J. Draper Carlson "this book is not mean
  spirited or nasty." Reviewer "Superman's powers break the laws of
  science. Ooh. Stop the presses." - [...] "interesting." - Rick
  Hunter "The Science of Superheroes," - Reviewer</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">The Little Rascals collection is a set of 5
  DVDs with a few shorts on each DVD, the fifth disk with an extra
  from the 50s and a documentary about child stars. This set was
  poorly put together, the shorts included are quite random, and
  buying this set would be a waste of money. Each disk opens with a
  montage of some of the characters. First there is Alfalfa, then
  Buckwheat, Spanky, Darla, Porky, Mickey, Stymie, then Fatty- oh
  wait, no that is Joe Cobb only they didn't know his real name,
  then Farina, and last Phil MacMahon- WHO you may be asking? Phil
  MacMahon, the kid who got bitten by the love bug in a song number
  in Our Gang Follies of 1938. Still don't know him? Maybe that is
  because he wasn't a regular cast member and should never have
  been featured like he was in this collection. Disk One features
  the shorts Dogs of War and Derby Day. Dogs of War is a silent
  film featuring the gang running loose on the Hal Roach lot; it is
  one of my favorite shorts from the series. However, it seems that
  they ripped off the Cabin Fever print and added a worse score.
  Derby Day also seems to be lifted from the Cabin Fever series. It
  is a silent film about the gang visiting the horse races. The
  films themselves are very good. Disk Two features a rarer silent
  film called Stage Fright. It is a film about a show put on about
  Marc Anthony by the kids in front of their parents. It is a total
  disaster. Just like in Reunion in Rhythm, one kid wants to go out
  on stage and recite poetry. The film has been seriously cut;
  there are no opening credits and the short is much shorter than
  the usual film length. The print is washed out and new title
  cards have been inserted. The music is much more childish than
  normal silent Rascals scores, but it works. There are sound
  effects too. Sundown Limited is a great short about the gang
  building their own train. It is a very cute film; Farina is
  especially funny in it. The train that the kids build would have
  been the envy of all the children in the neighborhood. The print
  is washed out and the music sounds just like Grapevine Video's
  soundtracks. The film titled The Pirates in this set is really
  called The Buccaneers. It is also a cute film about the kids
  trying to build their own ship. When it sinks, they find a real
  one to destroy. This short has also been cut; there is no opener
  for it either. It is a bad print and has kiddie music attached to
  it. Disk Three opens with Mary Queen of Tots. It is a really
  enjoyable film where Mary receives toys that look like the gang.
  She dreams they come to life, and when she wakes up, she finds
  the gang and believes they are her dolls come to life. This print
  is really bad especially considering there is a better print
  available on another cheaply made DVD set. It is funny that the
  music is the same on this set as on that one though. The Fourth
  Alarm is a film about the kids becoming junior fire fighters. The
  print on this one is not bad at all. The last film is School's
  Out, a talkie featuring a different cast. It is a film featuring
  Miss Crabtree, the new teacher. The picture is good; it seems to
  be the one from Cabin Fever. Disk Four begins with Bear Shooters.
  This is a less than great film. The print is great; it is the one
  from Cabin Fever. Our Gang Follies of 1938 is a great film, very
  funny, long, and exciting. It features the later talkie cast.
  Waldo's Last Stand is a film from the later MGM years, a lesser
  film that seems forced. It was also released in a 5 part Rascals
  set. Disk Five is the extra features DVD. It starts out with a
  segment from the You Asked For It television show. On it, some of
  the silent gang are reunited. Joe Cobb, Jackie Condon, Farina
  Hoskins, Johnny Downs, and Mickey Daniels are featured. The
  documentary called Kid Stuff really doesn't have a whole lot of
  information about the gang although Jackie Cooper is mentioned
  and Butch Bond does an interview. Other child stars like Jackie
  Coogan, Judy Garland, Shirley Temple, Roddy McDowall, and Ron
  Howard are focused on as well. The films in this collection are
  films that have lapsed into the public domain. Many of them have
  been available cheaply for years. The only reason a fan might
  want to see this collection, the same reason I bothered, was to
  see the rarer silent films. However, the rest of the set is
  trash</Text>
  <Text category="book">I bought this book this weekend as we're doing
  the pre-five in a Row w/our preschooler and I don't much like it.
  I've got a mother w/borderline personality disorder and who
  doesn't observe personal boundaries of other's what-so-ever (if I
  need a break away, she hunts down my poor husband, all my
  relatives and friends- ugh) and so this book just kind of made my
  stomach turn as I could see her reading this to me and justifying
  her 'stalker mom' mentality. In the end, I think if a person is
  from a semi-normal household w/proper respect for a child's
  boundaries and need for space away from their parents, then this
  book is okay. I just find some moms are too smoothering- even
  ones w/o personality disorders- and this book doesn't send a
  message about love as much as 'I own you'. I like 'Mama Do You
  Love Me?' better for explaining to a child a parent's
  unconditional love. 'Good-Night Moon' by Margaret Wise Brown,
  however, is by far my children's all time favorite book. I was
  reading that one to them ineutero and still every night before
  they go to bed. They love it and so do we as parents. But this
  one even creeped my hubby out and he's from a fairly 'normal'
  family. Take it w/a grain of salt</Text>
  <Text category="music">Diana Krall's popularity is not hard to
  understand, she's easy on the eyes and possesses a fine voice -
  rich, round, and polished. But that's where the good news ends.
  The selection of material and the narcoleptic
  Bossa-Nova-on-the-rocks arrangements combine to create a CD that
  is nothing less than a love song to Darvon, in fact, inside
  industry sources maintain that the entire CD was recorded in the
  frozen food section of a supermarket late at night in order to
  eliminate the middle man. The rule with standards is, don't do
  them unless you can bring something fresh to the fair. Ms. Krall
  beats these exhausted warhorses mercilessly; cruel and unusual
  punishment considering it's a wonder they're still standing. The
  resuscitation of Popsicle Toes is both the final insult and
  injury, for blissful years this sliver of saccharine twaddle
  resided in richly deserved obscurity; how could she do this to
  us? Wherever there are hotel lobbies occupied by mildly
  inebriated people who aren't listening to each other, much less
  the ambient audio wallpaper, there will be a demand for music of
  this type. The Diana Kralls of the world can always find work
  because for many - smooth equals good. Walk, don't Krall. Beyond
  this woozy, soft-focused world there is music that is real, and
  really matters.</Text>

  is too fast on almost all the songs for the screamo sound, and
  hearing random voices and sounds of them in the studio between
  recordings just makes the album drag. although they've goten much
  tighter as a band and aren't as sloppy as they used to be, (they

  Not only was i disapointed with how it physically looked (colors

  called the tractor a negative name, stupid I believe it was, that
  it was going back. I wouldn't want my child having a toy that
  calls others names, so I wont give it to anyone either. Not to

  starter. As I got deeper into XML I found several
  mistakes/deficiencies in the book, and sometimes the author just
  flat out seemed to not know what he was talking about. For
  instance, the claim on page 86 that (#CDATA) is a valid DTD
  element content definition is flat out wrong. His description of
  Schema element declarations (pp. 114-115) teaches that using
  globals/refs is the only way to define complex elements, and is
  inappropriate for his example. He makes no mention of globals at
  all, leaving the reader confused. I have ceased to trust this

  <Text category="health">Razor blades are expensive enough as it is,
  and the trend of "more is better" has reached almost ludicrous
  points in the industry. What's that? Five blades, you say? Why,
  it must be better than four! Meh. I have fine stubble which grows
  in at varying angles across my neck. The good news is that, while
  other razors have always been unable to remove all of my stubble
  on the first try, this blade does, in fact, take care of the
  problem. In addition to this, it aggravated the skin quite a bit
  (this might have as much to do with the vibrating action as with
  the five blades). The precious soothing-aloe strip had little to
  no effect on my skin (particularly in the neck area). If you have
  sensitive skin at all, this might not be the razor for you.
  Contrary to the experience of others, however, the extra
  "trimming" blade worked well for me when getting the spots along
  the edge of my mouth, under my nose, and when shaping my vast
  hedge-like sideburns. However, the five blades on the other side
  dulled remarkably fast. Considering my rather fine hairs, I'm
  used to exchanging blades once every week or so. Now I'm
  exchanging them twice a week. Seeing as how this product is
  already so much more expensive than competitors' products, and
  seeing as how it is designed to work exclusively with the Fusion
  razor (and vice versa), and seeing as how its lavish wealth of
  cutting action has clawed at my skin, I find it hard to
  recommend</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">As I stated before, I have a fabulous thing
  called "Digital Cable". One night I was flippin through the
  channels and this movie was on. I could only watch so much of it
  before I had to turn it off because the voice dubbing was way
  off. Sometimes that happens with "Digital Cable", but it usually
  it will right itself in the end. As I watched for about a half an
  hour I could not take it anymore. I tried everything to fix it
  including switching channels, turning on and off the TV, and
  things of that nature. I even went as far as calling Comcast and
  complaining, but even that was a wasted effort. I eventually had
  to turn it off because I was a hairs-width away from haymakering
  Morris. Well, even though Comcast ruined my viewing experience so
  far, when I was at Blockbuster I decided to give it another
  chance. I know I mentioned that the lead actor could not act but
  I thought I could look past this, because it might not be
  completely his fault. For one the visuals could be slightly off
  like the voices, or it might be because it's his first movie. Who
  knows but Howard's mind was made up. "Rumble in the Bronx" was to
  be rented. From what I saw so far on "Digital Cable", I possibly
  found a person I could call my mentor, when I enter the world of
  stuntmen. When I returned home I threw the DVD in the DVD Player
  and guess what? The DVD was messed up as well, the voice dubbing
  was totally off key as it was on "Digital Cable". I raced back to
  Blockbusters and returned it and grabbed another copy, telling
  them this DVD was broken. I returned home again and tried to
  watch it. "WHAT THE HECK!?" I yelled, "IS THE WORLD AGAINST
  HOWARD TUTTLEMAN!?" You guessed it that DVD was messed up as too.
  I even tried it out on another DVD Player and it proved to me
  that the run of DVDs Blockbuster has were all messed up. I got so
  frustrated that I threw the DVD out the window (I rented it on my
  father's card so there is no recourse to me). After I cooled down
  alittle bit by blasting away on my harmonica, I was still
  determined to see this movie. I ran up to Best Buy in Troy, and I
  found a copy. I asked the servant that was working in the movie
  section if this is the most updated and newest version, hoping
  that it was a new pressing. I was happy with his answer and
  purchased it. Well I returned home and made up some popcorn and
  grabbed a pop. I put the DVD in the DVD Player and dimmed the
  lights. Finally, Tuttleman will have his moment. Well to keep
  this clean and short, let me say that, that night ended with a
  baseball bat, three (3) stitches in my hand, a broken window, and
  a hefty grounding-sentence(we are talking WEEKS here). In
  Conclusion, some movies can't be good, no matter how cool the
  stuntman, this movie should be pulled off the shelves because it
  could possibly start a riot. Later.</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">Is Larry an actual redneck, or is it all
  really a joke inside "Larry's" mind? I sometimes think that Dan
  Whitney (Larry's real name) knows what he's doing. I think he is
  actually making a huge joke out of the rednecks who are totally
  in love with him. He is openly mocking them, and when they might
  get a tad uncomfortable, but then he'll drop a politically
  incorrect joke into the routine, and they love him again.
  Dan/Larry started out as a "normal" comedian (there's footage of
  him on youtube before his Larry incarnation), and wasn't really
  getting anywhere with that. So he became a redneck, and is a
  multi-millionare now. But all his redneck fans think of Larry as
  a "regular guy", despite the fact that Larry lives in one of
  those fancy houses that rednecks think only NYCers live in (for
  the record, NYCers don't all live in fancy houses. There's a lot
  of working class people in NYC who live in regular houses and
  regular apartments). So Larry is taking advantage of illiterate,
  easily amused rednecks. Just put on a flannel shirt, fart, wear a
  Confederate flag, and say you hate liberals, then fleece the
  rednecks! I don't think Larry really has a redneck mentality
  (even though he's originally from Nebraska, so he has some
  hillbilly cred, so to speak). I think he's just making a ton of
  money off of easily amused people.</Text>

  <Text category="toys_games">I had searched high and low via the internet
  trying to find the perfect baby doll pram. Good quality material,
  well made and if possible fold away storage ability. When I found
  the Corolle Pram /Carriage I thought I found it plus the added
  bonus of a adjustable handle so no matter how tall my grand
  daughter was she could push her babies. But when it arrived I was
  not thrilled. What looked good on paper was not so in life. True
  it folds away to store in a closet no problem. But this ability
  is to easy and I fear the child will pinch her fingers. All that
  keeps the stroller in an up right position in 2 lame flip over
  metal rings. Now with the wonderful way a simple umbrella
  stroller for a real baby folds way, why wasn't this technology
  used on this product. Sure an adult would have to fold it up, but
  I would feel better if that was the case then a 4 year old maybe
  getting broken fingers. Also the cute canopy. It does not stay on
  if you even move it to open a tiny bit. I spent $113.00 on this
  item thinking I was getting a well put together item that would
  last years for my grand daughter. Only way that will happen is if
  I can weld parts together and forget about ever wanting to store
  it. I did not buy this from Amazon only cause I wanted it right
  away and so bought it from another shop. But I knew Amazon would
  have this forum and wanted to make sure others did not waste
  their money on this product. Go with the other one for $33 at
  least maybe it will stay together. Now I have to hope I can
  return this thing to where I bought it. But I think Corolle
  should either rethink this items design or just pull it from the
  stores. It's not what a good parent would want for their child.

  <Text category="dvd">So I decided maybe I'll give this exploitation
  thing a try considering I love gore,violence, and horror movies.
  The reason I give it a 1 star is because it just isn't that good
  of a movie. It's VERY boring for most of the movie. About the
  first 20 or so minutes few words are even said. Then the guys
  just rape this woman several times, then she comes back for a
  very unsatisfying revenge. It's very slow paced and doesn't live
  up to the hype. It isn't all that gory, and it isn't scary
  either. Also, the rape isn't that convincing. I'm not saying I
  need everything shown in detail, but the acting is so bad it
  makes it seem as if its not even a big deal. Oh, and the woman
  gets revenge on one of the men who raped her...and he was
  practically mentally retarded. The guy really just fell in with
  the wrong crowd and they convinced him to do something bad. That
  is not grounds for what she did to him, which in my opinion was
  the worst of the killings. Anyways. not that good of a movie,
  don't let the lure of sleaze and violence make you think it will
  be worth your time because its not</Text>
  <Text category="music">I am very disappointed in this CD. Not because
  the music isn't good, because it is. But because it is just not
  the Pat Green that used to play in Stillwater. The passionate,
  soulful Pat Green. Back then he sang about things that he
  believed in and loved. Now he is singing what Nashville tells him
  to. And this coming from the guy who sang "Nashville Sucks" with
  Cory Morrow. There are a ton of country singers out there that
  could have released this CD and it would have sounded exactly the
  same. But songs like "Southbound 35" and "Three Day" can only be
  sang by Pat Green. He needs to revisit his roots and come back to
  the red dirt country music that he was born to play. Will the
  real Pat Green please stand up</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">We bought this gadget for our 2-year old. To
  risk sounding like a broken record--or faulty spinning plastic
  toy, in this case--I'll just add my vote to the design flaws: 1.
  Volume. Not only is the volume loud, it's unbearably so. Even my
  daughter grabs her ears when she's playing on it. The voice is a
  bit garbled as well, so when the command 'Ready..Spin!' sounds
  more like 'Wordy...SPEW!' I prefer to spare my daughter's hearing
  loss for live concerts in her teenage years, so I've disabled the
  on/off switch. 2. Spin quality. A Sit n' Spin should have a
  fluid, effortless motion (like a lazy susan). This toy requires
  enormous effort to turn. To add to my daughter's frustation, the
  handle's base gives a bit (even with screws tightly fastened),
  making for a tedious experience rather than the joy ride we loved
  as kids. Spare the expense and the frustration of fitting this
  thing in the garbage can on collection day--buy an easel and
  finger paint kit instead.</Text>

  <Text category="book">I finished it because a friend recommended it,
  but had she not, I would have quit after page 20. I wasn't
  interested in the story or writing. I didn't find the story
  grotesque; I've read a lot worse dealing with the various topics
  in this book, but I just didn't find the protagonist very
  interesting. He went a bit nutty at the end and it is
  understandable given the situation. We learn about why he had to
  stick so tenaciously to his religious beliefs, to redeem himself.
  His actions didn't seem out of line, either during the war or
  during the plague, given his dire predicament and previous
  behaviors and experiences. I know this is a great example of a
  book written in second person, and perhaps for that it is worth
  reading. I wouldn't pick it up for enjoyment or leisure</Text>
  <Text category="music">First, here are some general positives about
  Jaci Velasquez: - She is a very gifted singer. Her vocal range is
  top-notch - definitely on par with Mariah Carey and Christina
  Aguilera. - She is beautiful. And unlike a previous reviewer, I
  do not consider the recognition of this attribute to be a sign of
  shallowness but rather a display of appreciation for feminine
  beauty. I like beautiful singing voices. I like beautiful women.
  There's no difference. - She has great spiritual depth. Her music
  reflects key spiritual themes such as love, faith and joy. Now,
  here's a critique of the CD: I listened to all the music samples
  (as you can do as well) and only one song caught my attention -
  "Lay It Down". The other tracks have too much of a hard rock
  sound and were too experimental for my taste. But the song "Lay
  It Down" was different. It sounded more acoustic, more in the
  style of folk rock - a genre that reflects my personal preference
  in pop music. I found the sound clip of "Lay It Down" to be
  intriguing because it reminded me of a hit song in the 1970's -
  Eric Carmen's "All By Myself", later covered by Celine Dion in
  1996. "All By Myself" is a ballad having a soft, understated
  introductory verse with an explosive chorus. The sample clip of
  "Lay It Down" appears to be in the same mold. It has a soft,
  understated introductory verse; however, it seems to lack an
  explosive chorus. Listen to the sample and hear it for yourself.
  The introductory verse is closing with the following lyrics: "All
  of my hopes and my dreams and my best laid plans Are slowly
  slipping through my folded hands" So far, so good. There's only a
  piano and a violin accompanying Jaci's soft vocals. Next, the
  song appears to be moving from the verse to the chorus and you
  hear the following lyrics: "So I'm gonna lay it down I'm gonna
  learn to trust You now" Now here's a problem. I am expecting to
  hear the beginning of an emotional outburst - an opportunity for
  a singer with the pipes of Jaci Velasquez to showcase her voice.
  But it is not forthcoming. Why? This intrigued me and I wanted to
  hear the whole song but I did not want to purchase a CD for only
  one song. Luckily, I discovered that a compilation CD of Jaci
  Velasquez's best songs was released recently and it contained
  "Lay It Down". Great! I bought the CD - "On My Knees: The Best of
  Jaci Velasquez". This is what I discovered after listening to
  "Lay It Down". - The first time through the verse and the chorus,
  the song is definitely understated. We simply have the
  accompaninment of a piano and a violin with Jaci's soft vocals. -
  The second time through the verse and the chorus, a drum beat is
  introduced and Jaci begins to let some emotion out beginning in
  the middle of the verse and when the song moves into the chorus a
  complete emotional outburst occurs. But somewhat to my dismay,
  this is not the same voice that I am expecting from Jaci
  Velasquez. Her voice was more raspy and raw (actually, it was
  sounding more like Demi Moore or Tara Reid, not that that is
  necessarily bad). Furthermore, she appeared to be struggling. Is
  this the same voice that was soaring effortlessly through the
  stratosphere on songs such as "On My Knees", "Speak For Me", and
  "Adore"? Is Jaci Velasquez losing her voice? I don't know but I
  find it very difficult to imagine that a young woman in her
  mid-20's is losing her voice. She is entering her prime. Barring
  a health issue, this just doesn't happen. "Lay It Down" is
  actually a pretty good song. In fact, I am almost of the opinion
  that it may be her best. I certainly find myself listening to
  this song more than any of her others. "Lay It Down" has the same
  message as the Beatles' classic "Let It Be". The words are
  different but both songs share the same sentiment. Actually, now
  that I think of it...they do share a couple of words in
  common...the words "let it be". Here are the closing lyrics: "I'm
  gonna let it be, I'm gonna let it go I'm gonna lay it down" The
  essential lesson being conveyed is learning to "let go and let
  God" - a profound spiritual insight. Something that each of us
  here is learning. This song is heartfelt and gut-wrenching. And
  though her voice is struggling through it, the song,
  nevertheless, works out its magic. I gave this CD 2 stars because
  I think Jaci Velasquez is attempting to redefine her music style
  and has not succeeded. Interestingly enough, her best sound was
  her first CD - Un Lugar Celestial (A Heavenly Place). Bring back
  the spanish/flamenco guitar and develop a more acoustic sound. In
  my opinion, the acoustic sound is more spiritual. Keep the piano
  and electric bass guitar but dispense with the hard rock electric
  guitar and synthesized sound effects. Develop a Latin folk rock
  sound with an element of jazz. Hire a good saxophonist or a
  trumpet player. Emphasize ballads. That should do the
  trick</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">This is the first movie I have seen whose
  rating slipped further the longer it played. "Eight Women" is the
  story of, well, eight women, who are trapped by a snowstorm --
  all 5 inches of it. The man of the house has been murdered in the
  night. Young and old, black and white, of different classes, the
  women must try to determine who the killer is. "Eight Women" is
  also a movie about secrets, of which everyone seems to have
  several. The plot has more twists and turns than an Alpine road
  on the Tour de France. Yet the first 2/3 of the film is
  tolerable, funny and even a bit interesting. The characters are
  self-interested and fun. There's dotty old grandma, a prissy,
  hysterical virgin aunt, the dead man's vampish sister and coltish
  young maid, two daughters, a somber yet elegant wife (Catherine
  Deneuve) and a black cook. Plenty of class and age tension to
  make three movies. Did I mention the music? Every twenty minutes
  or so, one of the characters breaks into song. These are always
  those stereotypical French songs -- full of longing and sadness
  and references to sleep and springtime -- that are tedious to
  American ears. And bizarre. While one character sings, the rest
  do slow little dances. Strange. By the 2/3 mark, I was going to
  give this quirky film 4 stars. But soon, the plot line spun out
  of control, getting more and more manic until it finally derailed
  completely with a tragic ending. Definitely not recommended
  unless you are desperate need of a bizarre experience.</Text>

  tries hard to invent new "teen speak" with tons of lame catch
  phrases that unfortunately caught on with some unpopular kids who
  liked the movie so much, they tried to sound like the shallow
  empty headed spoiled main characters even though most of the
  movie's fans live the life nowhere close to cher's and look
  nothing like her but they want to pretend. The movie hits you
  with these lame catch phrases every 15 seconds, desprate to beat
  you over the head with them. In the movie, the main character,
  Cher thinks she is too good for the boys in her high school but
  then she ends up with someone who is pratically a relative to
  her. Nasty! She is really arrogant for someone whose realtionship
  should be jerry springer. She's supposed to be a posh valley girl

  makes you think that with such a high rating, everybody should
  love this album and this is not the thruth. Not everybody like
  this king of musical experimentation, some do but some don't...I
  like Oxygene and Equinoxe, and even after all those years, they
  are still good to listen too. Rendez vous offers some really good
  moments, but we are far from the perfection as Oxygene or
  Equinoxe. Rendez-vous is easier to get use to that Zoolook is,
  but we are far from a near perfect album. That's all</Text>
  <Text category="book">I typically do not read stories like this, but
  a neighbor had lent it to me and I figured I'd check it out. The
  plot isn't bad, but the dialogue is another story. The writing
  was so unbelievably awful that I had to fight myself to finish
  it. Phrases like "God damn, Oh god, etc..." were repeated over
  and over again. I got really sick hearing about Tess's cute
  freckles and Jimmy's movie star looks/sex drive. The majority of
  the story line between Tess and Jimmy has them arguing over a one
  night stand. It was 300 + pages of pretty bad writing. I'd
  strongly recommend taking a pass on this book. Not worth your
  time unless you are looking to take a mini-break from Harlequin
  romances...</Text>
  <Text category="music">This was one of the most dissappointing debut
  albums to come out of the Mid Nineties G-Funk heyday. Warren G.
  didn't even produce one song on this sorry attempt at making
  hard/soft gangsta rap except for the title track that was already
  used on his album a year before. The skits are ridiculous, the
  music is halfass, and the lyrics are amateur. There is absolutely
  nothing that keeps the listener's attention for a whole album.
  This is similar to other West Coast rap albums that play it too
  safe such as W.C. and the Madd Circle's debut and Coolio's "It
  Takes A Thief". One star for the hit single "Summertime in the
  L.B.C.".</Text>
  <Text category="music">Greatest Hits collections of rap artists are
  usually a pretty bad idea. Most good rappers pack a visceral
  punch on first impact, but this wears thin with repeated
  listenings. This is especially true of gangsta rap. With what
  allegedly should represent the best work of B-T-H on one disk,
  this collection falls on its face trying to get around itself.
  Arranged back to back, the rapid-fire syncopated delivery that
  constitutes virtually every track on this collection wears thin.
  The raps blur together, and after two songs, the obscenity-laced
  machine-gun vocal play loses its novelty value, sounding more
  like a stylized novelty than any type of artistic vision. Once
  the raps lose their ability to hold your attention, all that
  remains are the rhythm tracks, which are serviceable at best.
  Their biggest hit, "Tha Crossroads", appears here in a version
  that is completely unrecognizable from its better-known form,
  further reducing the value of this collection. Worse, they
  include a warmed-over version of "F- Tha Police", an exercise in
  futility that only serves to dissipate the power of NWA's
  original. Spending money on this collection is like buying old
  newspaper articles. It might have had some value when it first
  hit the stands, but who wants yesterday's papers? C Tom

  <Text category="health">The reading magnifiers I ordered 09/29/04
  finally arrived 10/19/04 after a call to the seller. (Original
  order was shipped to Amazon.com so it had to be reshipped to me.)
  It only took 5 minutes or so to assemble one of the reading
  magnifiers, and it is possible to adjust it to just about any
  position with the clever arm. The weighted base does keep it from
  falling over. Unfortunately, the thin plastic lense is such poor
  quality that it is very difficult to receive any benefit from the
  device. If the user turned the adjustment knob too far, it and
  the nut that holds it together would fall off. The nut is small
  and must be inserted into the outside of the adjustment knob to
  assemble the device. The knob actually turns the nut onto the
  screw. Presumably the device is for someone with low vision. If
  the small nut falls to the floor, I'm not sure someone with low
  vision would be able to find it. My advice is to save your money
  and buy a quality device with a nice glass lens.... and if
  possible, try the device out before buying.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Mercifully, VH-1 hasn't released the
  nauseating, moron-targeting 'I Love The 90s' DVD series (yet), so
  you'll have to settle for a similarly appalling companion
  soundtrack disc. This is precisely the kind of CD which shouldn't
  even exist anymore given the availability of this material on the
  internet, legal or illegal. There's no rhyme or reason to the
  collection, and the songs you might actually want to
  remember...you probably already downloaded them. The source show
  is easily one of the most appalling projects MTV/VH-1 has
  produced in some time. It's basically a bunch of 'comedians' and
  third-tier celebrities talking about the 80s or 90s (or rather,
  the highlights of what corporate product was released in 1996,
  say) with such fond memories and gusto, hoping the next
  generation ingests this poison with the understanding that Mambo
  No. 5 was a 'good, memorable song' for instance. Avoid at all
  costs. Take pleasure in denying Tag Team their royalties when you
  find their 'classic' song on online...for free</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I just finished the World's Largest Crossword
  Puzzle last night. It's been one heck of a project--approximately
  equivalent to 200 slightly oversized daily crossword puzzles. I'm
  going to love hanging the puzzle on my wall--it really is
  something to behold when it's all done. But it's also a big
  undertaking that requires a great deal of patience and
  perserverance. The puzzle itself is moderately difficult, but
  made more so by the fact that somewhere during the revision (it's
  been re-done once) or perhaps during the original construction
  some errors were made. Because of this, many of the clues don't
  match the answers. Add to that the fact that the author uses many
  hundreds, possibly even thousands, of abbreviations that are
  specific to a certain field (e.g. "Abbreviation used in
  electrical engineering") that no lay person ever has a chance of
  knowing, and you've got what can be an exercise in frustration.
  You can work for hours on one small section and only later find
  out that the clue doesn't fit the answer. I'm generally pretty
  dogged in completing crosswords until letter perfect, but that's
  not possible here. So I had to sacrifice a bit of my honor and
  force myself to give up after a couple of passes through the ups
  and downs. Still, it's about 98+ percent solvable, which is
  pretty good when you consider how intricate the puzzle is and how
  hard it must have been to create. Overall, I enjoyed the process
  and am pleased with the result. If you've got the time and
  energy, I highly recommend this.</Text>

  <Text category="book">I'm on page 110 of this book. The book has 220
  pages. I'm half way done and the author has not as of yet given
  me 1 valuable peace of information to help me forgive the person
  I am angry with. I bought this book because I have a lot of anger
  in me and the preface and reviews from other well know authors
  sold me on it with the belief that this book would help me. But,
  it is having the opposite affect. I feel I was duped into buying
  it (because of the promises in the introduction and the glowing
  reviews). Part 1 tells us what a "grievance" is. It tells us, and
  tells us again, and again, and again. The thing is I ALREADY KNOW
  what a grievance is! I KNOW I'm angry at someone, and I know it's
  not healthy, I know to forgive would help me.... I didn't need
  that to be explained to me over and over again for 59 pages. All
  that reading did was make me dwell and think MORE about the
  problem AND increased my anger because of the book itself. When I
  reached "Part 2", entitles "Forgiveness" I thought FINALLY....
  but all Part 2 has done is repeat what is in part 1 and what is
  in the introduction - how great the study was and how much it
  will help me. There are some great reviews of this book here at
  Amazon and if this book helped some people that is great. But so
  far I can't agree with any of the positive comments. I have a
  great degree of respect for Stanford University, I went to high
  school across the street from Stanford and have taken classes
  there, but it pains me to have such a great school's name
  attached to this book. Is it fair of me to write a review of a
  book I have not finished? No... but I'm afraid to continue
  reading it. I'm already angry and to buy a book that I thought
  would help me, only to find it frustrating me, I don't feel is
  not all that fair either......</Text>

  <Text category="music">While there are some flashes of brilliance in

  short. Faithless, Afrika Bambaataa &amp;amp;amp; Soulsonic, and
  Crystal Method are all good driving tracks at the tail end of
  this album. The high point, without contest, is Darude's ripping
  mix of Rising Star's 'Touch Me'. This is a cut to throw on for
  the peak... when you find the party is just outside of Barstow
  with Hunter. That said, then there are all the uninspired tracks
  in the center of the album. These are more appropriate in an

  <Text category="book">I was disappointed with this longer version of
  The Mill on the Floss. I thought, being BBC and a long version it
  would be a definitive one, but I have to agree with the other
  reviewer. This version left out some very important events, and
  emotions seemed washed out rather than passionate and moving. I
  like long movies, but this dragged because it just doesn't hold
  your attention. The 1997 Masterpiece Theatre version is so much
  more powerful, and keeps all important events intact, spending
  less time on Maggie's mother worrying about the fate of her
  china, and more on character and plot development, with a very
  haunting score. I really hope the other version is released on
  DVD-if so, I will probably donate this one to the library,

  <Text category="dvd">*No Spoilers* We had enough of lame Japanese
  films. This new "wave" of horror movies like "The Ring," "Pulse"
  and now "The Grudge 2" doesn't seem to have an end. The genre is
  played out but that didn't stop the producers from creating this
  sequel which is a sad and incomprehensible follow-up of the
  decent 2004 first version. To understand this film--which is
  nearly impossible until the end--you would have to see the first
  movie. Brief Story: The film has basically three plots, but in a
  way they are connected to each other. The first plot is a
  follow-up of what happened to Karen Davis (Sara Michele Gellar)
  who barely survived the ghosts of the haunted house. Mrs. Davis
  (Joanna Cassidy) asks her other daughter Aubrey to investigate
  what happened to her sister Karen. She travels to Japan to bring
  Sara home. Now in Japan, she finds her in the hospital very
  paranoid about the ghosts of the house, but something terrible is
  about to happen. The second plot is about three school girls who
  visit the haunted house. One of the girls has to go to the closet
  for some kind of initiation that we don't know about. Suddenly
  the girl sees the ghost of the child. She tries to get out but
  the door jammed. They all panic and leave the girl in the closet
  with the ghost. Unfortunately, they are about to find out the
  hard way that the place was not to be visited. The third plot
  takes place in the US where a new family moves to an old
  building. A young kid suddenly notices that the building is
  haunted and the "strange lady" that lives next door has something
  to do with it. People are starting to act weird in this building
  because of the evil presence. Review: Less scary and sillier than
  the original, "The Grudge 2" takes you to a boring and confusion
  movie experience. The movie suffers from too many plots that
  confuse the audience rather than scare them. We have to wait
  until the end to find out how everything relates to each other.
  This time around the ghosts are outsourcing from Japan to the US.
  They don't care whether you visit the house or not. Now these
  menaces are getting medieval to people for no apparent reason.
  These ghosts behave now like viruses that will haunt and kill
  whoever is on their way--even a young little boy--just to show
  their rage. The so-called scary moments are not scary at all.
  They are lame, mechanical and cheap imitations of the original
  2004 first version. What's sad is that, this time around, the
  writers have to make the actresses show some "skin" to please the
  male teen audience. This is what the filmmakers have to use to
  get some kind of momentum going for this movie. In the technical
  department the movie doesn't do a good job either. The editing is
  very sloppy and extremely confusion. We have three plots that are
  poorly mixed together. Sometimes we are in Japan and sometimes
  the ghosts are outsourcing in the US. The photography of the film
  is identical to its predecessor, but that's the only thing that
  resemblances the original. In the sound department, the movie
  will make you laugh. We hear sillier noises than the original.
  Instead of getting scared, you might laugh at the sounds these
  ghosts make--We personally like the angry "kitty" sound. The
  Verdict: A terrible sequel of a decent horror film, "The Grudge
  2" could have been a straight-to-video release if it wasn't for
  the beautiful Sara Michelle Gellar. No scary moments but many
  funny ones--unintentionally, of course.</Text>

  much like modern art, i.e., confusing, confounding and impossible
  to grasp. It also seems like Jarre was a bit over confident when
  he recorded this album. He had recorded some of the best synth
  albums of all time and decided to create a total arts album and
  it just does not work. This is an album that should have stayed

  <Text category="book">Despite the fact that Hanegraaff's name is the

  this very small book are worth reading, and they are the writing
  of Paul Maier. His research is helpful, but so limited in scope
  that you wonder if he wasn't given a week-end to write it and
  come up with as much as he could. Every topic needs futher
  information. A lot more could be said, and Maier seems to be the
  kind of scholar who could have done a lot more. Hanegraaff
  contributes 29 pages of defense of the historical Jesus which is
  an even more surface-level reworking of information covered much
  better elsewhere. That said, I would give this book to someone
  who isn't much of a reader but for whom The Da Vinci Code has

  enjoying this book even in 20 years... I've read so many reviews
  raving about how 'poetic, sensual, wonderful' it is and what a
  talent the person is...sorry I don't see it! Anyone can write a
  bunch of sex stories. I didn't see anything poetic in the
  writing...it was plain. As for sensual and arousing? Hardly. It
  was crude, and vulgar. It was sex, sex, sex... and presented
  harshly, with none of the sensuality, the sweetness, the gentle
  pleasure one likes to associate with sex... it was boring,
  repetitive, and I'll admit disturbing. What was the point of the
  story where the Hungarian whatever forced himself on his
  adolescent children? Or the raped little boy? It was just weird.
  There's just the sex, and no development of any points she may be
  trying to make. It's kind of just left there...unfinished...
  unsatisfying. Frankly, it was so distasteful (VULGAR), I was

  <Text category="book">If this movie was ever going to have a chance,
  it needed to be about 4 or 5 hours long, or never attempted in
  the first place. Some books adapt well to being edited and
  condensed as a screenplay - Possession just can't be dealt with
  that way. What you have as a result is another story entirely.
  There just wasn't time enough, I guess, to develop the
  characters, or even to include half of them. The only character
  true to the book and left almost intact was Sir George. The rest
  were stripped of their layers and everything that made them
  fascinating, and we are left with painful stereotypes and, in the
  case of Roland Michell, a character who seems to have wandered on
  to the wrong set during filming. My best advice is that if you've

  <Text category="dvd">My 10-mo-old son showed no particular interest
  in this "table". I did not like it much either. Why would a
  10-mo-old show any interest in table items that sing? I have left
  it without legs. Two minutes after I installed the legs my son
  nearly fell with the "table" on his face. Had to uninstall them.
  Not good for active infants. Also not very entertaining. Buy the
  one from Leapfrog but still be careful when you have installed
  the legs because they say that that one is higher than this

  <Text category="toys_games">These diapers are the most awfulest things I
  think I ever bought for my baby. I received a lot of the
  "swaddler" size for my baby shower and I tried to use them for
  about 3 weeks before my pediatrician pinpointed it as the source
  of the relentless diaper rash my son had pretty much from birth.
  Stopped using them and lo and behold, diaper rash gone. Fast
  forward 3 months later when my son was hospitalized for a week
  and these were the only diapers the hospital supplied. Figuring
  that my son was older, maybe they wouldn't do as much harm.
  Wrong. The rash came back with a vengeance. I had to get diapers
  from home for the rest of the stay. I think it's because they are
  lightly scented with green dye inside. Definitely stay away if

  <Text category="dvd">Equilibrium is a curate's egg - its best parts
  are not good throughout, and its worst aspects make erratic
  appearances. The acting is really the least of its problems; the
  cardinal failure was a script that could not decide what kind of
  movie it wanted to be when it grew up. Equilibrium, however
  poorly, aspires to be a dystopian film, and there exists a
  dystopian formula at work in fiction and film alike. Such a
  formula was employed magnificently in Michael Radford's
  adaptation of George Orwell's 1984. Contrarily, films imperil
  themselves in discarding the formula as evidenced by Alfonso
  Cuaron's junky adaptation of P.D. James' The Children of Men.
  There are essentially three parts to this formula. First, there
  must be a depiction of a believable society, and plausible
  justifications for its existence. The author or script writer
  must paint vividly, yet remain nuanced, since at this stage his
  purpose is to show the reader or viewer, without yet telling him
  the philosophy underlying it. Second, two-thirds of the way
  through there must be a conversation between protagonist and
  antagonist, which formally unveils the ethical dilemma. Here, the
  protagonist offers his alternative, usually an acknowledgement of
  the humane. Third, the dystopian resolution lies in the
  protagonist's choice: he must surrender to the system, rebel
  against it, or be conquered by it. The ending, if it is not
  tragic in the classical sense, must be ambiguous; if it is ended
  happily, it is no longer a matter for the reader or viewers'
  thoughts: the problem has been resolved, and he may retire from
  it and become forgetful of it. Libria, the society depicted in
  Equilibrium, is a post-apocalyptic society wherein feeling has
  been criminalized under the pretext that human feelings, and the
  actions carried out on their behalf, represent the fons et origio
  of man's inhumanity to man. The objective of outlawing sentiments
  is the preservation of peace. Is this believable? Ultimately, it
  is not because the viewer is given no other reason for this
  society to exist, no justification for its brutality except that
  it is by this method alone that peace may be preserved. However,
  a desire for peace is predicated on an aversion to war, and
  aversion is something we principally feel. A more believable
  premise would have been the prohibition of certain feelings, but
  it is also unbelievable because it is inconsistent. The
  protagonist (John Preston, a member of the Grammaton Cleric, an
  elite government agency for enforcing laws against so-called
  `sense-crimes') marries, begets children, hesitates in killing
  his partner - what point would there be in any of this in a
  society that had eliminated feeling? And, if we are being
  generous, and suppose that this was done intentionally so as to
  say, "You can never entirely eliminate feeling," it fails still;
  because if the denizens of Libria weren't completely devoid of
  feeling, they couldn't be as cowed as they are depicted. Instead,
  countless times throughout the film characters make comments,
  statements, enquiries that can only have as their possible source
  or response an emotion. To have had characters who were truly
  apathetic, or for whom the fictitious drug Prozium was effective,
  they would have had more in common with Star Trek's Borg. The
  backdrop for this dystopia, then, lacks subtlety or nuance. From
  the first fifteen seconds of film, the viewer ethically objects -
  it remains tediously Manichean throughout. The viewer is given a
  straw man and immediately begins tearing it down and the only
  suspense is literally in waiting for what we know will happen. In
  Brave New World, it is Mustapha Mond's conversation with John the
  Savage. In 1984, it is O'Brien's talk with Winston Smith. In The
  Children of Men, it is a debate between Theo and the Xan. In
  Equilibrium, the formal unveiling of the ethical dilemma happens
  in a haphazard way throughout, culminating in a fight scene that
  lacks the awe inspired by the Matrix three years before. Here was
  the moment for the "talky" bit of the film, the sophisticated
  counter-punch, the moral awakening, the vindication of the human;
  instead, the viewer is given another low-brow, Hollywood
  denouement. John Preston does nothing to justify his alternative
  to the totalitarian status quo - there is no bit of dialogue with
  Father where lines are spoken which conveys the notion that
  "Feelings are essential to thought," or that "peace has been
  obtained at a terrible price." All the loose ends, littered
  liberally throughout the film, are never addressed: Why have art
  in Libria? Why does Father intonate, and raise the pitch of his
  voice to manipulate the masses in a scene reminiscent of a Leni
  Riefenstahl propaganda film? A better film would have
  acknowledged these scenes, and defended their inclusion in a
  climatic dialogue between John Preston and Father (or DuPont as
  it turns out). The conclusion of Equilibrium can be summarized as
  follows: "Good guy kills bad guys, sixty-second revolution
  ensues, people can feel again, hero smiles, time to go to bed."
  There wasn't ever a genuine ethical dilemma anyway: what was
  wrong was obviously wrong, and what was right was intuitively
  right. The viewer never believed the reasons Libria came to be,
  or at least they never found them plausible in the way they found
  Huxley's, Orwell's, James', Zamyatin's, or Koestler's
  explanations. In Equilibrium it was all simply the soft
  groundwork prepared for the banal, unoriginal action movie to
  follow. The plot, then, was in some respects as shallow as the
  tendentious storylines in soft-core porn films: they needn't be
  sensical because no one is interested in the story, but rather
  for the titillation, arousal, and amusement. Many viewers of
  Equilibrium are fans of flashy action sequences (a majority of
  whom were not disappointed as their reviews attest); but for
  those seeking a fuller cinematic experience, Equilibrium is an
  unfortunate disappointment. During the film a woman asks Preston,
  "Why are you alive?" Preston responds with the bureaucratically
  sterile answer, "I'm alive to safeguard the continuity of this
  great society. To serve Libria." "It's circular. You exist to
  continue your existence. What's the point?" she asks. And, what's
  the point is exactly the point about this film.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I knew that this concert DVD was an acoustic
  show so I wasn't surprised that the tempo was slow at the
  beginning. But to start the show with Gilmour tuning his guitar
  was a bit much. Once he did start playing, Gilmour was having
  such a hard time finding his rhythm that I found myself praying
  for the drums to kick in. By the time things settle down, the
  really glaring problem with this DVD comes to the surface. The
  mix is horrible. The crowd noise drowns out Gilmour at times when
  they cheer a song they recognize, he is almost inaudible when
  talking between songs and at many points the backup singers
  completely cancel him out. I found myself constantly adjusting
  the volume which really takes away from the "concert experience".
  There are high points in the show, but the low points are rock
  bottom. Comfortably Numb is a song that millions of people know
  by heart. Two versions are provided on this DVD - from the
  concert and in the bonus section. Neither of the guest singers
  (Robert Hewitt and Sir Bob Geldoff) know the words, have to read
  from sheet music and based on their phrasing have never heard the
  song before. Gilmour would have been better off asking for a
  volunteer from the audience. The very best thing on this DVD is,
  oddly enough, in the bonus section. Screamin' Jay Hawkins' I Put
  a Spell on You, a blues standard performed with Mica Paris and
  Jools Holland, almost makes the DVD worth buying. Almost. Watch
  Jonathan Demme's beautiful treatment of Neil Young: Heart of Gold
  if you really want to see a great acoustic show. That is the gold
  standard.</Text>

  <Text category="book">I grew up reading Harold Evan's Sunday Times -
  in the late 1970s it provided a window on the world that few
  other papers could. I particularly remember comprehensive
  coverage of Egyptian President Sadats historic visit to
  Jerusalem; ongoing coverage of Soviet dissidents and a very
  welcome (I'm Irish) editorial urging Britain to consider
  withdrawal from Northern Ireland. However, from today's
  perspective, the paper's foreign coverage seemed to be written
  from a point of view which could be summarised as `what would the
  world do without Henry Kissinger?' [Indeed this has always seemed
  to be Mr. Kissinger's view also]; and that Soviet
  unreasonableness was a product of American hawkish
  unreasonableness and that balance, compromise and reasonableness
  were achievable with enough negotiation. My memory is of positive
  disdain for the emerging tax revolt in California and absolute
  dread at the more confrontational foreign policy approach being
  urged by followers of Governor Reagan. A major positive for me
  was the explanatory diagrams and the furtively taken photographs
  of Soviet missiles (SS-20s?) being deployed in Russian forests. I
  was reminded of these diagrams in 2002/3 when the modern Sunday
  Times gave excellent descriptions - supported by diagrams - of
  Saddam's mobile chemical/biological weapons labs - which turned
  out not to exist. In saying all the above, I mean both to pay
  tribute to Harold Evans and to put in context the criticisms I
  have of this book - which contains descriptions of his triumphs
  as Sunday Times editor and his difficulties as Times Editor under
  Rupert Murdoch. The book has three sections - the first describes
  some of the episodes which made Evan's Sunday Times great - the
  investigative reports from the Insight team and others, of
  malicious cover-ups of poor quality in the pharmaceutical
  industry (Thalidomide) and the aircraft industry (McDonnell
  Douglas); the publication of the Crossman Diaries - laying bare
  the rivalries and mutual disdain of the members of the British
  Labour Cabinet. Having established his credentials as a
  `vertical' journalist - Evan's term, which he describes as
  `seeking to get to the bottom of things' - and lauding his
  proprietors, the Thomson's, for allowing him to do so, the second
  part of the book deals with the advent of Mr. Murdoch as owner.
  The machinations of Murdoch to gain control are fascinating, the
  Thomson's were drained both financially and personally by the
  losses induced by union activity, and they secretly dealt with
  Murdoch while other offers were being pursued by the editors.
  Murdoch eventually won ownership of both the Times and Sunday
  Times, having given guarantees of editorial freedom to a board of
  `national directors', guarantees, which if breached, were
  theoretically amenable to criminal legal sanction. As part of the
  change of ownership Evans was offered the editorship of the Times
  - one of the free worlds most revered titles. In his description
  of the paper, Evans reveals an almost po-faced reverence for the
  place of the Times as part of the British Establishment - he sees
  it as the paper of record, upholding fair, non-partisan and
  accurate journalism which British society has come to expect. One
  feature of this is his constant enumeration of people's
  educational background, almost every colleague is named and then
  his/her school and university are listed - for example Joe Smith,
  Winchester, Oxford, to establish both social class and academic
  (perhaps intellectual) credentials. He documents the `four
  pillars' of the Times as its reporting of Parliament, its legal
  coverage, its obituaries and its leader columns. Oh dear! Stolid
  stuff, from the fearless, vertical, investigative editor.
  Nonetheless this section contains fascinating accounts of Evan's
  new broom editorship coming to terms with the rather lazy
  attitude to scoops and freshness of news which, by implication,
  criticise his predecessor as editor (William Rees Mogg); and show
  that change was indeed necessary at the institution. Looming
  behind this story is Murdoch's general management style -
  haphazard interventions, secretive finances and lack of budgeting
  and planning. From the text it seems to me that Murdoch was
  overstretched with transatlantic acquisitions, rather than
  covertly scheming to undermine Evans. The third section of the
  book reads a bit like Macbeth - Murdoch plots to renege on his
  guarantees and to impose his will on the editors. The text here
  is well paced and descriptive - the tension plays havoc with
  everyone, save perhaps Murdoch, Evan's second-in-command betrays
  him, various functionaries within the paper either resign or
  become lackeys, the `national directors' turn out to be paper
  tigers (this is too good a pun to delete), the Thatcher
  government sides with Murdoch and fails to taken any action as
  the guarantees are broken, piecemeal. The thrust of this section
  reveals Evans as tragic hero, valiantly striving to uphold
  freedom of speech against the devious, double-dealing Murdoch,
  whose lackeys live in fear of his disapproval. However, by the
  time I got to this section I had, sadly, lost a lot of respect
  for Evan's impartiality, his defence of press freedom seemed to
  me to cloak an innate inability to face change in the form of new
  commercial and political realities. This was reaffirmed in my
  mind when, on the day that Evan's agreed to reign, who should
  phone to commiserate but Henry Kissinger! In the end I think the
  book is important in that it is illustrates that one important
  feature of change and leadership is that they are neither
  comfortable nor, initially at least, popular. Evans, though
  personally engaging - and I'm sure mercurial and demanding - came
  to represent a set of fading political beliefs. The change
  occurring at the times these events described were taking place
  saw the emergence of economic individualism unleashed by lowering
  taxation rates; the antipathy to organised labour and active
  military competition with the Soviet Union. The fading, indeed
  failing, Social Democratic consensus was overthrown by a more
  individualistic and competitive set of beliefs and the process
  was quite ugly, given the sincerely held beliefs on both sides. I
  believe Evans and Murdoch were representative shadows of this
  change. The rest of the story - Evans attractive forthrightness,
  Murdoch's furtive acquisitiveness - while the human interest
  focus of the story, are ultimately a side show. This book is well
  told, highly dramatic and engaging, however seen at a remove of
  twenty five years it is a lament from someone who worked hard to
  become part of an establishment whose day was done.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This is probably the worst war related movie
  I've ever seen. I am particularly incensed by several actors who

  <Text category="dvd">I give this movie 1 star because it lies to
  the viewer. This movie is NOT Bram Stoker's Dracula, but a
  rip-off of the character and then puts the modern spin on the
  story. If it was named something else or even kept the name
  Dracula out of it to begin with but called him a different name
  I'd give it 5 stars. If you want to see the real Dracula story
  first read the actual book by Bram Stoker, then watch the silent
  film Nosferatu. Nosferatu is the only Dracula movie that gets the
  story right. Dracula is a monster, he's not a star crossed lover
  at all and wasn't intended to be. People wanted there to be some
  hidden message so they could justify a reason for their otherwise
  worthless literature degree but there simply isn't one. It's a
  horror tale, not a vieled porn book, and certainly not a love
  story. If anything the ones that fail to understand Dracula time
  and again are his victims who fall prey to his seduction by being
  anthropomorphic toward him</Text>

  <Text category="toys_games">If you are a picky mom like me...i.e you DO
  NOT let your child watch "sponge bob" or "Scooby Doo" and you
  maybe even read Mothering Magazine, DO NOT get this book. I
  didn't feel the jokes were appropriate, I guess I am a bit of a
  nerd about these things. It isn't funny to have a headless man
  poor beer/ale down the "hole" in his neck. They discussed
  murdering Shrek (hey leap pad, not age appropriate!!!!), and I
  didn't like to see "human" Shrek in chains fighting to get free
  (nor did my son). They have "ugly" phrases that could have been
  more kid friendly, my son pointed out the ugly phrases, and
  snarled his nose at them saying "Mom, that was UGLY!". I was
  dissappointed with this book, and I am taking mine back to the
  store. I really like the leap frog system, even though I don't
  normally buy toys that require batteries...i.e the toys do
  something for the kid, instead I normally buy "old fashioned"
  natural toys where my son has to make the toys do stuff (blocks,
  leggos etc) BUT I REALLY love this system. It is a treat for my
  son to have an electronic toy so he really gets into Playing it
  and of course "accidently" learning. I also didn't like the Hop
  on Pop leap book for similar reasons, even though the Dr. Suess
  part was great, the leap pad people added unneeded "ugly" phrases
  again that were just NOT age appropriate. Although I did like the
  minimal writing on most of the Dr. Suess pages. I do like the
  regular "Leap" ones...moss lake etc, and the honey pot one with
  pooh bear. Sorry to be so picky, if you are not picky you will
  probly like this book.</Text>

  and has talented and credible actors. Unfortunately, there is
  barely a story with a lot of poorly-developed characters who are
  "trained"/brainwashed and instructed in the ways of death and
  inhumanity. The settings and group "sermons" from Nazi officials
  are striking and convincing, but there is nothing that ties it
  all together. Our hero fails to strike the "killer blow" and is
  stripped, literally and figuratively, of all status and walks
  away. The end. I'm forced to comment that this is marketed as a
  gay film, and I was surprised by how un-gay it was. In fact, the
  two boy "friends" work together at one point to spy on a lady in
  a state of undress. It's more about a childhood relationship in
  the midst of chaos than anything else. I have issues with some of
  the pacing as well. I found myself pressing the fast forward
  button several times, and didn't really seem to miss much. Not a
  good sign. So, for what it is, it's okay. Certainly not a
  masterpiece, and certainly not something to run out and
  buy.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Purchased five of these sets thinking they
  would be fun stocking stuffers. Wanting to check out what I
  purchased, I opened one of the five. The geodes are tiny (not as
  pictured). It was like breaking open dirt-clods... that have a
  small empty space inside... but not crystals. Maybe it was a
  "dud" box, but will probably be returning the other four.</Text>
  <Text category="health">Am I the only one who didn't get a complete
  book? At first I noticed there was some poor editing - lots of
  typos. But then after page 180, where page 181 should be (Sleep
  chapter), it goes back to page 117 (Discipline chapter that I
  already read). It continues to repeat pages 117 to 180 (a whole
  63 pages duplicated!), then picks up again on page 245 in the
  middle of the School Days chapter that I don't have the beginning
  of. I'm completely missing pages 181-245 (67 pages). Other than
  that, good for a few laughs and a handful of ideas</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">My 14 month old son loves the Baby Einstein
  series. They've been the only movies to hold his attention. The
  sounds and music get his attention, the shapes and colors hold
  it. That said, this movie never got or held his attention. There
  are no interesting sounds or music. The voices are very monotone.
  While I understand the intention of this video, if you don't
  catch the attention of the child, what's the worth in it? The
  pictures on the screen do not corrolate well with what is being
  said. I also believe that there is value in learning not only
  foreign languages, but foreign cultures. If I knew what was being
  said when nursery rhymes or poems are recited, I could repeat
  them in english as an additional learning tool. All around, this
  move was disappointing</Text>
  <Text category="health">I had the same problem as everyone else in
  getting any of the Infantastic dvds from Amazon. I waited over
  two months, kept getting reassured that they were still coming,
  and then discovered one day that they had simply canceled my
  order without letting me know. Not only did no one ever offer to
  check with the company directly for the source of the problem or
  actual anticipated wait itme, but Amazon continues to post these
  items on their web site with a delivery date of 7-11 days, which
  is at best a misrepresentation, and at worst a complete lie
  because they are well aware that they can't provide the product
  at all at this point. I don't really care whose fault it is that
  the product is never available - Amazon needs to stop posting
  these dvds for purchase until they are confident the orders can
  be filled in the time noted.</Text>

  <Text category="toys_games">Our family bought this tank and we went
  through plenty of goldfish with it. We stopped buying when our 10

  it up and down and turning it and when she was finished, she put
  it down and saw that she had put it down on the actual fish. The
  fish was bleeding and died. The kids were not very happy. I guess
  this is an okay tank but not great. You might want to put only
  beta's in it. I would suggest getting something with a filter and

  <Text category="toys_games">Mixed low review- The single biggest negative
  is the contrast/brightness level of the screen, which makes it
  near impossible to see except at certain angles and light

  Otherwise, great electronics, features, and stylus operation. I
  would try to demo this before buying since the screen issue could
  be a deal breaker (unless there is something wrong with mine,

  boys had not played rough with it, it just wasn't the quality
  that I had hoped for. It is a real favorite of theirs, I am just
  afraid that it won't last as long as their imaginations. I think
  that with a few improvements it will be a fantastic toy. A real

  <Text category="book">There is one thing that every cookbook author
  can learn from How To Cook Without A Book: Recipes and Techniques
  Every Cook Should Know By Heart, by Pam Anderson (not the
  big-breasted one), and that is the art of the highly marketable
  title. For starters, this artful moniker really plays on the
  single gal's fears about never being able to put together
  nutritious, attractive, varied, affordable, and delicious meals
  for her future family every single night of the week. You want
  your kids to be armed with more than some simple carbohydrates
  when you send them off into the big bad world. So the plus side
  of this book is the title. That's where it ends. The big idea
  here is to help the reader become a non-cookbook-consulting cook
  by: a) teaching basic cooking techniques that are conducive to
  variation, and b) suggesting mnemonic devices for said cooking
  techniques. Sounds interesting so far, right? Well, the problem
  is that almost all the recipes rely on "canned low-sodium chicken
  broth", which I think is a bit of a weird ingredient. It's even
  included in the salad dressings. Other big hitters include: heavy
  cream, butter, and sour cream. Do people really eat like this?
  Regularly? Why not make the Easy Fruit Parfaits for a quick and
  sweet ending to your meal? Just take a tall glass, drop in a few
  spoonfuls of sour cream, then a few spoonfuls of brown sugar, and
  some berries. Repeat until the glass is filled. Crikey. Sour
  cream, brown sugar, and berries?!? Wouldn't it be just as easy to
  put the berries in yoghurt sweetened with a little squirt of
  Greek honey? Am I totally off base thinking that this sounds much
  more appetizing? Or, if calories are no object anyway, why not
  pick up some Baskin Robbins' Rocky Road on the way home from
  work? That's easy AND it's worth the internal havoc it will
  cause. Oh, and here's a sample mnemonic device that I can't not
  share, it's that good: "Cook tender vegetables with garlic and
  oil, Then toss in some pasta that's fresh from the boil." Pure
  genius, right? Right. In a way, the author was right - I CAN cook
  all these things without a book. But why would I want to</Text>

  never, ever try to verify if it is true or practice anything,
  maybe this book is ok. But if you are serious about it and really

  <Text category="dvd">The film seems to focus on 70's punk
  exclusively. Anything post-1980 is glossed over, clumped together
  and generally viewed with dissapointment by this "documentary". I
  think the film does well documenting the roots of punk, seeing as
  how Letts was steeped in the scene at that time (although The
  Misfits weren't mentioned, which I found odd). The interviews
  with Henry Rollins and Jello Biafra were great as well. However,
  in order to claim to be a documentary, the evolution of punk rock
  is just as integral (perhaps more so) as its origins. I think,
  basically, Letts based the film on his own opinions, likes and
  dislikes instead of actually documenting punk. I was
  disapointed.</Text>

  They didn't even try to disguise his accent and no-one ever

  expecting at least one fresh idea. I bought it on the strength of
  a much earlier book by Nathan Rosenberg (about technology in the

  <Text category="book">If you are looking for a "feel good" book
  about baby boomer retirement, this book may have some value for
  you. But if you are looking for specific in-depth how-to, this
  book isn't the answer. Each segment-work, dreams, travel-is short
  and doesn't address many relevant issues. For example, regarding
  the work chapter, the author postulates that there will be a work
  shortage and companies will hire baby boomers to fill the gap.
  Well, that is speculative with globalism. Those jobs may be
  outsourced. Most are low paying. Many of my highly qualified
  friends are unable to find jobs despite retraining. Yes, there
  may be Wal-Mart jobs but is this your retirement dream? The work
  chapter sounds a lot like most "Do what you love" books. But
  doing what you love is often best as a hobby not to furnish
  needed income. These and other issues facing boomers who want
  meaningful work into their 70s are not addressed. I could pick
  apart other chapters in the same manner</Text>

  various bands that have played with the White Stripes in the past
  and others who knew them when they were just beginning. It is
  mildly interesting to hear about how the band got their start and
  other such details, but it is not something I will watch again.

  <Text category="book">I purchased this book several months ago.
  During that time I've tried several of the recipes - the French
  Lentil soup is very good. The chili and corn biscuit casserole
  was unappetizing. The chili was so-so and the corn biscuits were
  too heavy to my taste. The recipe for Mushroom, French Lentil and
  Chestnut Ragu says to "see Glossary" for the chestnuts but
  there's nothing in the glossary regarding chestnuts. It wasn't
  until I read another recipe (Smoky Chestnut and Sweet Potato
  soup) that chestnuts were discussed. The Mediterranean Salad
  sounds good on paper but was lackluster. Far too much red onion
  (which my guests mostly picked out). Although a number of the
  recipes are relatively simple there are several with very long
  lists of ingredients that take too much time and too many
  utensils to prepare. As someone who works full time, a
  20-ingredient recipe holds very little allure, no matter how good
  it sounds. I had trouble finding some of the ingredients. For
  example, the author specifies several different types of squash
  which I haven't been able to locate at any of my local grocery
  stores or farmer's markets. The book is organized in menus which
  are not listed in the table of contents. If you're looking for a
  specific recipe you'll have to spend some time with the index
  trying to locate it which is not convenient. The author
  definitely has some good ideas but this book probably will sit on
  my bookshelf more than on my countertop</Text>

  good fun - and because it has another layer of movement, it is

  clue to reassembly - make sure that the last two pieces are the

  on each side) fit into the grooves of the ball - be gentle, and

  <Text category="dvd">The only reason I'm reviewing this movie now
  is because I just watched it on TV today. And the only reason I
  watched it was because nothing else was on. So... No, let's be
  fair. I did enjoy Analyze This, I really did, though it wasn't a
  masterpiece that would remain with me for the rest of my life, or
  even for the rest of the day. And I do love both Billy Crystal
  and Robert De Niro; they made a fantastic comedic duo in the
  first movie. I didn't have very high expectations, though,
  because I rarely expect too much of sequels. Once again, I was
  proven right. Analyze That illustrates perfectly why `sequel'
  sounds like such a dirty word. The original film had a spark of
  originality; the sequel merely takes the same idea and the same
  jokes and tries to make them funny again. But of course, that
  could never work. It's the same problem with almost every comedic
  sequel: those who haven't seen the original wouldn't understand
  the jokes, and those who have already heard them before. And that
  is why they fail time after time. So what does this movie have? A
  great comedic duo, a couple of really funny guys. Yeah, and?
  Fathers' Day had an even better pair, look what happened to that.
  A couple of good mafia jokes? Sure, sure. I even cracked a smile
  on several occasions. But that isn't enough. There are thousands
  of comedy films out there; not many of them have that special
  something that makes them memorable, and producers think they'll
  improve their odds by recycling the ones that work instead of
  trying to get new ideas. Newsflash: think again. Nobody watches
  these movies. There's no reason to when you can just watch the
  original again</Text>
  <Text category="music">You'll find better works out there,

  get a bit shortchanged with a mere 30 minutes of music. I would

  Is there any lyric here that Pete hasn't written before? Still
  writing about getting your first hit single?! And sadly the music
  sounds like Face Dances and All the Best Cowboys..etc, but not
  The Who Sell Out or Empty Glass. The band itself sounds faceless,
  generic. The only redeeming features are the raspy passion in
  Roger's voice and Pete's right hand. I hope the complete album
  makes garbage of this review, but unless Pete has written
  truthfully and passionately about something or anything of what
  his life and the world has been like in the last twenty years I'm
  afraid, like Wire &amp;amp; Glass, it will only be a rehash of
  previous works, no matter how good it sounds. Here's hoping I'm
  wrong</Text>
  <Text category="book">Very politically manipulative primer that only
  gives 5/8 of the story. I add 1/8 because the author does
  acknowlege some of the huge problems caused by unbridled global

  that these effects are unfortunate, but that free global trade is
  best for everyone in the long run. There is a lot of interesting
  incidental information as various terms are explained, but too
  often this reference becomes a one-sided sermon for free trade.
  These are the same deceptions that Robert Reich started pushing
  under Clinton. Repubs kept the song going without missing a beat.

  <Text category="book">I was reading about my son. It all sounded
  familiar and the concepts and suggestions made good sense. Really
  talked about a framework of letting the decision making (and the
  consequence of their decision) remain with the teen. Then half
  way the book screeched in a new direction. All of a sudden the
  book went from experienced practitioner point of view to
  subjective parent point of view. When it comes to sex the authors
  don't want you to leave the decision with the teens, they want to
  take that one back, which weakens the premise they present. The
  authors danced around abstinence while never taking a really firm
  position - which I would have respected, if not agreed with. Then
  in the middle of that chapter one of the authors invokes Christ
  into the conversation/solution. If I knew this book was written
  in context of a particular belief system, I wouldn't have spent
  the $22. I would have wanted to know that in advance. Tripping
  over this midbook has completely disappointed me and diminished
  the content and message of this book. Buyer Bewar</Text>
  <Text category="music">Ok, at long last Public Enemy has finally let
  me down by allowing a bunch of sub-par average, non-innovative,
  non-avent guard, DJ's mix there stuff up. Even DJ Spookie's mix
  was not that grand. Everything sounds like beats that I
  discovered in the early 90's. On the other hand, this album is
  only a couple bucks used, so I would HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY suggest
  buying it if only for 54321 BOOM which is perhaps one of the best
  PE tracks ever to come out! Not only are the beats right on, but
  the lyrics are some of the hardest I've heard yet! And for the
  note, my review has nothing to do with me not being flexable to
  change of sound. Infact I LOVE the new PE (Whirl Odor) even
  though it has club friendly sounds, mainly for the fact that they
  are not your mere average club beats (they are very
  multi-layered) and of course the lyrics once again only get
  harder and harder and harder, and more direct and to the point as
  we aproach the last times of this world(lyness)</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">I was disappointed in this video. I came to it
  not as a devout Catholic but as a fan of travel videos. In other
  words, I watched this video with the same motivation I would have
  to watch Shackleton's Antarctic exploration, or something from
  the Globe Trekker series. With that in mind, the target audience
  for this video is not me. It is the religious Catholic.
  Therefore, from my perspective, I can't recommend it. I'm not one
  for all the pomp and circumstance of religion. I don't enjoy
  worshipping the "Holy Father", or watching the construction of
  the clownish uniform of the Swiss Guard. If you are a devout
  Catholic you will probably enjoy this video. If you are not, and
  just came to the video because you wanted a Globe Trekker style
  tour of the Vatican, you are likely to be disappointed. And that
  is what these reviews are for - to let you know whether you will
  enjoy the video or not</Text>

  <Text category="book">Ms Milton admits to her anger at humanistic

  seem to grasp even some of the basic concepts of the people's

  I have spent a great deal pf time studding humanistic psychology
  and writings. I have had the pleasure of being trained in group
  therapy with Carl Rogers, and William Coulson as instructors. Any
  one who really studies these writers will see how bad a job Ms
  Milton did presenting them. She should have let her anger subside
  before she wrote the book. Her bias is extreme and obvious. So
  consider this when reading the book. No doubt Ms Milton will have
  a new career appearing on the conservative religious programs. I
  am sure Pat Robinson and Jerry Falwell have or will book her to

  <Text category="music">I honestly feel that Tesla reached the end
  here. After "Psychotic Supper" failed to get the label support
  that it desparately needed the group just fell apart. With this
  the whole metal scene was falling away anyhow as grunge was dying
  off after the death of Kurt Cobain, and here was Tesla trying to
  make up it's mind what way to go. With the opening track "The
  Gate" it sounded like they were going to head back to the hair
  days of the 80's, but then the next song "Solution" they played
  like a lost and wandering band of the 90's. The rest of the songs
  just followed suit. The groups slogan is "No Machines", but
  there's also another slogan at foot here, and that's "No Music
  Direction", and for some bands that's possibly a workable concept
  as long as there's an inkling of where the bands roots are. With
  Tesla it's all over the board where they would score a top 10 hit
  with an acoustic version of the song "Signs", which is a rock
  song, to where they do a cover here of Joe South's "Games People
  Play". I feel that Tesla failed to show thier influences here,
  and was just trying to make a living; which is not a bad thing,
  but it pretty much kept them at a cult status. I pretty much had
  this album, but didn't listen to it at the time as I was trying
  to leave the secular music scene behind, and just move onto
  Christianity, and I know the album lurked around in my head all
  this time, so I felt it was time to face it; I feel that the
  album is below par for a group that can do some memorable songs,
  and to me it seems they wanted out of the label, and possibly
  away from each other.</Text>
  <Text category="health">Some products lead to real improvement of your
  skin (retin A, exfoliators) while others simply cover up the
  imperfections acting like a make up. The sad and hillarious thing
  is that most consumers mix up makeup effects with real skin
  improvement. The Regenerist contains SILICONES that fill in small
  wrinkles and mattify the skin surface thus acting like an
  invisible makeup. Such effects lead most consumers to believe
  their crow's feet are smaller. If you really want to do a test,
  you should stop using the product for a few days using only face
  wash. If during that time you observe smaller wrinkles then the
  product works. You can't really claim the wrinkles are smaller
  while the product is on your face covering them hello.... And
  another thing, a wrinkle can't be erased in one or 3 weeks - the
  skin doesn't produce collagen that fast (unless you cut it).
  Paying $18 / 1.7 oz (retail price, its cheaper on amazon but you
  have to pay shipping price) for a silicone makeup is a little
  steep for me provided that there are cheaper products on the
  market that will make your skin look equally good cause they
  contain the same silicone base even better - try Monistat

  have been using Matrixyl(the active peptide in Regenerist) for 6
  months in my own formulations (without silicones) and frankly

  <Text category="book">"Being a lover of freedom, when the [Nazi]
  revolution came, I looked to the universities to defend it,

  whose flaming editorials in days gone had proclaimed their love
  of freedom; but they, like the universities, were silenced in a
  few short weeks.... Only the Church stood squarely across the
  path of Hitler's campaign for suppressing the truth. I never had
  any special interest in the Church before, but now I feel a great
  affection and admiration for it because the Church alone has had
  the courage and persistence to stand for intellectual and moral

  When you have two sources contradicting each other so heavily,

  no biased motive to either slander or praise the beforementioned

  THe doll is beautiful. She did not quite sit the right way in her

  it will tip. My daugther did not like that we could not just dry
  the doll off with a towel, so she could take it around the house

  doll and it was her favorite, until two months later when the

  <Text category="dvd">This obviously is a re-release of the OLD
  "Empire Strikes Back" kit released in the 80's. A decent size kit
  (approx 15 inches) it gives an experience modeler a good
  opportunity at super detailing. The kit is relatively easy to
  build out of the box, but it has many inaccuracies most notably
  the inaccurate sensor/bridge deflector DOME on top of the ship.
  These inaccuracies can be addressed by looking in the Internet
  for replacement parts and articles on addressing those
  inaccuracies. However, the kit is worth the price. My only
  disappointment is the kit is not in scale with the new "Republic
  Star Destroyer" from "Revenge of the Sith". The new kit for the
  new movie is over 19 inches long. In order for this kit to be in
  scale with the current movie version, it would need to be about
  24 inches long. Hopefully someone will make the "Imperial Star

  <Text category="dvd">I've had the opportunity to watch the movie
  Stealth over the past week. It was on TV here. Otherwise, I don't
  think I would have watched it. My instincts would have been
  correct. An action technothriller, Stealth has a predictable
  plot. A new elite team of 3 good-looking pilots gets a new
  wingman on their first mission in the field: an artificially
  intelligent stealth aircraft which picks up the bad habits of the
  3 pilots, including a disrespect for authority. Mayhem ensues.
  People die. The leaqd pilot develops a relationship with the
  artificial intelligence, and they work together to save the
  female pilot, who's gone down in North Korea. The plot,
  direction, and acting combine together to produce performances
  from the 3 leads (Josh Lucas, Jessica Biel, Jamie Foxx) that are
  about as wooden as their electronic counterpart. I'm sure that
  people went to see this because of the 3 beautiful leads, and
  came away disappointed. Me? I was expecting little, so I guess my
  expectations were met. Though I will say I was amused by the last

  <Text category="dvd">I expected so much more from this movie, I
  guess since the cast included two of my favorite actors (Jolie
  &amp;amp; Washington) and also had the always on point Queen
  Latifah as well. I watched with full expectation to absolutely
  love this movie, but I walked away bitter with shattered
  expectations. First off I will say that Latifah was wonderful
  here and she proved as the only reason I smiled on occasion
  during this movie experience. Washington and Jolie on the other
  hand were so unbelievable (especially Washington who really
  strained in this role) that I was constantly asking myself "do I
  really like these two?" and I had to remind myself of movies like
  'Gia' and 'Training Day' to answer with a resounding "YES!" The
  film follows a rookie cop (Jolie) as she helps a quadriplegic
  ex-cop Lincoln (Washington) track down a serial killer mimicking
  the killings detailed in a book called 'The Bone Collector'. The
  ending is really annoying since the revelation of the killer,
  while not who you'd pinpoint, is not of any significance and so
  it manages to stir up absolutely no emotion whatsoever. It's like
  "oh so he/she did it...interesting"...and I'm bored. I'd skip
  this one for it becomes generic within the first five minutes and
  stays that way until the credits finish rolling</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Our daughter became this as she was a baby. We
  tried several time during her past 2 years if she would reach a
  moment to like it, but she always wanted to go out after 1 or 2
  minutes. Maybe other babies are diferent, but I think its not the
  right material for such a playground. For a hot environment like
  ours in the south, it quickly gets very hot inside and you can
  not leave your baby or little child alone playing because of the
  plastic material that can be dangerous. We finally sealed the
  holes on the bottom and do not pump up the upper part so we fill
  it with water and use it as a litle pool, thats the only way for
  us to use it</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This is pretty much kid vs kid only. Adults
  cannot play along. You can make it into a solo game for one
  child, but its really more like flash cards for spelling if you
  do that. The product is basically a set of flash cards for
  spelling, with some letter cubes for the kids to spell out the
  words. The rules propose two games, which are basically see if
  the kids spells the word right, they get to keep the card if they
  do, first kid with 5 cards wins. Adults can pretend to play along
  if the child is younger and will "fall for it." It really works
  as a game only if there are two kids the same age playing. I
  don't know, but I can't see my daughter pulling this out when a
  friend comes over. Therefore, to the extent this is a set of
  flash cards for spelling, its kind of expensive for what it is.
  Don't get me wrong, you can definitely make it into a learning

  <Text category="book">While "Talk to the Hand" is inescapably
  mediocre in comparison to "Eats, Shoots &amp;amp; Leaves", a book
  I found amusing, though not up-to-par to its New York Times
  Bestseller status, this book does have its moments. However, I
  was uterrly bloody appalled at the rudeness of Lynne Truss in
  presuming to make a comment that, despite whatever way she meant
  it, ended up sounding like she thought gluten intolerance was a
  choice. I find it interesting that she, or at least her editors,
  did not further investigate the disease (which, indeed, gluten
  tolerance is) before publishing such a degrading remark. Oh, yes,
  bloody well sorry, Ms. Truss, for invading your rude,
  stay-home-and-bolt-the-door causitive world with yet another
  irritation which, I'm sure, someone created just so you would
  have to sit in a restaurant and listen to someone else get
  special treatment for a fad diet. Let's just go and, well,
  obliterate a genetic disorder! While we're at it, we might as
  well just make the lactose intolerant drink milk. If it pleases
  and thanks you, Ms. Truss, we celiacs will eat cake. (Oh, bloody
  hell, did I just say "please"?) Despite the fact that Lynne Truss
  makes this world out to be such a horribly rude place, I have to
  wonder if she's experiencing the effects of projection. In
  explaining how rude we humans are, it was necessary for her to be
  quite rude, as well. It is not simply the celiac remark to which
  I refer: I also found her supermarket incident, in which a kid
  shouts at his mother, "I want that one, YOU EFFING BITCH!", among
  others, a bit offensive. As a member of both the gluten
  intolerant community and the younger generation so responsible
  for this rudeness, I was often thoroughly appalled by this book.
  No, my friends and I don't usually hold doors for each other,
  but, in general, I thank and get thanked in return for a money
  lend or a coffee downtown. Frankly, I find myself more often in
  the perpetual motion of manners with my friends, as well as
  strangers, than in a cycle of rudeness which includes swearing
  for the sake of swearing and no regard for others. I can safely
  say that all of my friends ignore their cell phones if we are
  having a conversation, or, if they must answer, they apologize
  profusely before going outside to talk so they do not offend the
  people around them. I have to argue that we are not a select
  group. In today's world, one sees what one expects to see; one is
  treated as one expects to be treated. Ms. Truss, I believe, would
  find that perahps if she simply lowered her expectations slightly
  and gave out all the respect she possibly could, she would be
  surprised to find that, when people are rude, she cares less
  because she knows that she, at least, is doing her best not to
  be. If she did this, maybe she would be less likely to jump all
  over people who are rude because she would not be so worried
  about her own behavior. My last complaint is this: "gluten crap"?
  You would think that such a sophisticated, eloquent (as she is
  dedicated to proving) person as Lynne Truss would have been able
  to find a better word to describe gluten than the third-year,
  am-I-not-so-cool-and-bitchin' (?) style word "crap.</Text>

  the electronic version are different, in that you lose all your

  old version better. I'm planning to return this and get the old
  version</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I played this at a friend's party, and it was
  a wretched party game. It basically consists of a person reading
  the puzzle in a monotone voice and allowing everyone else to
  attempt to figure it out. It is incredibly monotonous, and a
  throughly awful game to play at a party. I admire its cleverness.
  It took a lot of creativity and know-how to make up these
  challenging puzzles. But for the sake of all your guests, I
  emplore you: Hide this boring game. Hide it as well as possible.
  The painful thing is that out of a choice between Mad Gab and
  Lost: The Game my friend chose Mad Gab. It's sad, really</Text>
  <Text category="music">I have *NOT* listened to this album in full. I
  am, however, completely turned off by the fidelity of all the
  samples I have just listened to. There's NO excuse for an album
  sounding that bad in '69. Ghad, there was Zeppelin, Hendrix,
  Clapton, Miles - who recorded this thing? All musicians on this
  CD are superlative examples of their mastery of their
  instruments, but the above reviewers in general are correct.
  Holdsworth MADE Lifetime along with Tony William's kick-ass
  drumming, and most probably insisted - perfectionist that he was,
  and still is - that it *sounded* like something other than a
  bootleg. Personally, I'd regard this as something a collector
  should have - it's for a devotee, not for someone trying to
  access the genre for the first time because the fidelity is just
  darn terrible - and one of the above reviewers is so correct.
  It's like Dylan looking for his "Girl From The North Country", or
  "Knocking on Heaven's Door". At least they let Tony Williams in
  so he wouldn't sing any more! All gags aside, a dissapointing
  effort. Overpriced, but one to have if you are a collector. You
  have to strain to hear the seed of what was to become
  Holdsworth's version of Lifetime, which I have not forgotten for
  30 plus years. A quantum difference in fidelity, and quality of
  music. I'd rather buy Tony William's Lifetime Collection if I had
  to make the choice. I'd be tempted to pick this one up on peer to
  peer if I was desperate... Very UNimpressed</Text>
  <Text category="music">can it be that people are letting their
  personal beliefs block the receptors in the brain that signal bad
  music? ive listened to many bob dylan albums, and every one is a

  which ones we love, because we all know what bob dylan's worst
  record was, and its saved. im not one to question this man's
  beliefs or anything like that, bob dylan deserves all the respect
  in the universe, but could it be that bob dylan made a transfer

  have made the transfer to make a mockery of the christian faith?
  almost certainly not. but only a seriously bad album could have

  <Text category="book">I received my Ph.D. in Theoretical and Applied
  Mechanics from one of the best U.S. universities, and for more
  than thirty years was teaching and researching in the field of
  solid mechanics. Before starting the reading of this book, I was
  in the agreeable mood with the author's that machines can never
  be human, and that AI will retain (if not forever) for a very
  long time its name - unreal. But, now, I am dismayed. The author
  unsuccessfully used 450 pages full of topics in mathematics and
  physics to support his point of view, making simple topics sound
  difficult, and making diffcult ones look impossibble. The
  inclusion of his strange tilings is strange. All in all, the book
  does not make sense. Moreover, his 'Note to the reader' (which is
  patronizing, arrogant and deceiving), and his Prologue and
  Epilogue (which are at best cynical) should have warned me not to
  venture any further. I cannot help feeling sorry for myself and
  for several other readers; and most of all, if this is the
  author's usual way of communicating his ideas, for his students.
  Luckily, I did not buy this book; for one person, who could not

  <Text category="dvd">I don't consider myself a hardocre 50 Cent

  in an issue of XXL. It wasn't all that entertaining. The
  documentary doesn't really tell the people anything that we don't
  already know. We've seen all these videos before, but the video
  for &amp;amp;quot;Heat&amp;amp;quot; is straight wack. The street
  version of that video is much better and somewhat funny. The Show
  In Detroit isn't entertaining at all unless you just get a kick
  out of 10 people on stage chanting the words right along with 50
  while making it impossible to understand a word that's being
  said. The sessions @ AOL are straight pointless and why did we
  need an 8 Mile DVD trailer? The DVD borders on corny, but the CD
  isn't that bad. These are all songs that most diehard fans have
  already heard on his underground bootlegs, but I had not been
  able to find the &amp;amp;quot;8 Mile Road (G Unit

  Banks kills that track and that song is now contained on this CD
  / DVD release. If you're a Young Buck fan, you should know that
  he's nowhere to be found on this release. Overall, The New Breed
  isn't completely terrible, but it loses its novelty after one or
  two uses. The three songs on the CD are decent, but you probably
  have them already. I would only reccomend this to the die hard 50

  <Text category="dvd">I live in Colorado, one of the states that
  receives emergency funding because the illegal alien situation
  has gotten so out of hand. This movie is about a town called
  Farmingville and the disruptions in their lives as they
  (literally) wake up to find mass groups of illegals outside of
  their neighborhoods. Some live 20 to a house and have cars coming
  and going every day-(imagine how that would bring down the resale
  value on a home?) The aliens surround the streets to hustle for
  work right out in the open. The video documents the two sides (
  the ones who support, and oppose) the situation. The side that
  opposes the intrusion into their lives painfully reveals their
  exasperation at their own city's inability to instill order and
  law. As women who go to the neighborhood 7/11 are whistled at,
  they become nervous ( as a women offered in the
  video-unfortunetly it was not shown). The thick misogyny in the
  Mexican aliens was especially disturbing (example: a women who
  was with a special interest gruop to offer services to the
  illegal men was unsure whether they would listen to her, as in
  the Mexican culture). Some create groups in support, others
  create and claw for order. Eventually a town meeting is called in
  which one of the women who runs the opposing group is called a
  rascist by her own politicians as he is flanked by two illegal
  aliens who nod in agreement. It is especially poignant to watch
  as this everday American women brings the situation to her
  counsil members. They call her a rascist, and many of the illegal
  aliens surround this politician in support.It was disturbing to
  see a foreign lawbreaker have more influence over our politicians
  than one law-abiding women and her attempts at trying to instill
  order in her own town. I don't believe it portrayed the opposing
  townspeoples side very fairly. They had every right to be
  exasperated-our we not in a terror war? Since when does Mexicos
  problems come before our own? Maybe because it was made by Carlos
  Sandaval it was more unobjective. I felt the film more unfairly
  depicted the opposing (against illegal immigrants) as 'mean'
  rather than literally mindblown and aggravated their laws weren't
  being enforced! When does the nations people not have a voice in
  their own country?</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">With the phenomenal success of "The Poseidon
  Adventure", the first disaster movie of its kind, the sequel was
  sure to be a hit. Not so. A plot containing two rival treasure
  salvagers combined with survivors still on board sounded great.
  Having a leading lady (Sally Fields) fresh from an Oscar win and
  a few veteran actors (Michael Caine, Karl Malden), might also
  sound promising. Unfortunately, the magic of the set production
  of the original is not even close. Instead of upside ballrooms,
  barber shops, kitchens and bathrooms, the audience is presented
  with storage rooms simply full of boxes. The rest of the cast is
  comprised of television actors, who are as wooden as the script.
  There's no tension and some of the lines are so incredibly
  ridiculous, you won't even laugh in disbelief. Irwin Allen had
  gold slip right through his fingers with this very promising

  <Text category="book">The Venona Secrets is a deceptive book. It
  tries to pass itself off as an objective portrait of Soviet
  spying in the US, but by the time the reader is a third of the
  way in it becomes apparent that the authors are more interested
  in smearing "Liberals" than in painting a true portrait of their
  subject. Although the information the authors provide is
  interesting, the biased and heavy-handed way it's presented
  negates whatever scientific value it might have. For example, the
  authors insist that J. Robert Oppenheimer was working for the
  Soviets (they call this a "fact") yet they present absolutely no
  proof that Oppenheimer was anything more than an idealistic,
  naive man who couldn't keep his mouth shut and whose only
  contribution to the advancement of Communism in America was money
  to the CPUSA. The book is full of these so-called "facts" with
  little to nothing to back them up. The authors praise Joe
  McCarthy and claim in the last chapter of the book that he was
  barely a factor in the anti-Communist hysteria of the 1940's and
  1950's, ignoring the fact that MCCarthy capitalized on fears of
  Communism obscenely and was wrong far more than he was right
  about who was and was not loyal. McCarthy's methods of terrorism
  and hypocrisy in running hearings that could have been chaired by
  Stalin are completely overlooked, as are the innocent lives he
  destroyed in his smear campaign. The authors also praise Senator
  Henry Jackson as some sort of all-American crusader against
  Communism, not even mentioning that all of Jackson's
  anti-Communist attacks were motivated by his virulent
  anti-Semistism and hatred of blacks. Overall this book is nothing
  more than an indictment of Liberal ideology -- one can simply
  hear the disdain for Liberals dripping from the authors' prose --
  and should not be given much credence by scholars not interested
  in right-wing propaganda who want an objective account of Venona.
  The authors have sacrificed their credibility for their
  Conservative agenda; they deserve not to be taken
  seriously</Text>
  <Text category="book">I'll put my opinion first, so there won't be
  any doubt in your mind. I don't believe that you can write useful
  books about national character. Is there really such a thing as
  &amp;amp;quot;national character&amp;amp;quot;? People are just
  too different, too unpredictable. How well can you predict the
  behavior of the people closest to you ? How well can you predict
  what people in your own country will do ? Would every Italian, if
  they could write well, have written the same book as Mr. Barzini
  ? I seriously doubt it. So what we have in THE ITALIANS is one
  man's views on the conglomerate nature of 50 million Italians.
  After reading it, I felt even more strongly that such books,
  though possibly entertaining, are a waste of time. An informative
  book about unicorns--but do they exist ? Anthropologists have
  been concerned, for many years, in getting the
  &amp;amp;quot;inside view&amp;amp;quot;--the view of a culture as
  seen by the person within it. While Barzini is indisputable
  Italian, he tries to visualize Italians as seen by foreign
  visitors, then explain to those of us not lucky enough to travel
  there, why they are as visitors see them, or why they are not as
  foreigners may think. This is not a successful gambit. Cultures
  are based on many general factors--like history, socio-economic
  patterns, religion, family, etc.---but the specific results are
  just that, specific. Barzini covers many topics--the importance
  of spectacle and giving an illusion of something rather than
  actually having that quality; the family vs. the state; Italian
  modes of achieving success; the north-south split; Sicily and the
  Mafia; and last, the tragedy of Italy's long domination by
  foreigners. But nothing really connects. There are only
  superficial, scattered impressions, nothing very concrete to
  grasp. The reader is left with a handful of stereotypes. Barzini
  is at his best when describing the lives and modus operandi of
  particular characters in Italian history. These sections were
  well-written and interesting. But his portrayal of Italian
  &amp;amp;quot;character&amp;amp;quot; is fuzzy, contradictory,
  and ultimately, unconvincing. Finally, if you are a lover of
  lists, you will thrill to this book, because there is a list on
  nearly every single page. Myself, I got pretty tired of those
  lists. If you want to know something useful about Italy, read
  another book. If you just want entertainment, which might support
  any stereotypes you have about Italians, then this book could be
  for you</Text>

  <Text category="book">[the above is an actual quote from the book] I
  don't usually read romances, but got this one at the library. I
  thought: Thriller. Hijacked plane, navy seal...all the right
  stuff. And the beginning was promising. Stan fixes everything,
  and has a human side to him that was compelling. Then the plot
  hit the fan! As a thriller it stunk. The highjacking was
  interwoven into the plot weakly, as an after thought. The
  romantic "tension" between the protagonists was forced and
  irritating. The dialogue is mundane. The message that horniness
  leads to true romantic (Sam and Alyssa) love is rubbish. The only
  worthwhile character was the highjacked girl, and I think it was
  brave of the author to not have her come out unscathed. The
  historic (WWII) componant was interesting. But overall, I kept
  asking who the audience is for this book. Not lovers of thrillers
  like me--and I wonder, do romance readers even care about a
  highjacked plane, or was that just getting in the way of
  wondering whether Teri will ever tell Sam that she loves
  him!</Text>

  <Text category="book">By chance before picking this up I had just
  finished The Heart is a Lonely Hunter by Carson McCullers, and
  was struck by the similarities and differences. It's a great
  "compare and contrast" pair, as an exercise for high-schoolers.
  Both are written as first-person accounts by teen-aged girls and
  are roughly contemporary. Heart published in 1940, and Castle in
  1948, both about life in the 30s. Both families are poor. In
  Castle though, there is never any question that the girls might
  go off and get jobs. This is supposedly because they "don't know
  how to do anything". So instead they sell off their belongings
  and get by on scraps of bread and the odd bit of butter. How
  charming! They are "eccentric", which seems enough in the
  author's eyes to exempt them from the expectation of supporting
  themselves. Only Stephen the handsome young son of the late
  housekeeper, enamored of Cassandra, does work and gives the
  family his entire salary. But he is of the class that is expected
  to toil after all. Even he is rewarded in the end--able to avoid
  labor with an easy job similar to that of step-mum
  Topaz--striking poses. Unlike the looming and grinding poverty of
  Heart then, the poverty in the Castle never amounts to more than
  a lark--educated folks playing at being poor until they're
  rescued by romantic circumstance. Not so in America where Mick
  Kelly, who didn't know how to do anything either, went off to
  work at Woolworth's, and to a life of little hope. In Castle the
  solution comes in the form of that classic deus ex machina, the
  inheritance. Two dashing young wealthy Americans one of whom has
  inherited the castle, show up just in time, with their chatty
  modern mum. They throw money around and talk too much, in the
  cliched extravagant American style. Most of the remainder of the
  novel consists of Cassandra and her sister Rose swooning over one
  brother or the other, with an eventual romantic result that
  assures all the characters of economic well being. It's all so
  very charming, bourgeois, and harmless. If your life is hard
  don't worry--a man will show up to rescue you! The reviews for
  this novel in Amazon are overwhelmingly positive. Smith was
  obviously talented. Her writing is elegant and a pleasure to
  read. I wish she had given Cassandra a little more
  ambition.</Text>
  <Text category="health">Although I have used many electronic cuff
  devices in the past, this is one of the worst at providing
  accurate readings. Firstly, the cuff is not adequate for very
  small or larger wrists and the readings are often lower than what
  you would get if the blood pressure were taken manually the
  traditional way. In a clinical setting, it is important that you
  get adequate readings so that the patient can receive the proper
  treatment based on their readings. It is imperative since you may
  or may not give medication depending on what you recive via the
  blood pressure measurement. I have taken a blood pressure
  manually after getting what I considered a questionable reading
  only to discover that the wrist blood pressure was far too low
  and more aggressive measures had to be taken because of the data
  that was retrieved the old fashioned way. Imagine had I taken the
  initial reading as truth and the patient may have had a stroke as
  a result. As a rule, I never recommend using these devices for at
  home use because of the risk of false readings. Many people who
  suffer from hypertension feel that this is a good way of
  monitoring their blood pressure when in actuality it is giving
  them a false sense of security. If you are considering buying
  this product for at home use or for use in a clinical setting,
  please ask your doctor or nurse for their opinions.</Text>

  <Text category="music">one word. generic. terrible. boring. (well,
  they are all one word) people must learn to have a better taste
  in music. granted there is at least one good song. a few others
  are decent, but only because there are no vocals. if you have
  heard any new band for the last 3 years, you have heard pulse
  ultra. my friend likes breaking binjaman (another uber generic
  rock band in my book) and he listened to 2 songs from pulse ultra
  and said "thats enough". do yourself a favor and buy a GOOD cd.

  <Text category="health">I bought this curling iron impulsively, as I
  perused through the "gold box" items some time ago. When I first
  received the it, I was amazed at how well it worked; it heated up
  quickly, and did a wonderful job on my hair. After a couple
  months, I turned it on, left the room for a minute, and came back
  to find the tip melted off, hanging from a strand of what little
  plastic was still attached. I thought about returning it, but
  decided (rather stupidly, in retrospect) to continue to use
  it...BIG MISTAKE. It heated up way beyond what it should have,
  even when I put it at a "low" setting of 5. When I attempted to
  use it, the sizzling sound indicated to me that I had, indeed,
  made a mistake. The next day, coworkers were commenting on my
  lovely new SHORT haircut. If you're really interested in
  purchasing this item, please learn from my mistake, and if the
  tip melts off, take that as a sign that it will also melt your
  hair</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">What a HUGE disappointment this release is. I
  was suspecting that it wouldn't be all that great when I saw that
  the studio that originally produced this show, 20th Century Fox,
  was the same video company releasing it. Well, the first season
  looks horrible. The source material is all 16mm dupe prints, some
  parts of which are out of focus, scratched and dirty. In all
  cases the image is soft and, well, like 16mm. Compared to what
  Fox is releasing of VOYAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA, produced the
  same year (1964) and at the same studio as BOONE, this release is
  nothing short of a disgrace. We should be given pristine 35mm
  source material, and we're not. I suspect Fox wouldn't release
  the original camera negs from it's vaults without a substantial
  fee. Anyway, season one of DANIEL BOONE isn't worth buying. I
  haven't seen season two, when the show started filming in color,
  but I'm now afraid to look</Text>
  <Text category="music">I said I was going to be honest in all

  Simply put. They can't sing, and the songs are boring. I'm sorry
  I bought this CD, and other people might not like me saying that,
  but it's my opinion. I listen to power metal extensively and
  there is MUCH better stuff out there like Symphony X, Nightwish

  folks who wrote reviews...what qualifies him as an instructor? I
  think he's doing an injustice to Salsa. If anyone is considering
  learning from these DVDs...don't. You'll not only learn some bad
  habits in dancing, but you'll be a joke on the dance floor. The

  <Text category="music">Hate to say it, but this is pretty drab stuff.
  That said, I'm hardly about to complain; how could I? This was
  obviously written for a film (that I have no interest in seeing),
  and Mogwai just released 'Mr. Beast', a solid (if unspectacular)
  album earlier this year. I kind of see 'Zidane' as a gift, then.
  Looking at the whole thing from that perspective, it's impossible
  to be letdown. But then, retaining much emotion out of this
  composition is downright difficult. Mogwai, when channeling the
  right energies, create sublime, beautiful music -- truly as
  beautiful as any form of modern music, to my ears. When they're a
  bit more ambiguous, though, the results tend to float in limbo
  and lack direction. 'Zindane' seems to possess certain elements
  of both these characteristics to an extent, but the result is
  surprisingly dull -- at best, it's pretty; at worst, it's utterly
  monotonous. The ideas are here, too; it's not that 'Zindane'
  lacks drive or intent. It is a focused work. Yet, it's obvious, I
  think, that the music, contrary to most film scores, desires to
  refrain from emotional manipulation. While that's admirable, I
  find that musically, I'd much rather be manipulated than dazed;
  this is literally music to listen to whilst on painkillers. There
  are a few nice themes and motifs, don't get me wrong, but this is
  ALL underscore -- Mogwai, in the best way possible, has a great
  gift at handling melodrama, and here they never appear to be
  guided by the dramatic light. I won't sway anyone from attempting
  to get 'Zidane', but I wouldn't hand it out to anyone unexposed
  to Mogwai in some hopes of garnishing their admiration. No, for
  that, I would naturally lead them to one of their many fine
  studio albums. For, Mogwai is a band, after all -- they are not
  Jerry Goldsmith or Ennio Morricone. For those unaware, Mogwai
  performed much of the score for the recently released film 'The
  Fountain' -- though they did not write any of the actual
  material, from what I've gathered -- and as a musical experience,
  the soundtrack release for that album absolutely blows 'Zidane'
  out of the water. In my opinion, it even beats out 'Mr. Beast',
  so impatient fans who need a fresh dose of Mogwai 'oughta check
  that one out for sure</Text>

  to keep it working. I contacted the manufacturer and got

  they didn't think there should be such problem and refused to do
  anything else. Now I have to keep this defected machine and have

  <Text category="music">I had reviewed the first edition of B'Day and
  I personally called it "Business day" because
  Beyoncï¿½ could not offer what we could expect
  from her especially after the highly acclaimed Dangerously in
  Love. Actually, in my opinion if Ne-Yo had not inserted
  irreplaceable" in this project, it could have been a bust. I
  agree Dï¿½jï¿½-Vu and Beautiful
  liar were hits but I give the credit to the casting rather than
  the script. Had these songs been given to India Arie, God knows
  what was gonna happen! How can she accept to put out such a poor
  album? Some said Beyoncï¿½ views releasing albums
  in quick succession as a means of ejecting herself from her
  contractual obligations to Sony Columbia and team up with Jay-Z
  to form a new record label... but this cannot justify such an
  inconsistent and poor album. Ne-Yo confessed that the R&amp;amp;B
  genre is suffering from serious malaise. "People just forgot what
  it was supposed to be, what it was supposed to feel like, the
  essence of what it is," he says forcefully. "It's a vibe, it's a
  feeling -- it's supposed to make you feel something, as opposed
  to, `Let me go eeh-eeh-eeh-eeh-eeh and put a beat behind it and
  see if people will dance to it.' Come on man. There's more to it
  than that..." Ring the alarm from B'Day falls in the same
  category. I read a reviewer who proclaimed B'Day to be the best
  he's ever had and this is like saying George Bush is the best
  president America has ever had... Does this person know The
  Beatles, Stevie Wonder or Aretha Franklin? I suggest him to go
  back to the stores and get one of their albums and he will then
  be able to differentiate between music and marketing. I suggest
  the same reviewer to get albums called what's going on' (Marvin
  Gaye), Purple Rain (Prince), The Day (Babyface), or even the
  recent Let's get lifted (John Legend). It is very sad to see
  artists (especially hip-hop) concentrating on making hits,
  shooting sexy videos with the major target being going platinum
  and most of the time I find it better to buy the single and not
  the entire album since they all are full of fillers. What follows
  is that after a few months we completely trash their records.
  Africa is the world's second-largest and second most-populous
  continent with 900 million people. Maybe if the same guys had a
  purchasing power which exceeds Latino market,
  Beyoncï¿½ would be realising another edition in
  Swahili which is the most widely spoken language in Africa and
  she would be arguing she's had a great love for African culture
  ever since she was a child pretending she's coming back to the
  roots. Anyway, let's not be fooled by these music industry games,
  their aim is to make money and this entails ignoring the basic
  artistic aspects. I agree bootylicious Beyonce is the hottest
  lady in the music scene at the moment and none has denied her
  natural talent as a singer but she needs to refine her albums and
  give us s.th that can reach our soul. There are some female
  artists who are making good music without injecting too much cash
  in marketing to force sales: Corrine Bailey Rae and Heather
  Headley</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">This movie certainly had some strong actors
  and actresses in it and that with an interesting storyline landed
  it on my viewing list. Overall, I was somewhat disappointed with
  this film. I figured there would be a little more real suspense
  or "thrill" but it never materialized and instead just followed
  many of the usual plot events. The biggest failure was the
  completely unneccessary cheesey romance between Eastwood and
  Russo. It was contrived, lame, and almost laughable. I had to rub
  my eyes to make sure I wasnt having a nightmare! John Malkovich
  does a great job as the wackjob and is totally convincing in this
  role. Unfortunately the script didnt do him enough justice and
  even his character did some staple moves. Clint Eastwood was
  great as always but he did play his usual self. No problem here
  though, Clint was solid. The film just fizzled as it went along
  and it started to get tiresome towards the very end. The climax
  was rather anti-climactic except for the shooting scene which was
  kind of cool although I saw it coming a mile away. There was not
  as much suspense as I was hoping for and the "thrill" was mostly
  missing. What else can I say, watch it and make your own decision
  but overall I was not that impressed and the film let me down a
  bit after such glowing reviews</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">Man did I want to like this movie. Hackman is
  the best and the possibility of finding a mid-70s Gem was really
  tantalizing, but...this film is really, really mediocre. First we
  have sub-plot city going on, bad mid life crisis stuff with Susan
  Clark and Hackman "Trying to communicate" about their failing
  relationship. It's tough on Hackmans character "Harry" see 'cause
  he used to be an NFL player and now he's reduced to being a
  private eye, she hates it, he does not want to give it up and
  everyone concerned gets a bad speech. Don't get me wrong, this is
  no "MegaForce", where the film is so bad it becomes campy and
  actually enjoyable. This is just...mediocre. Buy "Harper" with
  Paul Newman instead</Text>

  <Text category="music">I don't know who these people are, but they
  will give praise for ANYTHING! Ms. London is a wonderful singer,
  but the producers must have given her sleeping pills. This is a
  boring CD! Like Peggi Blu, who won Star Search, her record
  company "toned her down" for her debut album, with banal and
  boring songs with that stupid hip/hop "dum de dum" Mary J. Blige
  beat, which will send you to nowheresville. Aretha Franklin's
  boring SO DAMN HAPPY was so awful, it's no longer available. She
  went "Mary J." and almost lost the crown off her head. Because
  she's Aretha Franklin (Queen of Soul) she DID manage (somehow) to
  get a non-deserved Grammy for "Wonderful" from that CD. The
  Grammys also presented The Queen with her 17th competitive Grammy
  for her "A House Is Not A Home" mess. What MUST they be thinking?
  Well, LaToya London won't be considered for ANYTHING for this
  hip/hop mess. She should get serious about some R &amp;amp; B (I
  mean the REAL r &amp;amp; b) and leave this light-weight fluff
  alone. LaToya, you have a great voice -- use it. Contact Sam
  Dees, Jo Armstead or Ashford &amp;amp; Simpson and BEG for some
  material! And, as Madame Rose would say, "Sing Out,

  <Text category="book">I like Evanovich novels for a light read and a
  few laughs, and usually her hero and heroine are downright
  combustible - the Stephanie Plum and Joe Morelli relationship,
  sustained through 12 books so far, being a case in point. But
  Full Scoop was actually a trial to get through. I could hear
  another voice in there which was distracting and interrupted
  Evanovich's comedic rhythm. The whole tone of the writing was
  down about five notches from what I have come to expect from
  Evanovich. The silly villains were either being too goofy or too
  violent, leaving us wondering were we supposed to be amused or
  frightened? The least forgivable of the sins committed in Full
  Scoop was the fact that there was absolutely no chemistry between
  Maggie and Zack. None at all. So it's hard to label the book: a
  sort of but not really romance, an almost but not much of a
  woman-in-danger.... maybe a new genre altogether - the slapstick
  thriller</Text>

  a great ear for melodies. Unlike most new-age artists, Ryan
  Farish has rhythmic problems. He likes to use the delay effect on

  song or he is simply being too sloppy with his playing (sometimes
  it's one problem and sometimes it's both). I don't know how he
  let those takes make it on to the final album. Also, the
  massively loud reverse cymbal sounds are way overused and make

  <Text category="book">This was the only Bertrice Small book I could
  find in the gift shop of an airport. That should have been
  warning enough not to buy it. Rosamund was an unlikeable
  character. She left her 3 young daughters so she could "make
  love" constantly and then was oh-so-superior with her maid when
  Annie did the same! I guess being a rich, snotty noblewoman means
  you're not held to the same standards of behavior as the mere
  household help. I found the love at first sight meeting to be
  flimsy and contrived. Small's readers are smarter than most, so
  I'm surprised she expected us to swallow it. Like some other
  reviewers here, I thought it was more lust than love. It was
  clearly a mid-life crisis hook up for Patrick. And if Rosamund
  truly loved Patrick, she never would have left him when he was
  ill, memory loss or not! Not planning to read either "Rosamund"
  or "Phillipa", the other books in this series. It was hard enough
  getting through this book, let alone another one with her uppity
  daughter. The good stuff? Getting to meet Patrick Leslie again.

  <Text category="dvd">These are great films and the set is lovely.
  But boo to Criterion anyhow for not sticking up for Cassavetes
  scholar Ray Carney, whose name was removed from the set after
  months of work because of his feud with Cassavetes' widow Gena
  Rowlands. Buy the DVD set, anyhow, you must, but go to the
  Cassavetes pages, find Carney's links, and read his account of
  the troubles he's had, trying to preserve and expose people to
  rare cuts of FACES and SHADOWS he himself tracked down... Sorry
  to take sides -- Gena Rowlands probably has her own
  justifications for feeling as she does -- but I greatly admire
  Carney's contributions to keeping Cassavetes' memory alive and
  exposing people to his films; he put an amazing amount of work
  into CASSAVETES ON CASSAVETES, too. It sucks that he kind of got
  stiffed here.</Text>

  <Text category="music">Don't get me wrong with the 2 stars some songs
  here are really good. Traffic UR Adagio For Strings Nyana Those
  songs are just great and the best off the album. But songs like
  Walking On Clouds Sweet Misery Love Comes Again Forever Today can
  only be enjoyed so little times but they are good though. No song
  here is annoying in the beginning and I see a lot of 5 stars and
  either they are just suckers for Dj Tiesto or they wrote the
  review as soon as they got it. Cause after months of having this
  you will see yourself skipping to songs just to hear the good
  stuff. Dj Tiesto shows he does a good job working with vocals but
  for a number 1 Dj I expect to be hearing his stuff for a long

  bad." Because I enjoyed her e books so much I didn't stop to
  think before purchasing it. I was so happy to have her book, I
  immediately called a friend who also drove to the book store to
  purchase the book. Boy, Did I get it from her the next day.

  <Text category="dvd">I agree that this is technically an excellent
  film. But it is also unrelentingly grim and without a payoff of
  any kind. Given the lowlifes who inhabit this story its hard not
  to sympathize a bit with Richard Widmark's character. His
  enthusiasm is as boundless as his optimism. But in the end he
  doesn't just lose; he is literally thrown away as garbage. And
  then there is the wrestling scene which was so gruesome it was
  hard to take. All in all, I was left with the question, what is
  the point? The commentary leaves a lot to be desired as well. Its
  basicly a description of what you're watching, while you're
  watching it. I see everyone regards this as a masterpiece so I'll
  watch it again but as film noir goes there is something very
  unsatisfying about this movie.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Well you know the drill. Some people will like
  anything that is "artsy" or "out of the ordinary" or "made by
  that great director". Its a different kind of herd but a herd
  nevertheless. The movie is about incest. It is about sex and
  adolescence. And, ironically, it is some kind of a parody of the
  very crowd that is giving this movie rave reviews. The best part
  of this movie is Eva Green. Or, more precisely, Eva Green's body.
  I didn't care about her acting (I thought it was mediocre). I
  just sat there and drunk her body in, wishing that I was that
  lucky actor (whats his name again?). The only reason to watch
  this movie is Eva Green. If she was indeed exploited by the
  elderly director with an intimidating reputation, then I am glad
  it happened. The movie is visually rich. In fact, its so rich
  that Bertolucci seems to be masturbating his sensibilities for us
  all to see. But I will take it. He captures and celebrates Eve
  Green's stunning body - every square millimeter of it(including
  her genitals - the movie is NC17 for a reason), to perfection.
  Other than that, there is nothing else in the movie. The story is
  utterly insipid, the old movie clips, the "discussion" of
  morality or whatever ... nothing interesting. The music is
  another plus point. Bottomline, watch it for Eva Green's body. It
  deserves five stars. But the movie deserves only two</Text>
  <Text category="health">My rheumatologist recommended that I try a wax
  bath product for the osteoarthritis in my thumbs. The cartiledge
  in the left thumb is all but gone, with the right thumb being in
  better shape. The wax bath did not eliminate or ease the pain in
  either thumb, but did greatly improved the skin on both hands. I
  continue to use it just for the dry skin on my hands, and am
  pleased with the results. It's possible that this product would
  have worked better for me if I'd used it earlier, before my
  thumbs got so bad. I plan to use the wax bath for the pain from
  inflammation in my feet, due to rheumatoid arthritis. I did have
  to turn down the heat due to a lifelong and extreme sensitivity
  to heat in my hands, and this is probably why the wax doen't stay
  warm for longer than 10 - 12 minutes, even when wrapped in the
  plastic bags and then in a towel. The initial loading of wax has
  lasted a long time, so I don't recommend purchasing more than 2
  or 3 pounds of wax at a time</Text>

  <Text category="music">I won't go into a long diatribe. Suffice it to
  say that when I listened to this upon its release earlier this

  find that the musical quality is not great. This is more a photo
  of dylan as a free-spirit. There's a point where baez messes up a
  song. (i don't have anything against baez. that being said, i
  don't have much FOR her either.) There's joking and laughing, but
  really, I don't need a double-disk of acoustic material that
  seems to be performed by someone who sounds like he'd rather be
  in the audience than performing. You can almost sense WHY dylan
  went electric in this concert. The bootlegs prior to this are
  superior and I would suggest that if you aren't a die-hard dylan
  fan to stick with them. If you really like dylan's acoustic work
  and not his electric stuff, you should be pleased with this
  double-disc. I love dylan, but not enough to enjoy this over and
  over again. I'll go to disk one of the 4th bootleg for my
  acoustic fix</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Whether William Golding deserved Nobel Prize
  or not is still a debatable point, but it is true that he wrote
  one marvelous book, and its name is `Lord of the Flies.' But
  let's not talk about the differences between the book and the
  film for a while - because after all no one I am afraid can bring
  the multi-layered world of words onto the screen. Even those who
  loved the 1963 version would admit that. You can interpret the
  meaning of `Lord of the Flies' but who can really visualize it,
  or the imaginary conversations of Simon for that matter? The
  biggest problem of Harry Hook's new version is not the changes
  done to the film. The boys are American military school cadets,
  using dirty words frequently, but those parts didn't annoy me
  much. Real problem is something more essential to the film, which
  is storytelling. In short the 1990 film doesn't know what it
  wants to be. On the film's video cover you can read (and I quote)
  `this stunning adventure explores the deep dark corner of the
  human soul." Well, not exactly. For as adventure story it lacks
  pace; the film always feels rushed and often needs better
  editing. As allegory it needs more distinctive personalities for
  each character. The conflict between Ralph and Jack should be
  clearer, and Piggy's role should be more than that of a whining
  fat boy. And don't forget Simon, who sees things, it is true, but
  definitely not those things that the film actually shows us. It
  is a pity that the cinematography is so beautiful. It could have
  been a perfect backdrop against which dark allegorical survival
  story would develop, opposite of optimistic tales of Jules
  Verne's adventure stories. By watching this film you can follow
  the story of the book, but find no tension or thought-provoking
  words in it. Balthazar Getty's feature film debut. And Lewis M.
  Allen, one of the producers of the film, had also produced Peter
  Brook version in 1963</Text>
  <Text category="music">Wow, I can not believe that two of the best

  <Text category="book">The joke here is that Krugman is convinced he
  can write. He ends his little intro with the smug assertion that
  "maybe economists can write after all," offering himself as
  proof. (Krugman cannot write well, but he has mastered the
  clumsy, undistinguished style of a bad lit professor---the kind
  of tenured mediocrity that dominates academic publishing---an
  accomplishment he's very proud of. To use his own favorite
  "emphasizing" gimmick: Krugman stinks---full stop.) The punchline
  is that shortly afterward, The New York Times hired him. It was a
  match made in middlebrow heaven. (I should add that I do like the
  substance of Krugman's newspaper articles, if not the style. An
  enemy of the current White House is a friend of mine.) As far as
  the economics go, he's pro-NAFTA and pro-"free trade" just like
  all establishment economists, and completely unwilling to
  critique the real forces at work in international markets. Don't

  <Text category="toys_games">When this toy is turned on it seriously sounds
  like an air-raid siren is going off. I can't use my usual trick
  of putting tape over the speaker because you need to be able to
  hear the instructions to play the games. Also, the counting/shape
  game is confusing. There is a row of shapes with numbers on them,
  and the game asks the child to, for example, find 3 rectangles.
  It's trying to get the child to press the rectangle shape three
  times, but the rectangle shape is marked with the number 8.
  There's a circle marked with the number 3. The only reason I'm
  not giving this one star is because my son enjoys playing the
  "repeat the tone" and "count the villians" games. I'm not sure
  how much longer the adults in the house can handle the siren

  <Text category="dvd">What a mind-numbingly inept end chapter to a
  series that began with the greatest horror-comedy of all time,
  The Re-Animator. Continuing in his deluded quest to claim the
  Re-Animator series for his own, and to convince us that he can
  direct, producer Brian Yuzna has managed the opposite. Beyond
  Re-Animator merely confirms what was evident about the
  Yuzna-directed Bride of Re-Animator, that Yuzna knows nothing
  about directing actors and story. As with Dagon, Yuzna seems to
  have secured financing from Spanish sources for this film.
  Unfortunately, the problem is that they also tried to force in a
  mostly Spanish cast. This is a story set in Massachusetts, for
  crying out loud -- why would the warden of the prison, the
  reporter coming to cover the story, the guards, and a good 90 per
  cent of the inmates all have Spanish accents? It wouldn't be as
  howlingly horrible if these guys could act, but they can't. Simon
  Andreu as Warden Brando and Elsa Pataky as love interest Laura
  Olney get the most screentime of anyone in the cast, but their
  acting is so bad, and their ADR-afflicted lines so glaringly off,
  that they manage to sink the film every time they open their
  mouths. Yuzna seems to pick his leading ladies based on their
  willingness to take off their clothes (witness the gratuitous
  "nurse nipple" scene in this film, or Fabiana Udenio and Kathleen
  Kinmont in Bride of Re-Animator), and Pataky makes for one of the
  most unsympathetic love interests I can remember. But even Pataky
  and Andreu pale in incompetence next to that blustery, seething
  mass of bad acting that is leading man Jason Barry. Based on
  Yuzna's shoddy history with actors, one might be tempted to blame
  it on the director, but the fact is that in this film, Jason
  Barry is incapable of pulling off a single believable moment,
  basic elementary acting. His every internal and external beat
  rings false, his dialogue delivery sounds like a cold reading,
  and even his basic body movements look like amateur theatre. Most
  high-school students do better than this. Jeffrey Combs as
  Herbert West, seasoned pro that he is, gamely plays along, but
  the script puts West's character so far off to the sideline in
  favour of the vomit-inducing Pataky-Andreu axis that Combs is
  unable to save this film. On a strictly technical level, the
  cinematography looks good, the score is all right (though often
  too serious-minded for its own good), and the film doesn't look
  low-budget. But when the "story" is such a mess and the actors so
  inept, no amount of slick lighting and camera moves can save a
  film. Yuzna really should stick with producing, because on the
  Stuart Gordon-directed Dagon, at least there were some good
  moments. But Beyond Re-Animator is beyond salvaging, possibly the
  worst film sequel I've ever seen, and way up there in the list of
  worst films I've ever subjected myself to</Text>

  story in an anthology was dragged on for over 300 pages. I admit
  I only made through about half before skimming and realizing it
  wasn't going to get any better. There's no sizzling tension, the

  <Text category="dvd">This movie, while not a bomb or a turkey, has
  a couple of serious flaws. One is the casting. Ted Wass has lots
  of credits to his name, according to IMDb, but what a wimpy,
  character-less, uninteresting washout he is! Was Blake going for
  a Harold Lloyd lookalike? He got one, but there's nothing else to
  recommend him. He looks like a Clark Kent without the Superman
  suit underneath. The other flaw is the length. Even the opening
  credits (using a deFreiling/Patie ripoff style) go on forever.
  But the slapstick, which is masterful as always (Blake having
  been raised on or at least heavily influenced by silent comedies,
  especially those of Laurel &amp;amp; Hardy)...my God, does he
  stretch things out here! The cameos are the saving grace,
  especially Roger Moore's. His vocal impersonation of Clousseau is
  perfect. Why didn't he dub the voice for Clousseau in the
  concurrently filmed TRAIL OF THE PINK PANTHER? Whoever did that
  voiceover sounded like Sellers on helium! It's sad to see our
  icons age, especially Burt Kwouk, who looks and sounds awfully
  tired. David Niven looks as close to death as he actually was.
  Rich Little's uncredited overdubbing was beautifully done: subtle
  and convincing. Herbert Lom's Dreyfuss got bigger and more
  ridiculous in each successive film. And Harvey Korman's Prof.
  Balls is delightful. The entire scene in his shop is a stitch.
  No, there will never be another Sellers (and I have no intention
  of seeing the new film with Steve Martin). But Blake could have
  done better with his stopgaps</Text>

  <Text category="book">I'm the sort of guy who has a bit of trouble
  adapting to normal life. I'm still bemused and puzzled the
  mechanics of toilet-flushing. My wife (may she rest in peace)
  bought me this book as an anniversary present last month before
  she was tragically torn apart by a rabid pack of alligators at a
  Wyoming nature preserve. Anyway, life moves on. Much to my
  disappointment this book did not teach me everything I should
  know how to do. "But Fred," you might be saying (and I'll be
  saying "Fred isn't my name, idiot!"), "how do you know what you
  should know if you don't know what it is to begin with?" Ah,
  well, let me explain. See, if Tchikavoslky taught me one thought,
  it was this: I know nothing. So it is with this deep insight into
  my own mind that I came up with the following Things I Should
  Know, based on what I currently do NOT know: 1. How to start a
  hurricane. This is very important. 2. How to kill a man with a
  toothpick. What if you met a hitman at a fancy restaurant and
  found out your were his next victim? Scary. 3. How to run a
  nuclear powerplant with a one-man army. I don't want to be the
  next Homer Simpson! 4. How to raise children. I've raised ten and
  still haven't figured out what a diaper is. 5. What a diaper is.
  I don't know, my wife used to talk about them a lot. 6. How to
  drive. Sure, technically we're supposed to learn how BEFORE we
  get our driver's licenses, but like many people, I just got a
  fake one when I was 12 and have been driving since then. I've
  been in over three hundred vehicular accidents and been charged
  with five counts of manslaughter, so I figured it might be good
  to learn how to drive. 7. How to stalk a celebrity. You just
  never know. 8. How to put on underwear without leaving stain
  marks. You fellas know what I'm saying! 9. How to make coffee.
  People ask me to all the time, and because I don't know how, I
  just take some warm water and pour mud in. Thankfully no one's
  noticed my inadequacies yet, but I'm sure soon enough they will,
  after another person dies of food poisoning and internal
  infection. 10. How to kill yourself. I don't want the aliens to
  get anything out of me when I'm taken hostage. I saw it in that
  Tom Cruise movie, and it was sure scary! So with these things in
  mind, I'm severely disappointed by this book, and feel it is
  mis-marketed and stupid. Please, Barbet Schroeder (or whoever the
  author was), write a better book next time</Text>

  It works well for carrying the unit and all the games he has for

  It is not nearly padded enough to be carrying a hand held gaming
  unit of any sort. My son likes to take his L-Max to school with
  him for mornings before school begins. I place it in the carrying
  case and then place the carrying case inside of his backpack to
  give it some extra cushioning. If I had known how little padding
  there was in this particular carrying case I probably wouldn't
  have bought it. There is a carrying case out for the Nintendo Wii
  that is similar in style but much more padded. I almost purchased
  it but then thought that I should get something designed for the

  case for the Wii. It might have been a little big but the extra
  padding would have made up for it. Overall, it is not a bad

  <Text category="dvd">In 1973, director Nicholas Roeg took a Daphne
  Du Maurier story about a strained family situation, added a child
  in a red coat and some superlative direction, cast wonderful,
  talented actors such as Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie, and
  produced a seminal and classic piece of seventies horror, the
  unmissable "Don't Look Now". Six years later, Cronenberg -
  obviously, oh so obviously having been influenced by the starkly
  pared-down imagery and understated elegance of the Roeg picture -
  decided to put his own markedly different spin on a terribly
  similar theme, with disasterously boring results. To synopsise
  the plot: Frank Carveth's estranged wife is crazy, and undergoing
  unconventional therapy at her psychiatrist's controversial
  institute. Suspecting her of abusing their daughter, he removes
  her from his wife's care, to the strenuous objections of her
  shrink. Several people connected to wifey's emotionally crippling
  past begin to show up dead, and Carveth finds himself fighting to
  save his daughter from her crazy mother's 'other' set of kids. So
  it's David Cronenberg. So what? Performances and direction, as
  well as screenplay, are all simply mundane. There's barely a
  shred of the sleek, polished talent we have come to recognise as
  David Cronenberg, and what we have instead is a sort of mishmash
  of some of the better aspects from classic American horror
  movies, as seen through the obviously tired eyes of the
  writer/director. It's almost got the sense of isolation of 'The
  Shining', but there are too many incidental characters. It's
  almost got the same sense of murder-by-numbers as 'Hallowe'en',
  but lacks the decisive action of that movie. It's close to the
  stark imagery and sense of motherhood-gone-awry as 'Carrie' (and
  even the lead actress bears a striking resemblance to Piper
  Laurie!), but Samantha Eggar's performance is too overblown.
  Makeup effects, too, are over-ambitious for the time and fail to
  create any sense of impact or drama, in that they just look
  silly. Of course, you could say the same for 'The Exorcist',
  nowadays, but where that film still has the incredible strength
  of Ellen Burstyn's and Linda Blair's performances, all 'The
  Brood' has to go on is some deformed alien-figures that hiss a
  lot. It's not good. In short, where a movie matters most, 'The
  Brood' fails wholly to deliver, instead regaling us with 90 or so
  minutes of unfulfilling cinema. A note on the subtext: It's
  difficult to feel any sort of respect for the social commentary
  contained herein. Sure, topics like the state of the Nuclear
  Family and the negative effects of a Mother's love are riveting
  things, when handled properly. Unfortunately, when the package
  and presentation are so obviously hollow and overdone, who could
  care less about subtext? I couldn't.</Text>
  <Text category="book">Do you know how clever Alan Trachtenberg is? I
  mean, do you really, really know?! Because if not, this book is
  for you. Trachtenberg's book is only superficially about Indians
  or Americans, it is about the obscure conections he can draw
  between unrelated things--because he is very clever, you know. In
  so far as this book has a thesis, that it is it</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">First of all, this is NOT the worst movie ever
  made, nor even the worst movie ever made that was given a budget
  and some name stars. The worst movie ever made was "Autumn in New
  York", but that is a different review. No, this not a great
  movie, but it is very interesting. And for once, thank God, it
  doesn't end with everything tied up in a pretty Hollywood bow
  where everthing works out for everyone. It has a gritty sort of
  realism that transcends the walk through performances of the
  stars of the movie. And the scenery works well for the overall
  feel of the movie, bleak. More interestingly for me and others of
  my generation who grew up with the brat pack, this marked the end
  of these actors forays into trying to do the teenager thing. For
  Molly Ringwald, she didn't do anything of note again until "The
  Stand" six years later, and for Andrew McCarthy, well it could be
  argued that he still hasn't starred in anything of note again
  (although he probably made some money from "Weekend at Bernies" I
  &amp;amp; II). Anyway, probably better to rent than buy, I am
  only buying it to complete my 80's collection.</Text>
  <Text category="book">I picked up this volume because its title
  suggested that it would encourage hands-on science activities
  that are essential to good teaching and effective learning.
  Unfortunately, I discovered on reading it that the author
  combines a deep antagonism for the scientific
  &amp;amp;quot;establishment&amp;amp;quot; with credulity for
  numerous fringe ideas. The first experiment that he suggests
  tests the hypothesis that your pet uses psychic powers to tell
  when you'll be home for dinner! Sheldrake frequently presents
  anecdotes as &amp;amp;quot;evidence&amp;amp;quot;. The
  &amp;amp;quot;do it yourself&amp;amp;quot; promise of the title
  is broken for the reader who doesn't intend to begin raising
  homing pidgeons or doesn't happen to work in a laboratory capable
  of measuring the physical constants (such as the speed of light)
  to nine significant figures. Far too few cautions about the
  pitfalls of psychic research are given (in chapters about the
  feeling of being stared at, or
  &amp;amp;quot;feeling&amp;amp;quot; the touch of a severed limb).
  Despite the nearly fatal flaws of the book, I liked a part of its
  message, that important science can still be done by amateurs.
  That's about the only aspect of this book that is
  commendable</Text>

  <Text category="music">Before you get all worked up, let me say that
  he has a voice, but he really doesn't have a style. he sings
  songs way too straight, he makes even Bobby Short sound like an
  improviser! He also doesn't seem to be in touch with his
  masculine side, his vocie is very, well if ying is male, and yang
  is female, he sounds very yang. He needs to take some liberties
  with the songs he sings and then he won't sound so obnoxious,
  then he needs to take some vocal lessons and try to bring out the
  ying(masculine side) in his voice. He needs to hear a few Billy
  Eckstine lp's. I don't think he can change but here's hoping
  he'll take my advice. As far as you buying this cd it is your
  decision, this is just my honest opinion</Text>
  <Text category="music">Anna Netrebko's I Puritani selections are way
  below the art and skill of Callas, Sills, Sutherland, Caballe,
  and Gencer. She has no passion, no trills, no high notes that are
  deep and rich. Her best is in the Russian repertoire and
  possibley some undemanding Mozart. Her broadcast from the Met
  Live of the I Puritani was alright, but scooping, avoidance of
  repetitions, running through passages like a locomotive, and an
  ending that would have brought the wrath of most opera houses in
  the world..scooping again, and a tight awful sounding high note.
  The same tentativenes is also here on this CD.She should know
  this. Her beauty and acting and allure are what interest the
  masses, not the voice, which is forgiven everything. Too bad; she
  could be a lovely Tatyana some day.Also too, the Traviata is not
  that great; Anna Moffo , Renee Fleming, M. Caballe, and of course
  Maria Callas..Listen to these and hear the difference</Text>
  <Text category="music">Some of the songs here are good, most notably
  "Never Be Forgotten".....beautiful. I heard this song on the
  radio and I thought it was Faith Hill or Martina McBride singing.
  Herein lies the problem. The song is good, the voice is good. But
  if she sounds like Faith or Martina, there's no distinction to
  set her off from the rest of the pack out there. Add to this that
  this is mostly bubble-gum pop and not country....there's really
  nothing that stands out here. Why are recording companies giving
  contracts to people who sound like everybody else out there?
  That's the question.</Text>
  <Text category="book">I picked this up because it's considered a
  classic and I knew it had been made into a movie. I tend to think
  that if a book is made into a movie, then the book must be pretty
  good. Not so with Howard's End. The plot in Howard's End doesn't
  progress much outside of an early death and later marraige. You
  have to have some interest in the characters, but they just
  weren't very believeable. None of characters convinced me that
  they could be people from the real world. I kept waiting for
  someone to say anything that might border on being interesting,
  but everyone babbles on and on about nothing of any substance.
  The story is clearly dated and doesn't hold up well so many years
  later. Living in today's world, it's hard to understand what
  attracted Margaret to Henry. There definately is an audience for
  this book. I'm just not a part of it</Text>
  <Text category="book">Seems amidst the turbulence and brouhaha of
  that James Frey fiasco, anybody who now pens their auto-bios have
  to first be as famous and beloved as Billy Crystal. But then they
  can only put out the cotton-candy Coney Island fluff as '700
  Sundays' is. Granted, the book is based on Crystal's
  highly-praised Tony Award winning theatrical performance about
  time with his father and relatives when growing up during the 50s
  et al. But it's nothing more than an appetizer to fill in and/or
  tide one over during the day and night Kaddish. Yet in ripping a
  page out of Billy's book, it's not hard to imagine how that
  rapid-fire exchange between him and his agent went. It probably
  went something like: "Hey, bubby, how about writing a book
  talking about your 700 Sundays with your pop?" "Well, I'm not a
  writer per se. I just jot down a few notes here and there, and
  then go out and perform the material on stage." "So here's a few
  blank pages of paper; write down what you have." "It'll only be
  45 maybe 50 pages at most; and it sounds and looks much better
  than it reads." "Don't worry, bubby, I know people who know
  people who...you get the idea...at the publishers. Here's their
  recipe: They'll take your 50 wholesale pages and spread `em out
  across 180 retail pages. 'How?' may you ask! Well, they'll cut
  `em in half, then cut `em in half again. And using big ink
  letters so even grandmas can read it without their glasses;
  surround it by a whole lot of white space; toss in some pictures
  at different angles from your family album -- Slap it all
  together between two hardcovers...It'll be just fine." "Yes,
  but..." "Don't worry. Consider it like a vintage bottle of Mogen
  David 20/20 wine, aged a few months before it makes it to the
  shelves of your favorite corner liquor store hangout. In this
  case, the local bookstores. Oh, and make sure you give `em just
  enough to whet their taste buds; leave `em wanting more and
  thirsty for more. People'll drink it up." "Yes, but..." "Don't
  worry, Face. Everybody loves ya. Just toss in a few tidbits from
  your routines about Satchmo and Mantle, you'll be all right.
  Don't forget now, we've got the sequels all lined up for ya too.
  Y'know `700 Mondays;' then `700 Tuesdays' and so on. Yes'sir, I
  can see it all now: We've got the lock on all those 700 days of
  the week shtick. Oh, and we'll do some holiday editions too,
  starting with `700 Hanukkahs!' "You're still friends with that
  kid, Adam Sandler, back from your SNL days, aren't ya?! Yes, so
  we'll get you and him together to come up with new lyrics to that
  Hanukkah song of his. It'll be a great collaboration. It's good
  to pass down the ladder to them other kids climbing up once
  you've made it. Y'know God blesses and doesn't forget those
  things by them who do. Yes, ok, so we'll go ahead from there and
  do `700 Passovers!' "And it'll be an annual event too, dont'cha
  know. Just think, when people see Chuck Heston...may God keep a
  special place in heaven for him...when people see Chuck Heston
  and The Ten Commandments, they'll be thinking about you too,
  Billy. Yes'sir, we'll have em crying and laughing every year on
  Passover, you'll see. "Oh, and holy of holies, out of the deal
  we'll get `700 Yom Kippurs!' You'll see. But this will be only
  for our people, Billy, you understand. So you might have to dig
  deep to get material for it. But that's what authors do, they dig
  deep. But you already knew that, right? Can you dig it, man? I
  knew that you could. "Yes, but..." "Don't worry, Face, everybody
  loves ya! Your books don't have to be earth-shattering or
  thought-provoking or anything like that. But hey listen, with a
  book deal, a books-on-tape deal, and who knows even a movie deal,
  we'll turn your little leaden bits into golden nuggets. Mark my
  words we will. "And say, since you haven't had a hit movie in
  awhile...no offense...we're going to get Martin Scorsese to
  produce and direct your life story. Yes, it'll be something like
  'Pinch Me I'm Still Jewish: The Billy Crystal Story' in
  widescreen and all that jazz. It's what everybody in Hollywood's
  doing right now. Yeah, no use waiting until your dying or dead
  already, Billy - God forbid. No, siree, bubby!! "So Scorsese will
  do the movie on the cheap, because God knows the man deserves an
  Oscar already. You know it, I know it, we all know it, Billy. And
  not just an honorary or lifetime achievement either, but the
  really big one, see! And just imagine, wouldn't it be something
  if you were hosting the awards ceremony and handed Marty his own
  Oscar?! Yes, well, we can schmooze on about all this stuff later.
  "But for now, with the books and everything, you'll be a one-man
  franchise, yes you will! You'll be on the New York Times Best
  Seller List from now until forever! It'll be great!!" "Yes,
  but..." "Oh and well, I didn't want to say anything just yet,
  but, okay, here goes: There might be plans to expand everything
  too! Listen, bubby, I know somebody who knows somebody who...you
  get the idea...over at the networks. "We can do a little Chris
  Rock in the neighborhood sort of thing. We'll put a kid who looks
  and acts like you - about as tall as you - into the neighborhood
  that you and your family lived in, see. "And it's going to be a
  period piece too! We'll introduce all the new kids to the stars
  of yesteryear -- y'know, Cantor, Jolson, Jessel, Durante! Throw
  in some goniffs and shiksas that the cast can work off of every
  week -- It'll be fun! "Chris Rock is great. But you can be
  greater too. Listen, Face, we'll make it a celebration. Something
  like 'Growing up Mazel Tov!' Maybe we get 700 shows out of it.
  Maybe less, maybe more, but people will still love it anyway.
  You'll see!" "Yes, but, well, I'm not really a writer/author. I'm
  an entertainer, so why would I want to do any of this?" "We could
  make a couple of dollars!" "Okay. I'm in!" And so it went and so
  it goes. Final analysis: A So Not Looking Mahvelous, Better Luck

  <Text category="dvd">A review by the students in ENT 201, Insects
  on Film (Clemson University, Clemson, SC) Spring 2005 When better
  to meet your new man than while saving the world from GIANT
  radioactive grasshoppers! That's what happened to Audrey Ames in
  Beginning of the End. The black and white movie, produced in
  1957, takes place in a small Illinois town called Ludlow, near
  the big city of Chicago. The main character, Audrey, is a
  persistent reporter who discovers a new and interesting story on
  her way to write about a lackluster flying demonstration. On her
  way to the flying demo, she is stopped at a roadblock in the town
  of Ludlow, Illinois. It seems that the town has been mysteriously
  destroyed overnight! Following a lead, Audrey goes to the U.S.
  Department of Agriculture and meets with the project director
  named Dr. Ed Wainwright in order to find out more about what
  happened. Dr. Wainwright tells Audrey about a wheat factory that
  was demolished in the same area before the destruction of Ludlow.
  Ed, Audrey and Ed's co-worker, Frank, go to investigate the
  abandoned grain bins. While they are there, a locust comes from
  the woods and eats Ed's co-worker. They finally realize what is
  destroying the towns and eating the people-although it's a little
  too late for poor Frank Johnson. Determined to resolve the
  problem, the military enlists the help of Dr. Wainwright, who
  tries to find a sound frequency that mimics the sound
  grasshoppers make before they attack. The viewer of this film
  will be held in utter suspense, until, at a climatic moment, Dr.
  Wainwright discovers the right frequency and saves the city of
  Chicago from the military's impending drop of an atom bomb. The
  sound is broadcast from a boat in a lake outside of Chicago and
  the sound attracts the grasshoppers to the lake. As the
  grasshoppers follow the luring sound, they eventually end up in
  the lake where they meet a watery death. The city of Chicago is
  safe and everyone lives happily ever after (except, sadly, those
  who were eaten alive by the radioactive grasshoppers). While this
  movie has extremely entertaining moments, such as when the
  grasshoppers scale the skyscrapers of Chicago looking for
  food-the movie, in general, is a B attempt at science fiction.
  Also, the movie was produced during the 1950s, resulting in
  minimal attempts at realistic special effects. The special
  effects are entertaining at best and add humor more than
  substance to the movie. The viewer also might be left with
  several questions after watching this movie-like why can't the
  National Guard protect the citizens from grasshoppers? Or, why is
  it more funny than tragic when Dr. Wainwright's deaf/mute
  assistance gets eaten alive by a grasshopper? On a scientific or
  scholarly level, the movie has several errors. The most important
  error, in the entomological sense, is the noise that the
  grasshoppers make throughout the movie. To make the noise that
  they did in the movie, they would need wings. In the movie
  though, the characters say that the grasshoppers could not fly
  because they didn't have wings. Also, the scientist indicates
  that the giant vegetables were produced through radioactivity,
  which allows for photosynthesis to occur both day and night. For
  photosynthesis to occur, light must be present, thus raising the
  question of how the vegetables could continue to expand during
  the darkness of night. The inability of the grasshoppers to burn
  in the fires set by the military reflects an error as well. In
  reality, grasshoppers are highly flammable because of their
  wax-like coating. Finally, the plot as a whole is completely
  unrealistic and so bizarre that the movie should be placed in the
  comedy (opposed to science fiction) genre. While Clemson
  University research may have led to the evacuation of mole
  crickets from golf course greens, using technological concepts
  similar to those presented in the movie, the likelihood that
  radioactive grasshoppers would eat hundreds of people is
  improbable. Beginning of the End is an amusing movie to watch!
  The acting is traditional of the sci-fi movies of the era. The
  special effects are mediocre, but the humor, in retrospect, is
  delightful. If you are a fan of cheesy sci-fi suspense movies,
  give this flick a try! You will not be disappointed. Who
  knows-maybe you'll learn something that could save the world the
  next time we are attacked by radioactive BUGS</Text>

  <Text category="toys_games">My son (now 4) loves cars, so when I saw this
  bed frame, I thought this is it! Well, looks can fool you. I also
  read many glowing reviews about this bed frame, so I was
  confident that this was a MUST buy. But after using it for a
  while (1 year now), I am very disappointed. If I would buy
  another bed frame, this one would not be in my shopping list.
  What I and all my family don't like about this frame : 1. The
  front end of the car frame is shaped like a sports car, so people
  hit that protruding part all the time when walking in the room,
  making people falter sometimes. 2. Since it is made of plastic,
  it gets really cold, and it really feels terrible. I don't know
  why it is damn cold all the time. 3. I had to exchange the
  regular-height box spring for a half-height one, because the
  regular-height box spring would be too high and the sides of the
  bed frame would not provide adequate protection against falling.
  4. So many toys and things fall between the mattress and the bed
  frame. I have to lift the damn mattress and then go into the car
  frame to pick up all the junk that my son loves to shove into the
  little openings. 5. I think the bed frame takes up way too much
  space for a twin sized bed. It is waste of space. 6. My son was
  disappointed that the wheels don't spin. And I think he has a
  point, since this bed frame costs so much. My son now don't even
  think it's a cool thing. Well, he stopped liking the bed only
  after a few days. 7. The head part of the bed is also plastic,
  and for some reason, your head can go under that plastic, because
  that head part comes over the mattress. It is quite annoying, and
  we had to put another pillow to cover that part of the frame. And
  you can't even use it as a shelf since it is not flat. Dolls and
  little toys that we put up there would slide down to hit our son
  or slide to the sides and fall into the corner where there is a
  big opening between the walls and the car frame. 8. Again, it is
  very very cold, and it really feels terrible when you want to
  sleep at night and everything around you is so cold and hard.
  This is a miserable bed, and I feel bad that I bought this
  horrible bed for my loving son. We are gonna sell it for 100
  dollars (we hope) in the summer. The only reason for giving 2
  stars is because, it is very solid</Text>

  he's told, and he soon finds himself embroiled in a nightmarish
  sequence of events. Directed by Mateo Gil, "Nobody Knows
  Anything" opens with a scene of a man stabbed to death with a
  crucifix through his heart, and this scene is one of the ideas
  that feeds the notion you are about to see some sort of horror
  film with religious overtones, but the plot moves away from the
  horror aspect into straight thriller territory. The film--which
  owes much of its style to American thrillers--is slickly
  produced, and the exotic settings of the sights and sounds of
  Seville help, but the preposterous plot with its huge gaps in
  logic and implausibility ultimately left this viewer disappointed
  and feeling a bit cheated by the experience. I was intrigued at
  first by the film and drawn into the plot. However, once the plot
  and the mystery aspect became clear (and I can't give away too
  much here), the film became silly and trite. There's little
  character development--our hero is a flat, dull passive
  character, and the film's emphasis is on the thrill aspect. A
  slick product that is ultimately empty and really ridiculous,
  this film is in Spanish with English
  subtitles--displacedhuma</Text>

  <Text category="book">Main Pro: an additional unbiased source of
  information in an area where there is not nearly enough Main Con:
  too few products reviewed As a first time mom (and a compulsive
  researcher) I found this book most helpful as a cross reference
  with other sources (Baby Bargains, Girlfriend's Guide to Baby
  Gear, and reviews in babycenter and at amazon). I will say though
  that I found myself trusting the advice of Alan and Denise Fields
  and of Vicki Lovine more than that of the authors of this book.
  When reading through BB Bargains and Girlfriends Guide I felt
  more keenly that the products were being judged by real parents
  who thought about parents' needs; Consumer Reports seemed a
  little less thoughtful and definately less comprehensive. Getting
  ready for a baby is a behemoth task. The sheer amount of stuff
  you need-- clothing, bedding, furniture, strollers, car seats,
  feeding devices, toys-- and the myriad of choices that exist for
  each item can be very overwhelming. And because there are so many
  crib manufacturers, stroller makers, etc, no single superstore
  like BBRUS or Target can carry all of the "major" brands. It
  would be impossible to register at any one of these stores using
  only the recommendations of Consumer Reports' book. Now perhaps
  not everyone enters parenthood quite as clueless as I was about
  baby gear. And if you have friends and family who can share
  enough information with you (and better yet stuff!) about these
  products, then you probably don't need any of these books. But if
  you are the kind of person who wants to know all of your options
  and who works to get the most for her or his money, you'll need
  more than this book.</Text>

  <Text category="toys_games">If you want my review in a nutshell, here it
  is: Two Defective Rise &amp;amp; Shine Lamps. One Call to
  Verilux. Verilux Refuses to Help. If you wish to learn how this
  sorry state of affairs came to pass, read on. My Verilux Product
  Experience: I exchanged my first Verilux Rise and Shine Natural
  Alarm Clock &amp;amp; Bedside Lamp due to a non-functional
  internal speaker, ostensibly from loose wires that were shaken
  loose during shipping (if I am to understand the Verilux' company
  president's response to a similar defect report in these
  reviews). The good news: The speaker in the second unit now
  works. And contrary to some of the other reviewers I feel the
  Mylar speaker sounds quite good -- although dual stereo speakers
  would have been an even better choice (with a line-in jack for CD
  player or iPod). The bad: Despite the jumbo LCD display that
  might lead you to assume that the AM/FM tuner is digital, the
  radio is completely analog. The station IDs are printed in
  roughly 7-point type on the tuning dial instead -- small enough
  that some owners will need their glasses AND a magnifying glass
  to select a radio station. By contrast, I own an alarm clock by
  Conair with a similar analog tuner, with the exception that it
  uses roughly 8-point LCD digits to represent the radio frequency
  in the lower right-hand corner of the backlit LCD display. On
  Verilux' comparatively enormous LCD, I am left to wonder why the
  design team failed to consider that option. An analog tuner
  without a station display is something I expect from a $15
  drugstore alarm clock, but not from a product of this type, which
  is otherwise very well thought out. Unfortunately, due to an
  apparent flaw in the shade and/or the lamp itself, the shade on
  my replacement lamp -- the lamp I received from the store in
  exchange -- won't sit straight! One can remove the shade, look at
  the lamp on a level surface, and see the lamp "shelf" slope
  downward such that the shade itself also is similarly slanted!
  Making the situation worse, the lampshade is also slightly off
  insofar as the ring is not centered. There are three metal
  supports attached at the top of the shade that are bent downward
  and welded to a ring that sits about half way down (as typical of
  most lampshades). The ring, in turn, sits on the lamp body (or
  shelf). The whole assembly is cockeyed, including the socket into
  which the bulb sets (at a VERY obvious angle)! Cosmetically
  speaking, there are also problems that are surprising to see in a
  product of this type. Whereas the first lamp I purchased has a
  very prominent nick in the plastic edge alongside the LCD panel,
  the replacement lamp has a scratch in the ivory plastic lamp body
  about an inch below the shade shelf, and it, too, must have been
  obtained in manufacturing. As for the shade itself, it came out
  of the plastic wrap with a beige blemish, roughly 3/4", that
  looks like a pale stain against the bright white linen. So while
  the second lamp did not have a DOA speaker, I apparently traded
  one problem in for another. Worse, the lamp appears lopsided even
  from the opposite side of the room (and would probably appear
  that way from down the street if I were to set it on the curb).
  In short, the Verilux Rise &amp;amp; Shine lamp is just not up to
  the quality that the price/warranty suggests. And in case you are
  wondering if this might have been "gray market" merchandise, it
  wasn't. I purchased my Rise &amp;amp; Shine lamp straight out of
  a high-end, authorized retail store, new-in-box. The AM/FM clock
  radio paired to the sunrise-simulating full-spectrum light,
  finished off by the eight high-quality digital nature sounds --
  contained in a space-saving design roughly 6.5" wide at the base
  and 20" tall -- makes for an outstanding combination and concept.
  For this reason, I hope Verilux will continue to refine the Rise
  and Shine model, particularly where quality control is concerned.
  Given that I am a gadget fan, and someone who has rated products
  1/5th the price of this lamp very highly, it should be understood
  that I really wanted to give this a positive review. But two duds
  in a row? IRONY The Rise &amp;amp; Shine user manual emphatically
  instructs consumers to contact Verilux directly instead of
  returning defective products to the retailer. Given that my
  replacement lamp is also defective, I followed these
  instructions. But in reality, Verilux wants defective merchandise
  to become the retailers' problem, not theirs (as per the
  instruction I received to make a THIRD 40-mile trip back to the
  store where I purchased it). Conclusion? VERILUX DOESN'T BACK
  THEIR WARRANTY (in my experience/opinion). Nor, apparently, does
  Verilux care what kind of impression they leave on first-time
  customers. So if you think the impressive three-year warranty
  will help you if something should go wrong, consider what
  happened less than 72 hours into my ownership experience. And
  believe me, there was no rudeness involved to provoke this kind
  of reaction on the part of Verilux' customer service department,
  either. What Verilux has apparently forgotten is that this is the
  age of the Internet. As it so happens, I supplement my income
  writing product reviews for Websites. In fact, I am a writer by
  training/trade. Translation: Verilux chose the wrong customer to
  let down. I have no intention of smearing Verilux' reputation --
  unless telling the truth and nothing but the truth about my
  experience qualifies as such. Would I recommend this product to a
  friend? Yesterday I might have said yes, chalking up the
  non-operative speaker in the first lamp to a fluke. Today,
  coupled with the fact that Verilux seemingly does not wish to
  stand behind their products even when it would take a mere
  lampshade to keep a customer happy, my answer is a resounding NO.
  Should anyone at Verilux read my review, I wish to close with
  this thought: I could have learned to live with the cosmetic
  problems I noted, but a ~$5 lampshade, to replace the one that
  was blemished right out of the box -- and doesn't sit straight,
  to boot -- is that not worth keeping a first-time customer
  happy?</Text>

  <Text category="book">"The Burning" was a big letdown after reading
  Bentley Little's masterful book, "Dispatch". I seriously
  considered that this book might be written by someone else while
  Bentley was ill and couldn't write. Who knows. I love this guy
  and can't tell you how disappointed I was. While one of the top 5
  horror writers working today, Bentley Little seems to be hit or
  miss with his stories. I simply just did not enjoy reading this
  new release. It seemed that he was throwing way too much random
  horror at the reader and hoping some of it would stick. And, with
  everything he was trying to do, none of it - not one moment - was
  scary! Shadow creatures performing random oral sex, creeping
  fungus, talking voices in the microwave, deformed goblins peering
  in windows, skeletons climbing out of mud pits, tunnels filled
  with moving corpses, and a runaway ghost train crashing into the
  White House was just too silly. It reminded me of his previous
  work, "The Return", another disappointment containing silly,
  bizarre, and unrealistic situations. The scenes of horror during
  the first third of the book were described during the daytime
  hours and lost its scare value, suspense, and atmospheric
  quality. The book had many problems that pulled me out of the
  story. One of those problems was how ridiculous it was that the
  police would allow a field trip to a tunnel of bodies that had
  just been discovered earlier that same day. Bentley needs to do
  what he does best, which is to come up with a gimmick, focus
  everything on that single idea, and continue to build suspense
  around it using his original and obsessed style of storytelling.
  It worked with "The Store", "The Association", "The Policy", and
  "Dispatch", just to name a few. Let's hope he gets back on track
  with his next book.</Text>

  theatrical elements rather than focusing on their metal music.
  The vocals tend to be oversung, or drowned out by the chaos in

  dissappointed with the widescreen DVD. Those who created it did
  not use the original film, but chopped top and bottom from the
  fullscreen VHS version. There are many instances when this is
  evident, but the most glaring is the scene in the back yard of
  the Lovell house after the walk on the moon when Jim says,
  &amp;amp;quot;I want to go back there&amp;amp;quot;. When the
  scene opens, he is cut off at mid-thigh and you never see below

  'elders' is painfully numbing, choppy, and stilted. And the
  directing drove me crazy, especially since M. Night...insists on
  filming group scenes as is he was just passing through, or
  following them without ever bothering with close-ups. These
  scenes make me feel like they were done by an amateur filmmaker
  with a his first video camera. If you like the back of William
  Hurt's head, you'll get plenty of it in this film, the camera
  seems to avoid his face like the plague; which is too bad, since
  when he finally has a good speech, we are deprived of the anger I
  imagine was in his eyes. I agree with others, I would have worked
  better as a 30 minute Twilight Zone episode. Rent it first before

  Unfortunately, this recording comes across like sugar poured on

  listening to Hawaiian strumming-which is at least half of it-this
  is the recording for you. (In fairness, track 15, "Style O
  Blues," and track 20, "New Steal," are wonderful. They have some
  drive and get-up-and-go.) I also own Tone Poems I, which Grisman
  did with flatpicker extraodinaire Tony Rice. That recording is
  also mostly a lightweight. I play mandolin and fiddle, and
  recognize David Grisman as the world's master with the mando. I
  also appreciate what he's doing with his Acoustic Disc recording
  label. These days, however, he seems to be better off when other
  musicians are running the show. The recent recordings with Vasser
  Clements and Old and in the Gray are great. "Hold On, We're
  Stummin'," with Sam Bush,is the best new mandolin record I've
  heard. Buy it and go to acoustic heaven! For my hard-earned
  money, however, the Tone Poems CDs have turned out to be an
  expensive set of matching drink coasters. I just know that
  musicians of this caliber, playing instruments of this quality,
  could have given us a better selection of music.</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">I just watched this movie version of the
  classic childrens' book with my wife. Here are my gut
  impressions: First, very little is true to the book. That's not
  really a gut impression. That's the impression I got hearing my
  wife say "That's not in the book...that's not in the book..."
  Actually this movie is more like a computer animation demo than a
  vehicle for story telling. It makes for beautiful stills and
  pictures, and those made me want to see the movie. I expected a
  heart warming Christmas story, and what I got was about an hour
  of frantic scenes of out-of-control railroad and other technology
  animated like never before with just enough pauses betwen them to
  remind me why I'm watching. You get to see... A kid chasing a
  ticket through a train, A kid chasing a ticket over the roof of a
  train, A ticket making its way through the forest -- Rube
  Goldberg style -- back to the train, (Forty minutes into this
  movie and one girl's train ticket is the star of the show!) OK,
  the ticket sub plot is resolved and we have... A train sliding
  out of control on the ice, A train trying to outrun cracks on the
  ice, A train going full throttle out of control and racing up and
  down mountain valleys like a roller coaster (fans of the "coaster
  tycoon" series of computer games will feel right at home) until
  finally it arrives at the North Pole. Then, the train car with
  the central character kids gets detached so we have... A train
  car running out of control through Santa's village, Kids getting
  lost in the Christmas present manufacturing plant and falling
  through the chutes and machinery of the factory, and then... Kids
  getting lost in a bag of presents that is taken by a flying
  machine to Santa's sled launching pad where the star at the top
  of the tree is dislodged and nearly impales an innocent elf. Ho
  ho ho. At least let me have a joystick and a couple of buttons so
  I can help these kids out! It's like a computer animated train
  wreck in fast motion. You know it's awful but you can't look
  away! And, you'd better think twice before letting any very young
  children see this. It could be very frightening on a big screen
  with the volume turned up. My wife and I were going to watch it
  with our three and six year old sons, and we were very glad that
  we didn't. So, what could have been a classic, enduring, and
  endearing compliment to a classic childrens' Christmas story is
  little more than a great line for some computer animator to have
  on his or her resume. Two thirds of this movie is devoted to
  stuff that doesn't advance the story or develop the characters
  one bit. Whatever a "character driven" story is, this is the
  opposite. Never have I seen so many rendered pixels doing so much
  and accomplishing so little. I'd rather set up my old American
  Flyer electric trains and let them run around the tree while I
  read the book to my kids.</Text>

  listening to the album. Unlike many other Altan fans, I view
  Maireads singing as the weakest part of the groups appeal despite
  their having chosen some excellent songs over the course of their
  recording career. The problem is that on this album they
  emphasize her singing to the almost total exclusion of their
  instrumentals which was what attracted me to the group in the
  first place. And the few instrumentals they do play are played
  with no spirit almost like &amp;amp;quot;well I guess we have to
  put a few instrumentals on&amp;amp;quot; kind of effort. I'm
  sorry, but she has a thin voice and is frequently shrill and
  off-key on many of their songs. She is however an excellent
  fiddler and that with the superb abilities of the other members
  and inspired arrangements made them for me the top Irish folk
  group. Alas they have decided to stress her poor-to-mediocre

  <Text category="health">Wow 5 blades instead of three? Who would have
  thought of that? I smell noble price here! Don't let the great
  cosmetic design fool you. It turned out to be the same thing but
  with more blades. I was really excited waiting for my brand new
  Fusion Power razor to arrive, I am allergic to shaving so this
  was a big issue for me. After the first shave my hopes were
  destroyed. It turned out to be about the same thing. They even
  mentioned the blades being closer as an improvement, when in
  fact, I think they were forced to do it that way because if not
  they would have ended up with a huge cartridge that would not fit
  the contours of the face. The only obvious new feature is the
  trimmer, which is only that, a feature, and not a real technical
  advance. I hope that someday these companies start to invest a
  part of the income they get from the overpriced cartridges in
  research and development, instead of investing it in marketing.
  By the way, my power handle came broken, so I couldn't test this
  feature, although I have had power handles in the past with other
  blades and the difference was minimal. What will be next, let me
  guess, 7 blades? I guess that these guys should really start
  working in something new because the "adding more blades" thing
  is getting exhausted.</Text>

  <Text category="music">I'm a "compleat" Beatlemaniac, and I don't
  mind the political statements at all, but this is a nearly
  unlistenable record that I have a hard time counting as a serious

  had been a 7" single, "Woman is the Nigger of the World," with
  the rest of it just words written in liner notes. After that
  opening track, the remainder is a serious chore to get through.
  It's almost unimaginable that this came out between the excellent
  "Imagine" (1971) and the solid "Mind Games" (1973), but then
  again, John was not consistent, in part surely due to his
  apparent and admirable lack of commitment to being a pop star.
  Love John for the genius he was, his commitment to peace, and the
  great music he made -- it's just that there's barely any of it on

  <Text category="health">I found this product after seeing it lauded on
  The Today Show and it appeared to be a GREAT idea. However, I had
  a lot of difficulty getting the back and strap porting of the bra

  the bras out. I also have to wonder how a larger bra would work,
  considering I'm merely a B cup and it was a tight fit. In theory,
  I think it's an excellent idea. In truth, I think it still needs
  work. Additionally, although the advertisement claims that you
  can put them in the dryer, one out of two of mine opened in the

  <Text category="dvd">With the $70-million that was spent on the
  2005 video-game-inspired film "Doom", you'd think that director
  Andrzej Bartkowiak would have used better lighting so that the
  audience could actually see what was going on more clearly. On
  second thought, given that this predictable film was little more
  than 100 minutes of "shoot the mutants", it's pretty clear that
  Mr. Bartkowiak may have kept the lights dim in a dismal attempt
  to avoid personal embarrassment. As to the film's plot, it can be
  summarized in a single sentence: a group of
  ï¿½ber-soldiers lead by their "Sarge" (played by
  The Rock) travel to Mars to stop a bunch of scientists that have
  inadvertently transformed themselves into flesh-eating mutants
  after injecting a criminal with DNA recovered from ancient
  humanoid fossils found in a Martian archaeological dig. So,
  there's tons of shooting, a lot of screams, gallons of fake blood
  &amp;amp; guts being tossed about, a Martian sewer and a
  teleportation device that looks like a small-scale version of
  "The Sphere". Others who starred in this forgettable rubbish
  include Karl Urban (ï¿½ber-soldier John Grimm) and
  Rosamund Pike (as John Grimm's sister named Sam). Why these two
  actors would stoop so low as to participate in "Doom" defies
  logic. To anyone who actually paid good money to watch this
  1-star film in a theater, you have my deepest sympathy. To anyone
  thinking of purchasing a copy of "Doom" on DVD, please notice
  that there are a ton of used copies available for very a cheap
  price. That alone should tell you how "good" this film is</Text>

  find out my favorite song "Goodnight My Love" was cut short. On
  the CD, it ends with the sax doing a solo then fades
  away....which leaves the song dangling and unfinished!!! On the
  video, this song ends with Art singing "bring you closer to me"
  and the music slowly ends beautifully, correctly. There's a
  version out which was released by Sony in 2003. I don't know if
  this version contains the full song. The Hybrid Label version is

  <Text category="dvd">I respect the message of "The Unexpected
  Legacy of Divorce" but it seems rather odd to call the
  ramifications of divorce "unexpected." Those of us who have been
  through the hell of divorce know full well the problems our
  children face as a result. Staying together for the children is
  one of the most damaging concepts of all times. The author knows
  this and does present it in a way that eases my frustration a
  little bit. I know many people who have divorced and not one was
  due to not being ecstatically happy all the time. They fell apart
  due to abuse, infidelity, and just plain incompatibility. What I
  feel matters most for children is for them to feel loved and
  cared for by their parents. When you have two parents who both
  love and share in the lives of the kids, most hardly notice
  whether or not they live in the same house. When you have a
  parent who refuses to makes the children a priority, who
  constantly disappoints, hurts, and replaces the kids, there will
  be damage, no getting away from it. However, is it better for
  this type of parent to have daily access to the kids, seemingly
  with the other parent's approval? I hardly think so and will
  challenge anyone who differs in opinion. It is impossible for any
  of the children of divorce to know if their lives would have been
  better had their parents stayed married. This is a major flaw in
  the research. I didn't see any statistics for custody or parental
  involvement which makes a huge difference. I don't think divorce
  is the answer for every marital problem but when it happens, you
  have a responsibility to make your children a priority and
  alleviate their fears. When you put your own personal interests
  ahead of the kid's, whether it's divorce or starting a new life
  afterward, kids will suffer. I don't like 'studies' like this,
  they're misleading and potentially damaging.</Text>

  <Text category="book">The author writes a book that does give you a
  mental workout while giving valuable insight into the
  theological/philosophical foundations of the emerging confession.
  There is value in that. I look forward to reading part two, the
  liturgical ideas section. The emerging church is keen on praxis,
  but the theological underpinings of this book in part one reminds
  me of past mistakes within Christendom, which I had hoped we were
  past. Here are some things that I am amazed do not occur to the
  others reviewing this book, which it might help to know: 1.
  Rollins does not think it's possible to really "know" much
  theology with "certainty." In fact, to claim to have religious
  certainty is to hold an "idolatrous" view of God that is more our
  idea of God than really who God is. This is because it is
  virtually impossible to be objective for us humans, and because
  in his view, God was not all that interested in presenting much
  of Himself in any sort of nailed down way. The irony I could not
  miss was the dogmatism with which he himself expresses his own
  views. He is very certain of his interpretations of "perceptive
  thinkers like Nietzsche, Freud, and Marx," Eckhart, Augustine,
  etc... and is very certain that his interpretations of the
  scattered verses from Scripture are correct. I found his use of
  proof texting for his ideas to be really, really, faulty. As I'm
  reading along I kept jotting in the margins all the times what he
  said was a really pretty clear misunderstanding of the New
  Testament. So, be prepared for a frustrating read if you know the
  Bible's basic content. He is certain that no one should be
  certain, but him. Ok, to be fair, he is not certain if
  Christianity is true, and says so on page 44, but he is certain
  that he should not be certain of Christianity. Nor, I guess,
  should you. With his view of "critique of ideology" how can he be
  so selective of what he is certain of. This seems like a
  self-defeating ideology. So strong is his disdain for "knowing"
  with any real certainty that he would do away with apologetics as
  if it were no longer appropriate to try to base our beliefs on
  reason at all. I was reminded of the case Francis Schaeffer made
  quite well regarding those who do not have any reason to believe
  something is true, but who take a leap of faith and believe it
  anyway. Rollins needs to reread his Francis Schaeffer, in my
  opinion. He says the church is not to be about giving answers,
  but helping raise in people: questioning. Indeed, given his
  views, how could he provide answers? This book may look deep. I
  propose, it is merely muddy. 2. He redefines age old terms.
  Orthodoxy is no longer about the content of what one believes,
  but how loosely one holds it. Certainty of revealed truth is
  dangerous, misinformed, idolatrous. Heresy is now a cute little
  thing. It has come of age. He says people will think his views
  undermine Christianity. We are to just take him at his word that
  his views won't do so, but he does not really make affirmations
  to give any reasonable comfort and any one would, I think, see
  the writing on the wall. 3. He seems to think the emerging church
  is the only hope for unity or evangelism in our time among post
  moderns. After reading his views I wonder if it is possible for
  post moderns, those like himself, at least, to even understand
  the gospel. He has not. How can he be a bridge? To be a bridge
  one must have footing on both shores. Christianity IS based on
  real events with real content that has been passed down, not
  without mystery, nor without debate, but in a very real and
  tangible way. he cannot be a bridge to something by changing that
  thing to something else. 4. He is right to be kind to people of
  other religions and to try to learn from them. The problem that
  is huge, and no one seems to notice, is that he seems incapable
  of learning or appreciating the Christians who are in other
  camps. He considers fundamentalists,and by logical extension many
  evangelicals, to be pharisees and the true heretics in his new
  definition of the term, heresy. I kept thinking, what kind of
  "fundamentalists" is he so angry at? He blasts the whole of that
  group and by extension most evangelicals, making generalizations
  that are misleading. Very unobjective. Unkind. Very divisive. Yet
  he thinks only his views can bring unity to Christendom. I can
  see his views bringing unity to all religions, but it will never
  bring unity to Christendom. He seems oblivious to the amazing
  amount of unity that now exists in Christendom. Times have really
  changed in the past 20 years. He is either unaware or has a
  different kind of unity in mind. 5. He makes God hopelessly
  difficult. God wanted, it seems, to speak in a plain brown
  wrapper...the common language of the people, the dust of
  humanity, the lowly donkey ride, the obscure but simple truth of
  the simple gospel. Rollins has wrapped God up in Nietzsche and
  while disdaining "human reason" as the means of knowing God has
  turned the living Christ who said "I am the truth" into an enigma
  of mental gymnastics that is so complex only man could concoct
  it. God's message is simple. It's clear where it needs to be. It
  hints at huge mystery beyond what is stated. Rollins makes it
  nearly all enigma, hinting at some possible truth out there from
  a winking God, who says out of one side of his mouth something is
  important and that we will be held accountable for knowing and
  obeying it, yet Who has been unwilling or incapable, given man's
  weaknesses, or His own lack of communication skills, to
  articulate it in such a way that a person can hold any
  theological content soundly. If, as Tickle says, this is the
  Christianity of the 3rd millenium, then the Chrisitan faith is
  about to become the irrational man's religion, the anything goes
  religion, and following generations will have to deconstruct
  today's extreme and irrational over-reaction to fundamentalism.
  Peter, I can learn some stuff from you, and I'm sure some of my
  perception of what you were trying to say was likely lost in
  transmission. As it stands now I cannot agree with you on several
  points. Your views trouble me. Nothing against you personally.
  Forgive any kind of perceived condescending tone. I hope to enjoy
  the rest of your book much more, though, it will for me be an
  upper story with out a first floor. Regardless, if it inspires
  I'll come back and add a star. hmmm</Text>

  <Text category="health">The idea is fantastic. The fact is I don't
  wake up immediately like BZZZZ--I'm awake. Amazingly I can hit
  the snooze on a regular alarm without ever knowing it. On this
  alarm, the light starts glowing and gets brighter and brighter
  over a period of time you select. I have mine set for 15 minutes,
  and usually by the time the light has reached maximum I'm
  coherent enough to get up. If the light doesn't do it, you can
  add sounds ranging from a buzzer to screeching sea gulls--ocean,
  wind, and ringing bells falling somewhere in between. The flaws:
  As others have mentioned, the light itself makes a buzzing noise
  at low light levels. So when it first pops on in the morning, you
  also get the annoying filiment vibration of the lamp. Secondly,
  you don't set the alarm for when you want to get up. You have to
  go through some math calculations, figuring out when you WANT to
  wake up and how long it will take you to get to that point. Then
  you set the alarm for that earlier time (awake minus groggy
  equals alarm time). Third, if you use the sound in addition to
  the light, it does increase in volume as the light increases in
  intensity, but the sound starts out so loud to begin with that
  the light is really pointless. A workaround we've found for this
  is to use the external speaker provided. Plug it into the back of
  the light, run it across the room, and bury it upside down under
  some pillows. Then pick a sound like "Birds" instead of the
  lip-curling "Harbor" or "Town". From it's buried location across
  the room, the sound hits the right volume about the time the
  light maxes out. Whoever came up with the plan of making the
  sound come on with the light was just not thinking. Fourth, the
  clock lumination can change colors, rotating through the entire
  rainbow all night long in its default setting. At first that
  looks cool. Until you realize a bright yellow clock glowing in
  your face at 2 a.m. is just wrong. The darkest setting is red,
  and the only way to choose it is to hit a pause button on the
  back when it rotates around to that color. So yes, it works. And
  it wakes me up without making me use my hammer. But the design is
  just plain stupid. If the manufacturer would wander by here, read
  this and make a few design changes, they could make a light worth
  buying</Text>

  The doll only does one dance, regardless of what skirt she has on

  while she was wearing it she might ballet, but not worth the
  hassle! Since then, my Dora lover has received various other Dora

  <Text category="dvd">Running with Scissors is a slice of life movie
  which spends time leering into the lives of eccentrics and then
  ends with no revelations or culminating event. Unfortunately what
  comes before the movie fails to culminate is not very profound or
  insightful. It is marginally entertaining and somewhat troubling.
  The lead character in the movie is a 15-year old. His parents
  divorce, and his selfish mother sends him to live with her
  charlatan psychoanalyst and his similarly-acquired family. Lead
  is on course to become a writer (who eventually writes the
  non-fiction account upon which this movie is based), but we see
  little of his efforts to develop himself as a writer. All the
  performances were serviceable, save for Gwyneth Paltrow, who
  lazily regurgitates a role she played previously. Annette Benning
  is also essentially revisiting a role she played in a better
  movie. Mrs. Benning performed excellently and selflessly, but the
  similarity of the roles intruded on my view of the movie. It is a
  sure sign that Hollywood is producing too many dysfunctional
  family flicks when all actors have been consigned to act in them
  and some actors are serving a second term. Also growing tiresome
  is the treatment of gays in movies. The presence of one or more
  characters has become a requirement in films that explore a set
  of quirky characters. Furthermore, the gays are stereotypically
  endowed with greater passion and depth of emotion, and are
  put-upon or stifled by the stodgy straights. The most promising
  characters are the psychoanalyst's wife and adopted daughter. The
  movie has some colorful and funny scenes, but these are not
  enough to justify a viewing</Text>
  <Text category="music">This one is for you. But honestly now, the guy

  Heart in Newyork, (what a) wonderful world, but generally this a
  very casual compilation, good for a couple listens. in general,
  Art Garfunkel isn't really good for more than that. Check out him

  boring. I might have a bit more respect if he wrote the
  songs--but even though there are good songwriters writing for

  <Text category="book">I didn't like the only other Dean Koontz book
  I've ever read, Watchers, but I enjoy reading Kevin Anderson's
  stuff so I thought I'd give Koontz another try because I'm a
  reasonable person and I understand that not everyone can like
  everything by an author. On to the review: I realize that this
  book was initially meant to be a screenplay but I think the
  authors would have been wise to rewrite it instead of just
  tweaking it a little when the movie deal fell through. The dialog
  is mind-numbing and predictable. Every time there was a car scene
  I could guess what kind of conversation would be held. "You drive
  too fast!" "Are you my mother?" Over and over and over. The idea
  was good. A modern-day Frankenstein . . . or rather a
  Frankenstein that had never died and had made it to present day
  (yes, I know, Frankenstein was the doctor, not his monster. But
  you get what I'm saying.). But the dialog read exactly like a
  movie script would, or like a play. This book had so much
  potential but the authors' laziness in not rewriting the entire
  thing after the movie wasn't made cost it dearly</Text>
  <Text category="music">While I doubt I'll EVER get used to the edited
  (single?) version of 'Nights In White Satin' presented here, I
  have to agree that the song selection in general is excellent for
  a compilation of this seminal band. That said, The Moody Blues
  (or more likely, their record label) haven't exactly been shy
  about releasing such anthologies and hits collections on CD,
  either. While 'Gold' represents an affordable means of buying
  some of the best known and loved music from The Moody Blues, it
  also is for me one of the most trying listening experiences as
  well. If I had to guess, I'd say much of the music contained on
  'Gold' comes from different masters than the songs currently
  found on other collections, and on the band's original CD albums.
  There are definite issues with the sonic quality of these songs
  as presented on this disc. For instance, the music track of
  'Nights' is horrendously compressed in comparison to earlier CD
  versions of this song; perhaps the record label was working with
  an unremastered single release master of the song (my guess), but
  the audible discrepancies between this version and earlier
  examples (albeit, in the full album form including The Late
  Lament and the full orchestral intro) are hard for this listener
  to stomach. I can point to any of the earlier music included here
  and say pretty much the same thing. Whatever the reason, the
  original source material used for this CD could've seriously
  benefitted from earnest remastering work. While I suspect that
  would've raised the asking price of 'Gold', I also would contend
  that great music DESERVES such caring treatment. As it is, too
  much of 'Gold' as issued is indeed quite tarnished, which in the
  real world given the metal that goes by periodic symbol of Au
  would've been impossible to do. But evidently in realm of the
  corporate music world, when selling music on the cheap and
  banging out sloppily compiled CDs it's very easy to take the most

  <Text category="book">The fatalistic view of Conservativism is
  expressed by Kirk even before the first chapter concludes as he
  states, "[Edmund] Burke, could he see our century, never would
  concede that a consumption-society, so near suicide, is the end
  for which Providence has prepared man". But wait. The
  Conservative Mind was first published in 1953, the mythical
  golden age of America with Ward and June Cleaver and Normal
  Rockwell. Meanwhile, Burke, a contemporary of the 18th century is
  pining for the 14th century. What a depressing ideology to think
  that we always live in the worst of times. There are certain
  ideological threads that carry throughout the book including a
  belief in the stratification of society. Voting should be the
  privilege of a small minority rather than universal democracy
  which Kirk saw as contributing to a degradation of society. Kirk
  writes, "What men really are seeking, or ought to seek, is not
  the right to govern themselves, but the right to be governed
  well" but what he offers is a lack of true representation. The
  author pines for the days of the aristocrat and although he
  defines the elites by wealth, intellect and lineage he clearly
  includes race and gender. Is it so surprising that Kirk lauds
  some of the worst racists in American history like Nathanial
  Bedford Forrest whom he describes as `magnificent' before quoting
  his racist vitriol? In a particularly galling move he referrers
  to pro-slavery advocate John C. Calhoun as a `defender of
  minorities' and praises John Randolph for, among other things,
  opposing doctrines of racial equality. Kirk goes on about
  Calhoun's support for states rights but his support only extended
  to southern states as he supported the Fugitive Slave Act which
  forced federal officials and law officials in Northern states to
  return runaway slave under penalty of $1000 fine. He supported
  laws that would make it illegal for northerners to even protest
  slavery. For Calhoun states rights were nothing more than a self
  serving attempt to keep slavery safe. Kirk shows his own racist
  stripes when he refers to northern `anti-slavery agitation' and
  supports Calhoun for choosing racial preservation over liberty,
  although Calhoun has an extremely warped view of liberty. One
  wonders if Kirk could even fathom the supreme irony in stating
  the Calhoun mounted a `strong protest against domination by class
  or region'. Another thread is his desire to see the reunification
  of church and state. The duty of the church is to keep the
  unclean masses in line. Quoting Samuel Coleridge, the author
  makes it clear that the truth or falsity of the church is
  irrelevant; it is an institution that must be preserved as the
  primary means of social control. Sounding like the inspiration
  for disgraced Chief Justice Roy Moore, Russell Kirk urges that,
  "state and church ought never to be separate entities, true
  religion is not merely an expression of national spirit; it rises
  far superior to earthly law, being, indeed, the source of all
  law". Kirk sees a difference between the faulty laws of man and
  the laws of God but never draws a distinction. I have to wonder
  if, like the modern Reconstructionist, Kirk wanted to see the
  laws of Leviticus imposed including executing homosexuals and
  blasphemers. He never explains how one might recognize a law of
  God besides using prejudice. The third thread would be Kirk's
  anti-intellectual (or perhaps pro-stupid) stance. He refers to
  human reason as `puny' and `impotent' and claims that we find the
  mind of God in prejudice and tradition. `Prejudice', he writes,
  `is of ready application in the emergency; it previously engages
  the mind in a steady course of wisdom and virtue, and does not
  leave the man hesitating in the moment of decision, skeptical,
  puzzled, and unresolved'. Actually what he is advocating is for
  the general population to turn over rational thought to the
  church and those higher up the social chain. Citizens are
  encouraged to exhibit awe and veneration for God and those in
  higher stations and authority. In order to grab the golden fleece
  of populism Conservatives have lately had to abandon overt
  stratification although veneration of wealth is certainly still
  evident. Like Calhoun the support for states rights remains a
  complete fa&amp;#x1A;ade. I found Russell Kirk's salesmanship of
  Conservativism generally repellent but recommend the book because
  it remains a fairly enlightening view of an ideology that
  continues to thrive to this day.</Text>

  alternativly spoof and embrace the rock 'n' roll ideals as these
  guys have, and their Spinal-Tap-meets-Ramones-mees-Beach-Boys
  style almost always works - almost. "Manifest Destiny" is a
  dissapointing release from the 'Tators. I mean its not a bad
  album, but the guys can do much better than this. There are a few
  good songs. "Disease" is hilarious, particulary the spoken word
  act from Handsome Dick at the begining. "Science Gone Too Far" is
  one of the band's catchiest tunes, proving they were as good as
  any of the big names from the 60s. Their closing cover of the
  Stooges' "Search &amp;amp; Destroy" is an okay interperatation of
  the classic. However, that's about it. The rest are mostly
  humorless FM-style rockers, and while the Dictators weren't
  selling out, they were certainly trying to become more accesible.

  <Text category="health">As Star Wars kits go, it's better than most.
  Ertl should have spent more time on the molds and getting the
  details right. The kit, while having very few parts, is not a
  novice kit. It has fit issues and badly
  &amp;amp;#65279;mis-aligned parts. The upper and lower fuselages
  do not mate well and the solar panels do not align well with the
  hull. The solar panels tend to cant to the rear, not setting in
  line with the fuse. It's a case of both of the parts, the solar
  panels and the fuselage being out of alinement. Much work is
  needed to get the solar panels to aline with the hull and the
  mounting pylons. One bright spot is the well defined, engraved
  panel lines and the small details. The upper hatch and cockpit
  glass is the clearest of the Star Wars kits I have built. It's
  better than the X-Wing and other fighters and is as good in the
  detail department as the AT-AT. Having not built the rare Tie
  Fighter kit, I cannot say how it rate against it. Once the fit
  problems are dealt with, and a good paint job is applied, it
  makes a good display, but it requires some modeling experience to
  get it to look as it should. The stand is not sturdy enough for
  the weight of the model. I suggest a clear plastic rod and a

  <Text category="dvd">I could barely get through
  the...um...er...reimagination...of the childern's classic - while
  the set design and special FX are state of the art, as usual for
  a Tim Burton film, the actual movie is hard to watch. Why? Depp's
  "performance" is chock full of ticks and mannerisms, off-putting,
  flat, self-absorbed, and finally, one-note. Rather than the
  quirky fun of the original 1972 Gene Wilder version, Burton's
  film is more horror than fantasy, often casually cruel and
  sadistic to the point of being far from family fare. While
  deliberate on Burton's part, that doesn't make the final product
  any more watchable. It's one grim, dismal, downward spiral slog.
  Not much holidday fun, huh? As with most of Burton's other big,
  expensive failures, he knows how to CREATE a convincing world,
  but has no clue how to POPULATE it with characters and situations
  we identify with and/or could care less about. The final result
  is a film that's like a fragile, hermetically sealed curio on the
  shelf - nice to look at from afar, but hard to get attached to,
  much less involved with. What a waste of millions of studio

  <Text category="dvd">For those not aware, Pumpkinhead 2 is
  (supposedly) the 1994 sequel to 1988's timeless monster classic,
  Pumpkinhead. The original was darkly creepy, superbly constructed
  in it's story, and featured a wonderfully original costume for
  the creature. Pumpkinhead 2 fails at being slightly horrorific,
  butchers the story, and basically uses the name and a simliar
  creature-suit to create an otherwise completely irrelevant
  "sequel". It's like a group of writers saw a picture of
  Pumpkinhead on the internet, read his name (and that's ALL they
  read), and decided to make their own movie. As for the plot (if
  anyone cares), a deformed boy dies and comes back as a monster to
  exact revenge on the people who hurt his feelings. I'll admit, if
  they had altered the look of the creature a bit and had chosen a
  different name for the movie, this would've been worth two or
  three stars as a "so bad it's good" B flick. But the fact that
  they totally butchered the original by attempting to connect this
  garbage to it really kills it. If you haven't seen 1988's
  Pumpkinhead, rent it or buy it -- it's a horror masterpiece
  (especially compared to this) with so much going for it. But
  avoid this sequel at all costs. I hate to put down any product,
  but I feel that this one deserves it</Text>
  <Text category="music">Okay, I used to think that Nelly was a fun guy
  to listen to. He made songs that I used to enjoy, such as St.
  Louis, E.I., Country Grammar, and Ride Wit Me off of the CD
  "Country Grammar". Then there were a good amount of other good
  songs on "Nellyville". And the good thing about these CDs was
  that there were not too many skip tracks. But with Nellyville,
  Nelly brought us the obnoxious Hot In Herre, a single that got
  plenty of radio playtime, but I could not stand. This was not a
  good sign for the future. Then comes these two new CDs, Sweat and
  Suit. I have not listened to most of Suit, but I have listened to
  most of this, and it is pure garbage. This is the same Nelly who
  made Hot In Herre for sure. It has a bunch of catchy songs that
  live off the beats and the hook to drive them to get radio
  playtime. Most of the tracks are much worse than Hot In Herre, if
  that is believable. I just want a decent CD from Nelly, I am not
  expecting a classic. Instead he drops the definition of
  materialistic garbage, and I shake my head in disgust. Avoid this
  one and get one of his older CDs, or a CD from a better

  <Text category="music">I love Patti, and her last cd was one of her

  consistantly awesome over the years from what I can see on tv. I
  really wanted to like this, but "ain't no way" this song should
  have been remade by Patti and Mary who has a pitch issue. If you
  cannot do a song justice, don't sing it!!!!! Patti still has more
  vocal range left than most of her peers, but singing high notes
  don't "make" a song, interpretation is what makes the listener
  feel the lyrics. Patti and Mary need to learn that as age will
  creep up and lower ones vocal register. Patti should have

  <Text category="music">Almost 10 years later... and I am still

  named album of all time... as the easiest summation is: it lacks
  ANY punch and keeps you waiting for something that never comes!
  Its terrible, especially when contrasted with Pornograffitti.
  Gone are the great guitar tone, riffing, rhythm, power, and
  groove that marked most of the prior three albums. It's what the
  forth side to "III Sides To Every Story" could have been...
  "Yours, Mine, The Truth, and THE SUCK". The songs are lackluster,
  but its really the guitar sound that kills this album album. "No
  Respect", surprisingly, by name, is the only song worth any
  respect and the only song near upbeat on the album. "Waiting for
  the Punchline" still remains in my top 5 worst albums of all
  time... I dont write negative reviews unless a CD is really bad
  in general or really bad compared to the bands other work. In
  this case, it fits both... its bad for Extreme... and stands up
  as exceptionally bad among all other bands' albums as well.
  Conversely, in my opinion, III Sides and Pornograffitti are 4 and
  5 star albums, respectively</Text>

  This ugle 1983 production looks like it was from the 1950's and
  Gianni S. is downright embarrassing. The costuming there makes

  but the singing is good. Angelica is okay but it is not a part
  for Plowright and I definitely did not like Dunja Vejzovic as the
  Princess. It is great to have this opera on DVD but otherwise it
  was a big disappointment. No goosebumps here. I just finished
  watching my old tape from 1981 of the Met broadcast with Scotto
  in all three of the 1 acters. What a delight -- some weak points
  here and there but it has passion in spades and that's what these
  need. Scotto was incredible in Suor Angelica. We should be so
  lucky to have these performances released on DVD but that is
  highly unlikely. I've given this La Scala DVD 2 stars but that is
  probably being generous</Text>
  <Text category="music">My DJ side: I actually had to stop the music,
  open the tray on the CD player then check whether I had the right
  CD1 down-tempo in, or some other CD that my wife played before as
  the music was so not what I was expecting, sounding more like
  Deep Forest than JVM. To my surprise, it was Jimmy's Balance 10.
  I decided to Keep an open mind and listen to it anyway. I went to
  sleep after the 4th track. The next day I decided to listen to
  the second CD (mid tempo). Again I stopped the music, opened the
  tray on the CD player then checked whether I had the (mid tempo
  CD) in instead of the down-tempo I was playing the night before.
  Sure enough, the (mid tempo) was what I had in the player, but
  did not sound much different than the lullabies I was listening
  to on CD1. When the mid-tempo was over, I thought to myself
  "well, this would be very nice for an upcoming relaxing dinner
  with friends". The next day I had high hopes for the up tempo CD,
  cause well, as the name implies, it should be where the beats and
  treats are. But No. Not really. The only reason I didn't freak
  out from listening to the 1st and 2nd CD of Jimmy Van M's Balance
  release is because for three days I kept telling myself that
  there is an up tempo CD. I didn't mind CD1&amp;amp;2 out of place
  pop tracks, I didn't mind the different types of music being
  played in sequence, or rather, out of sequence. I didn't mind
  hotel lobby music that reminded me of a hotel I stayed in two
  years ago in Vienna. All this will be forgivable when I hear the
  up-tempo, because I was so sure it's going to be awesome.
  Unfortunately, I was not quite right about my assumptions. Things
  did not start happening until track 5 (The Reducer 2), I don't
  really need some 4 tracks on the third CD to get me warmed up.
  Jimmy warmed me up for 37 tracks before that, in his down +
  mid-tempo crap. For the most part, this production of the Balance
  series - especially the first 41 tracks in sequence - churned out
  some of the most lethargic, way too slow and boring music that
  could be described, at best, as lullabies for grown ups. As for
  the last 9 tracks of the up-tempo, it is actually - dare I say -
  decent enough, but way too late, and even worse, ended
  prematurely. It should have been re-arranged with tracks in
  reverse order on every CD to be as follows: (CD3) up-tempo should
  have been (CD1) renamed (in the car from club to home), (CD2)
  mid-tempo should have been renamed (at home in the living room)
  and finally (CD1) down-tempo should have been (CD3) renamed (in
  your bedroom). This just makes more sense. The reason I say this
  is due to the disproportionate figures of dance tracks given to
  us (9) to the rest of the sleepy, mellow ones (41). For example,
  chill out house almost always start with a faster track or two
  then goes on to be slower gradually. I have never come across a
  chill CD that opened with 10 fast tracks and ended with 03 slow
  ones, that's not chill. JVM Balance did exactly that; took
  forever to ascend to a certain point, then crashed almost
  immediately. What gives? Half star for CD1 Half star for CD2 3
  stars for CD3 My human side: Dance music is not the only type of
  beautiful music out there, Duh! Jimmy made that very clear in
  this release. If you want to listen to a wide range of (not bad!)
  music, then Balance 10 is for you. Dive in JVM selection of what
  he thinks makes us human; expressions of the soul that goes
  beyond our daily necessities to survive. As a matter of fact, we
  don't even need music (or any type of arts for that matter) to
  survive at all. Still we listen to it, we crave it and for many
  people their livelihood depends on it. Music can represent our
  feelings, desires and wishes, and with JVM Deep Forest like music
  here (as I mentioned before) I can't help but wonder if he is
  going through a certain period in his life where spirituality and
  oneness with the world is a priority. I think it shows.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Compared to Argento, I must say that Mario
  Bava is for me entirely overrated. He might be a pioneer, but as
  a stylist he is sadly lacking. His seventies work is more often
  than not tiresome and tawdry, even if you like horror films.
  Argento fans seeking out 'Shock' on the strength of Daria
  Nicolodi's starring role, music by two members of Goblin (under
  the nom-de-plume 'A.Libra)and Srgento's supposed giallio-based
  debt to Bava should buy 'Shock' with caution. Although it is an
  authentic slice of Eurohorror and better than the contemporary
  garbage horror Hollywood churns out, it is still a fairly dreary,
  dull, repetitive flick with few high points and many annoyances.
  Finally, the sound and picture quality are fairly poor even when
  compared to some of Jess Franco's rubbish (and that's saying
  something) - my DVD of the silly 'She Killed In Ecstasy', filmed
  years before this looks and sounds far far better. Shame Daria
  never made films without Argento that are better than
  this..</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">The only reason I'm reviewing this movie now
  is because I just watched it on TV today. And the only reason I
  watched it was because nothing else was on. So... No, let's be
  fair. I did enjoy Analyze This, I really did, though it wasn't a
  masterpiece that would remain with me for the rest of my life, or
  even for the rest of the day. And I do love both Billy Crystal
  and Robert De Niro; they made a fantastic comedic duo in the
  first movie. I didn't have very high expectations, though,
  because I rarely expect too much of sequels. Once again, I was
  proven right. Analyze That illustrates perfectly why `sequel'
  sounds like such a dirty word. The original film had a spark of
  originality; the sequel merely takes the same idea and the same
  jokes and tries to make them funny again. But of course, that
  could never work. It's the same problem with almost every comedic
  sequel: those who haven't seen the original wouldn't understand
  the jokes, and those who have already heard them before. And that
  is why they fail time after time. So what does this movie have? A
  great comedic duo, a couple of really funny guys. Yeah, and?
  Fathers' Day had an even better pair, look what happened to that.
  A couple of good mafia jokes? Sure, sure. I even cracked a smile
  on several occasions. But that isn't enough. There are thousands
  of comedy films out there; not many of them have that special
  something that makes them memorable, and producers think they'll
  improve their odds by recycling the ones that work instead of
  trying to get new ideas. Newsflash: think again. Nobody watches
  these movies. There's no reason to when you can just watch the
  original again</Text>

  bleach with my own trays that I had made by my dentist, so it
  didn't leak out or touch my gums. My teeth weren't sensitive
  while I was using it or even right afterwards, but later in the
  day. If you have sensitive teeth, I do not recommend this product

  <Text category="toys_games">Bad enough that the toy is a scam that
  requires extra parts. But the surprise here is the complicity of
  Amazon in this misleading packaging. This is probably why the
  product is unavailable suddenly and the battery charger nowhere
  to be found. They know they made a mistake. If only they would
  contact us each now for a full refund. I wish a rep from Amazon
  could have spent the holiday week with my family as we searched
  from store to store for that charger. I wish he could have spent
  an afternoon of watching my child stare at the toy he waited for.

  <Text category="music">Some reviews have suggested that this is not
  the ideal first purchase for the un-inititiated. I am writing to
  confirm that assertion. I have read enough raving reviews about
  their subsequent releases to know that it really does get better
  from here, but what a disappointment this album was for me. It
  sounds like what you would hear coming from the garage next door.
  My advice to the kids would be to keep practing and please turn
  it down. Jack's appreciation of the blues is admirable, but only
  realised on the song "I Fought Piranhas". Tellingly, this is the
  final song on the album. Otherwise the songs are forgettable and

  <Text category="music">Like the Backstreet Boys (essentially the same

  completely commercial bands out there for ages, but at least
  groups like The Eagles wrote their own material and played their
  own instruments. Not NSYNC, who instead rely on unimaginably
  boring backing tracks and a stable of professional songwriters
  who couldn't write a decent tune to save their lives - I bet even
  their voices were digitally altered. And then there were the
  inescapable hits - Bye Bye Bye, Pop, It's Gonna Be Me, Tearin' Up
  My Heart, et al., that weren't even good the FIRST time around,
  to say nothing of the nine trillionth. No risks taken. No
  attempts to step out of their winning formula that somehow made
  this group of no-talents famous. Basically, this band was thrown
  together by a bunch of record company chumps who saw five or six
  guys who wanted to be famous (and probably had never previously
  met), sent them through the assembly line, removed any sense of
  individuallity or creativity they might've had, and dumped them
  upon the masses, who they must've brainwashed or something. I
  didn't even like this group when I was 10, to say nothing of now.
  Makes you wish Zappa was still alive - he'd have a field day with

  more and more older movies are being re-released enhanced for
  widescreen TVs that no one seems concerned that arguably the most
  classic of classical movie musicals remain in a truncated format
  that cannot be properly watched if one has a widescreen TV. These
  movies scream out for the widescreen, they were made with the
  ultimate technology of the time to be seen as wide and as broard
  as possible. Yet they remain stuck in a non anamorphic style that
  limits their enjoyment to anyone with a widescreen TV and, with
  one exception, all the people who have written about them dont
  seem to care. "Oklahoma", "Carousel", "South Pacific" and "King
  and I" need to be updated to 16.9 anamorphic widescreen (also
  preferably with some genuine extras and commentaries as well).
  Fox are years behind the rest of the movie studios in this regard
  and have only recently started to adapt their films for the
  format of the future (ie observe the two versions of "An Affair
  to Remember") of course, this is a major rip off, so anyone with
  a widescreen TV who has not bought these films --HOLD OFF, coz
  sooner or later they will get a proper release...How long? That

  <Text category="book">This book really wasn't at all what I was
  expecting, or what the title would lead one to believe. The
  subtitle, "In Search of Grace O'Malley and Other Legendary Women
  of the Sea," makes it sound as if this will be a biographical
  account of the life of Grace O'Malley, with supplemental
  information on other historical female seafarers. Not so. The
  first two chapters are devoted to the famous pirate queen
  herself, and Sjoholm only provides the skimpiest bits of
  information. I knew almost nothing about Grace O'Malley going
  into the book, and I know little more than that now. The other
  women included are discussed in even sparer detail, and most of
  them aren't even real historical figures, but legendary story
  characters and mythological creatures like mermaids. She even
  talks about Pippi Longstocking! Not what I was expecting at
  all... "The Pirate Queen" is actually devoted far more to
  Sjoholm's travels in search of information on female women of the
  sea than it is to the information itself. I learned more about
  Sjoholm and her own life than about the women she supposedly set
  out to study. She describes the inns she stayed at, the weather,
  the tourists she met, her own childhood, the abundance of
  "personal bath mats" in northern European hotels... almost
  everything but Grace O'Malley and her cohorts. In fact, the
  primary underlying theme in the book seems to be how the author
  came to the decision to change her last name from Wilson to
  Sjoholm; a story which, to be quite honest, I really couldn't
  care less about. I bought the book hoping to learn about
  interesting historical figures. It turned out to be a travel
  memoir, and a comparatively uninteresting one at that. This is a
  shame, really. Sjoholm includes just enough information on the
  various historical women she mentions - Grace O'Malley herself,
  Bessie Millie, Janet Forsyth, Christian Robertson, Eliza Fraser,
  Isobel Gunn, Betty Mouat, Freydis Eiriksdottir, Skipper Thuridur,
  Trouser-Beret, Alfhild, the "herring lassies," and numerous
  mythological characters - to whet my appetite, but then fails to
  deliver a full, satisfying portrait of any of them. She raises
  more questions than she answers, and I'd need to buy numerous
  additional books to find all the missing information. You may
  also notice, given the names, that nearly all the women mentioned
  are northern European in origin. Sjoholm entirely omits women
  seafarers active in other parts of the world, such as the famous
  pirates Anne Bonney and Mary Read who, though from Europe, sailed
  the Caribbean. As for Sjoholm's writing style, the book is an
  easy read, but not a very enjoyable one. Sjoholm's writing is
  given to an abundance of nearly nauseating metaphors. For
  example: "The lava fields looked like vanilla cake batter poured
  over thick jumbles of dates, walnuts, and chocolate chips. In the
  sun the moss could also look like lemon yogurt spooned generously
  over granola" (pg. 222). Flowery, gratuitous, and often
  ridiculous images like this are to be found in almost every
  paragraph... peppered throughout the book like poppyseeds in a
  muffin, you might say... It's not the worst book I've ever read,
  but I do wish I'd spent my money on something else. It doesn't
  deliver what it promises, and there are plenty of more
  interesting and informative books out there to pick up
  instead</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Like many my age, I grew up with Legos. My
  wife bought this kit for me for Christmas. I was excited. After a
  couple of days of work, my excitement had turned to frustration
  and finally to anger. This kit is poorly designed, and the
  instructions are not well thought out. First, the "Death Star" is
  built on a base that you construct of Legos. This base is not
  very sturdy. The instructions said to put a bunch of parts just
  on one side. Left alone, the structure would tip over because of
  the imbalance. Much of the structure had such flimsy connections
  that the slightest thing would break connections. I don't mean
  the quality of the Legos; those things are impossible to break. I
  mean the way in which various bars, hinges, etc were put
  together. In the end my wife and I probably spent 40 hours
  building something that would not hold together. I love Legos but
  this kit gets nothing but ill will for me. For lack of a better

  hamfisted camera angle switches, bizarre washed-out colors, some

  hasn't the faintest idea how to shoot a concert let alone one
  featuring musicians of this caliber. hey prince, just so you

  you can match what you'd been able to do had you still had the

  <Text category="dvd">I remember going to great lengths to fit a
  matin&amp;#x1A;e showing of HEAVEN'S PRISONERS into a busy
  Saturday afternoon during its 1996 theatrical release.
  Considering the source material and the talent behind and in
  front of the camera, our little filmgoing party of detective-film
  fans and Alec Baldwin groupies (a.k.a. my mom, my stepfather, and
  me) found this contemporary film noir to be a big disappointment.
  Baldwin, who also served as co-producer, brought James Lee
  Burke's New Orleans ex-cop/recovering alcoholic hero Dave
  Robichoux from the printed page to the big screen. While Baldwin
  and the rest of the cast did well in fleshing out Burke's
  characters and have some tangy tough-guy/gal dialogue, they're
  hampered by two things: 1.) The film's slo-o-o-ow pacing. Maybe
  the Louisiana heat got to everyone, not just Baldwin. Of all the
  actors, Long Island native Baldwin sweats the most, so much that
  it began to remind me of the sweating-bullets gags with Albert
  Brooks in BROADCAST NEWS and Robert Hays in AIRPLANE! 2.) A plot
  that, as rendered in the film (whether it's the fault of the
  screenwriter or the editor, I can't be sure), never quite follows
  through on any of its elements. It's too bad, because these
  elements could've made for an exciting movie: drug dealing,
  illegal alien smuggling, rival crime bosses (one is played
  colorfully by Eric Roberts before he became a parody of himself,
  essentially playing a Southern-fried version of his character
  from director Phil Joanou's 1992 thriller FINAL ANALYSIS), an
  adorable little Salvadoran orphan girl (named "Alafair" by the
  Robichouxs, after Dave's mom. Late in my pregnancy at the time, I
  liked the name Alafair so much, I nearly changed my mind about
  naming my then-unborn daughter Siobhan!), and a bevy of
  beautiful, beguiling women, including earth mother Kelly Lynch,
  vampy Teri Hatcher in a full-frontal nude scene that was much
  ballyhooed at the time, and Mary Stuart Masterson, looking like a
  young Jessica Lange in what was then a change-of-pace role for
  her: a troubled stripper who loves Robichoux. Despite the sexy
  promises in the movie's ads, none of the ladies share anything
  with Baldwin but dialogue and some kisses and/or embraces. Maybe
  the climate was already so hot, the filmmakers didn't want to add
  any further steaminess for fear of poor Baldwin collapsing from
  heat prostration! As my mom put it at the time: "I thought the
  height of my day would be seeing sexy, dashing Alec Baldwin, but
  he came up sweaty, rumpled, tired, depressed, and moving as if he
  was in slow motion. If he'd made love as many times as he got
  beaten up, it would've been the sexiest picture of '96!" To be
  fair, there *are* a number of strong characterization and action
  scenes, but there's just too darn much talky, molasses-paced lag
  time between them -- and yet, oddly, some of the scenes end
  abruptly just as they're about to become intriguing! Perhaps
  Joanou, Baldwin &amp;amp; Co. could've dredged a tighter, more
  involving thriller out of this if they'd whittled the 140-minute
  running time down to 105 minutes or so. As HEAVEN'S PRISONERS is
  now...well, read James Lee Burke's books instead.</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">Paycheck is a disappointing and sometimes
  frustrating film because it clumsily toys with a number of
  potentially brilliant ideas without really knowing what to do
  with them. These key concepts come courtesy of Philip K. Dick,
  via his original short story, though the film poorly represents
  the themes and conceits that have made his stories into
  unforgettable classics. As a thriller, Paycheck depends upon our
  identification with its imperiled hero, but the movie is never
  able to make us truly care about Ben Affleck's Michael Jennings
  or his fragile state of mind, and that's something Dick would
  have found unforgivable. Only Uma Thurman really earns her
  paycheck here. The premise is high concept, and the prophetic
  threat is revealed to be of apocalyptic proportion, but Paycheck
  is never more than a pedestrian action film spun from chains of
  meaningless chase sequences and flat fight scenes. The future
  world created by John Woo isn't nearly as engaging or convincing
  as, say, the captivating science fiction setting crafted by
  Stephen Spielberg for another high-profile Dick adaptation,
  Minority Report. For Paycheck, the comparison is not flattering.
  Sadly, Woo can't even keep himself from forcing his own creative
  preoccupations into the film, and a resulting motorcycle chase
  sequence is outright uninspired and may represent the film's low.
  Some scenes are enjoyable, and there are fleeting flashes of wit
  and excitement, but much of what unfolds seems inappropriately
  conceived or placed. Paycheck isn't a smart film and, what's
  more, it sometimes assumes that its audience isn't even paying
  attention. As a result, the film never comes close to living up
  to its potential. The material and the audience deserve better.
  Unfortunately, Paycheck is forgettable fare and, truly, it is
  without any real payoff. --Brian A. Dixon Revelation

  speaking of women...Ludacris never met one who wasn't a h-o.
  Ludacris is the epitome of the sexual hypocrisy that plagues men:
  you demean and look down on women for being h-oes, yet you hope
  every woman is a h-o so you'll have no problems getting laid. But
  then, you're so disgusted with the fact the woman behaves too
  much like you, so you go and find a "nice girl" because you can
  respect her and marry her and procreate with her. But then you
  cheat on her with a "bad girl" because h-oes need h-oes; but then
  you can't respect the "bad girl" because she's a slut, so you go
  back to the "good girl." But she's not nasty enough for you, so
  then...around and around we go. Women are basically being
  punished for men not being able to make up their minds about what
  the heck they want from us. He's OBSESSED with sex and h-oes. It
  makes you wonder if he has hang-ups about it. Maybe Ludapis saw
  his mother selling herself in a backalley for a dollar and it
  scarred his outlook on women forever. I guess if she had actually
  RAISED him and shown him how to respect women-- ALL women--then
  he probably could have grown up to be a respectable guy instead
  of the prurient dummy he is. What's the music like? Well I'll
  give him 2 stars for mentioning TLC in What's Your Fantasy.
  That's it. Addendum: 7/27-07 Some may wonder why I'm "wasting' my
  time giving Ludacris negative reviews. Well, first of all, if
  only people who liked the product were the only ones to review
  it, everything on Amazon would have 5 stars, which would be an
  inaccurate sign of its quality. Secondly, I don't like Ludacris.
  I would give Ludacris more respect if I felt he gave my gender
  more respect; but he doesn't. My diatribe above shows what my
  problem with him is, and I feel that argument is valid. There's
  no way to critique Ludacris' music without critiquing his
  hypocrisy regarding women. Why should I like him when he seems to
  have nothing but contempt for us? I'm biased against him because
  he's biased against me. So he gets a bad rating out of
  s-p-i-t-e</Text>

  <Text category="music">The lady can sing, but her "Christian" message
  is compromised because of her part in "Chasing Papi", where she
  played a woman who - had she had the chance - would have hopped
  into bed with her on-screen boyfriend prior to marriage. It's
  "Crystal Clear" to me that Jaci broke my heart in a million
  pieces when she played that part. It's really tragic to see such
  a beautiful young lady with such a opowerful voice and message
  now reduced to nothing more than a hypocritical wannabee, much in
  the same way that Stacie Orrico is now becoming.....and is it
  just me, or is it coincidence that these two womens' album covers
  look strikingly similar? It appears their paths in life are
  similar, too: compromising a message and a stand that once set
  them worlds apart. As with a recent review of Orrico that I made,
  I'll give Jaci Velasquez her due: she can sing, and what I mean
  by that is sing the roof off of a house! This album was
  excellent.....was. Now, whenever I think or hear of Jaci
  Velasquez, I can only think one word: HYPOCRITE</Text>

  him. Like most DBZ movies, it doesn't fit into the timeline. If
  we worked it in, then Goten and Trunks would only be a matter of
  hours away from using the Fusion technique. Had this movie taken

  <Text category="dvd">There are some good things about this film --
  it gives audiences an idea of how insidious the Nazi propaganda
  machine was, for one thing. It also shows the main character,
  Antoine Moreau, a (fictional) famous French mime, having his eyes
  opened to the reality of the Nazis' 'final solution' to the
  'Jewish problem'. Brought to a Czech town that has been 'given to
  the Jews' by the Nazis in order to stage a performance that will
  be seen by the Swiss Red Cross delegation, hopefully persuading
  them that the Germans are not as monstrous as they have been
  portrayed, Moreau changes his original idea for the performance,
  hoping to get a 'silent' message to the Red Cross that will let
  them know the true fate of Jews (and other 'undesirables') at the
  hands of the Nazis. I'll briefly mention a couple of
  less-than-positive observations, and then get into my main
  problem with the film. The production values reminded me a bit of
  a made-for-TV movie -- and from time to time it seemed that the
  sound was a little out of sync with the picture. The image
  quality on the DVD could have been much better as well. Also, the
  Shanachie DVD release is version of the film that has been dubbed
  with English. This is, in the case of this film, not very
  well-done. The cabaret singer, for instance, comes across as
  completely unbelievable in that her voice doesn't match her face
  or ethnicity in the least. Everyone in the film winds up with an
  English accent, which detracts from any authenticity that might
  have been retained using subtitles instead of clumsy dubbing.
  Another reviewer below brought up the dubbing problem as it
  apples to one of one of the children, Stella (portrayed by Linda
  Jablonska). Her voice does not sound at all like that of a little
  girl. She develops a bit of a crush on Antoine, which in itself
  seems like a pretty natural occurrence under the circumstances --
  here is a famous artist who has come to the village to stage a
  show, with her as one of the leads, who is kind and supportive
  and friendly to her, who listens to her ideas and feelings with
  attention and respect. The problem I had was with one scene in
  particular. Stella has been caught on the streets after curfew
  and chased by police. She bites one of them and manages to elude
  them by squeezing through a break in a fence. In the process of
  getting away, she gets muddy, scrapes herself bloody in a few
  places, and tears her clothing. She goes to Moreau's hotel and
  climbs to the ledge outside his room and taps on the window. When
  he opens it, he is shocked at her condition, lets her into the
  room, and begins to try to clean her cuts and scrapes, asking
  what had happened. He then draws a bath for her, so she can wash
  herself. As Moreau sits down, still in a bit of a daze over what
  has happened to her, she steps into the bath. Just before she
  pulls her dress over her head, she says to him, `No looking.' He
  shakes his head to bring himself out of his daze and says `Of
  course', then repairs to the adjoining bedroom, where he lies
  down on the bed to have a smoke, allowing her to conduct her bath
  in privacy. A moment later, he hears a noise and looks up to see
  Stella emerge from the bathroom, completely naked, in a
  full-frontal nude shot. Moreau gets up from the bed and lifts the
  covers, suggesting that she warm herself. She climbs into the
  bed; he covers her up, and steps away to the other side of the
  room. There is nothing about the scene that implies that anything
  improper occurred. He has simply offered her care and comfort and
  sympathy. This shot only lasts a few seconds, but I feel that,
  regardless of the director's reasoning for shooting it in the
  first place, it could have been left out. If the point was to
  show that Moreau has either had morals all along, or that he has
  acquired them, it could have been demonstrated in a variety of
  other ways. Earlier in the film, Stella had witnessed one of her
  caregivers, semi-nude, in Moreau's hotel room (Stella saw this
  from outside). Given her `schoolgirl crush' on Moreau, it seemed
  natural for her to become upset over this. As a result, however,
  the scene after the bath comes across as a young girl
  inappropriately mimicking adult sexual behaviour. This, combined
  with the `adult' voice dubbed over Stella's, makes the scene even
  more disquieting. There are some viewers who might argue that, in
  Europe, `standards' involving nudity and sexuality are not as
  reactionary as those in the US. In many instances, I would
  wholeheartedly agree with them. There is much hypocrisy in the
  dynamics of American culture and moral values, and not a little
  bit of neurosis. However, the sexual objectification of children
  is something about which I feel very strongly...and I think the
  scene in question in this film amounts to exactly that. Don't get
  me wrong -- I'm not so prudish that I turn away from even
  full-frontal nudity in a film, if it's not gratuitous and it's an
  integral part of the storyline...but here, it involves a
  prepubescent girl, and could have easily been left out. It
  worries me bit that this point has not been made by other
  reviewers. Have we become so numbed in respect to nudity in films
  that many can't recognize an instance where it's not only
  unnecessary, but potentially harmful? I'm glad I've seen the film
  -- and I'd recommend it with a bit of praise and some strong
  reservations, as noted above. With all of the ridiculous claims
  from some quarters that the Holocaust never happened, I think
  it's vitally important for films on the subject to be made and
  seen. The Czech film ALL MY LOVED ONES is an excellent film about
  this horrible time that has not gotten the attention it deserves
  -- seek it out. n.b. -- This is the second time I have posted
  this exact review. I noticed today (6 April 2006) that it has,
  for some reason, been removed from the site. I've re-read what
  I've written, and I don't see anything objectionable or
  offensive. The issues I have with the film are discussed
  straightforwardly. If anyone objects to anything I've written
  here, I'd like to know what it is.</Text>

  <Text category="music">Before you all dismiss me as an obsessive,
  close-minded thrash fanatic; I thoroughly enjoyed "Chaos AD,"
  which was a Sep' album with the perfect balance of
  experimentation and death metal. I like the idea of experimenting
  with tribal sounds, but with those sounds, Max decided to throw
  in downtuned guitars, not doing guitar solos, excessive
  profanity, lame "I hate this I hate that" lyrics, and guest
  musicians. The only decent songs on here are "Roots Bloody Roots"
  and "Dictators***;" everything else is awful. This isn't
  Sepultura, this is Soulfly. I'm glad Max left because if he
  stayed in the band, Sep' would have degenerated into a nu-metal
  band. For good Sepultura albums, get these instead (starting with
  the best): Schizophrenia Morbid Visions/Bestial Devastation

  <Text category="music">It is hard to imagine what the American
  songbook ever did to Rod Stewart that he would decide to degrade
  it like this, not once, not twice, but three times. Stewart's
  decision to approach these shop-worn standards ranks up there
  with Napoleon's decision to invade Russia during the winter, it
  is staggeringly ill conceived. The problem, of course, is his
  voice. The selection of material seems ideally suited to showcase
  his limitations as a singer, which are countless. For starters,
  he has almost no range at all. Next, his raspiness has no
  inherent beauty, and these are songs intended for beautiful
  voices. By their very nature, the selections are vehicles for
  skilled singers, their simplicity allows excellent performers to
  interpret and express individual perspective. Stewart, because he
  is a rock and blues singer, never learned the fundamentals of
  singing and certainly never developed a mature, expressive voice.
  He scratches along the surface of these listless vehicles with
  the charm of a man skating over ice with sandpaper strapped to
  his shoes. Banks of strings and fabulously misguided
  collaborations, (Dolly Parton!), do not mask but highlight what
  is wrong with this project. Bear in mind that I like Rod Stewart;
  he's from Scotland and he's the prototypical Brit blues belter.
  If you want to know what he's actually good at, dig out your copy
  of Jeff Beck's first release, Truth. Stewart delivers some of the
  best blue-eyed twelve bar wailing ever recorded. But that's the
  problem. On Truth it was the cigarettes, whisky, and swagger in
  his voice that made him great - it wasn't about singing technique
  - it was about authenticity. Here, the focus is on singing, and
  his limitations are embarrassingly spotlighted. Albums like this
  never get made unless the performer already has name recognition
  that guarantees sales, nightmares of this stripe could never
  stand on their own merits. To be avoided at all cost.</Text>
  <Text category="book">From the cover and a quick glances at some of
  the colorful photo filled chapters, this book seem promising at
  first. But the cliched saying of never judge a book by its cover
  has taken its toll. This book provides marginal advice on how to
  -potentially- make a profit from the wonderful world of digital
  photography, however, it fails to give any real world working
  model on how this can be accomplished. Most of the marginally
  useful advices and sales model, i.e. pricing structure on stock
  photos, are based on the author's own personal preference and
  experience, rather than taking into account the wide breadth of
  pricing methods that exist in the real world of photography. This
  is a great book for amateurs that are trying to break into the
  business of selling their prints from an outline or a strict
  table-of-content perspective of the available methods and
  channels of distribution to target, e.g. card stock, stock photo,
  art fairs, etc. Most of topics cover seem to be more
  'theoretical' than actual real-world hands down information and
  the author seems to expend more time, energy and care in
  expressing his disdain (with a condescending overtone, might I
  add) toward enthusiastic amateurs that aim to make it big and
  quick. His favorite recurring adjectives for such amateurs
  includes, but certainly are not limited to: prima donnas,
  pretentious, and pretend aficionado. Heller may be a
  [self-aggrandizing] professional photographer, but anyone with
  such high caliber should be more helpful, than pompous or
  supercilious. Remember Heller, you were an amateur at one point
  too. Further more, Heller likes to take a seemingly interesting
  idea, get your hopes up and then tell you why you shouldn't
  pursue it because the odds are just too high against you.
  Bottomline: If you are serious about licensing your photographs
  for use, then this book does not really cover the core
  foundations that you need to get your feet wet. On the otherhand,
  if you want to take a look at what you can do to -potentially-
  make a profit from your hobby, then this book basically gives you
  an -general- idea. I'd give this book a 1-star for the lack of
  usable information and the author's cockiness, but it does
  contain some interesting theories and sales model to warrant a
  2-star rating</Text>

  <Text category="book">Save your time, money and patience. This may
  be the worst book I have read since the equally monotonous,
  predictable Stone Barrington novel "The Short Forever". Wow, this
  one stinks. Like others, I put up with the shallow characters,
  ludicrous dialogue and endless parade of showers, boobs and guns
  to figure out whodunit. Unfortunately, this book had an ambiguous
  ending that seeks to be clever but is instead is just stupid. Who
  on earth did kill Vance? And come to think of it, who gives a
  damn? I don't what women did to Stuart Woods but he sure seems to
  hold them in complete contempt. Every female character, save for
  Isabel the maid, felt compelled to practically rape our handsome
  hero. Each is flawless and gorgeous but also all are dumb,
  vacuous, self-centered and thoroughly unlikeable - hey a couple
  are even truly psychotic! The only normal female character who
  spared Stone, Mary Ann, unfortunately has a room temperature IQ.
  I am hardly a prude, but I lost count of how many women either
  Vance or Stone made love to in the course of one short novel and
  felt the need to take a long hot shower to rid myself of the
  feelings of filth. Mr. Woods either lives in a world of complete
  ignorance or the reading public is a lot less discriminating than

  <Text category="music">I think India is one of the most talented
  artists today. Her voice is sensational. Sadly, as with many
  great artists today, this album feels more producer/market-driven
  rather than artist-driven. I understand that Regaetton is popular
  right now. I would even understand including a few
  Reggaeton-flavored songs to "keep up with the times" (Shakira's
  "La Tortura" comes to mind). But who mixes two genres within a
  single song?!? "Soy Differente" flows perfectly as a salsa, until
  Regaetton beats come in. The style feels very out-of-place in
  this song, as in most other songs in this album. Maybe this kind
  of thing will work at a club, but not for extended listening. In
  my opinion, the producers are making this album more marketable
  while stiffling India's own style. I hope she will regain contol

  <Text category="music">In the past, I used to distance myself from
  certain rock genres because of a bad first experience. I'd be
  introduced to band, not like it, and claim the entire genre as
  being 'not for me'. The Forecast, however, has changed how I
  feel. I, personally, love a heartfelt emo record just as much as
  the next guy, but only because I was introduced to Jimmy Eat
  World and Spitalfield a couple of years back. Those bands allowed
  me to embrace the entire genre as a whole, and expand my emo
  knowledge. Imagine though, if you will, that I was new to emo.
  You, in theory, hand me a copy of "late night conversations" and
  tell me to listen. Of course, I hate it, and lose any interest I
  may have had in the genre. To make a long story short, the only
  good that came out of 'late night conversations' (an
  underproduced, generic, stale piece of s**t) was the revelation
  that came post-listen. Never judge an entire genre by the first
  or second band you're introduced to (from said entire genre). Not
  every metal band is Iron Maden. Not every punk-pop band is blink
  182. Not every nu-metal band is linkin park. Not every 'emo' band
  is jimmy eat world. Every aspect of music has it's ups and downs,
  and the forecast is clearly one of the downs. Now that I've bored
  you with an entire rant about nothing, I'd like you to PASS on
  'late night conversations'. With your help, the forecast won't
  sell another record, and, in turn, leave the scene forever. Not
  recommended, duh</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Sorry, but this movie BLEW! The premise was
  there, but the delivery just sucked. I can only take the
  suspension of belief so far. We are supposed to believe that this
  guy has never told his new gf (whom he's been w/for at least a
  year) about his last, one before that, and gf before that. At
  least two of them have his home phone number: they've never
  called? She's never seen the caller ID? She's never answered the
  phone? Give me a break! THen she holds fake interviews with the
  exes and just opens up the most ridiculous can of worms. She
  meets up with Joyce (the most recent) whom she finds out that she
  genuinely likes, and starts believing that the bf should really
  be with her. Joyce is none the wiser, but if you ask me, Joyce
  had stalker qualities b/c she harassed him when he was with the
  model, calls his house right back when she gets the call on her
  phone, keeps that stupid boomerang IN A FRAME, etc. This chick,
  Stacy (Brittany M) had to be incredibly stupid not to see where
  this was ultimately going. Holly Hunter's character is precisely
  why I have more male friends than female. Stacy just met this
  woman and she's revealing all these things about her personal
  life and this woman is all too happy to help her wallow in the
  craziness of this movie. I never expected the 'big climax,' but I
  did ask myself several times "will this Barb (HH) chick back the
  **** off?!" On to the climax:it was actually a surprise, but what
  blew me was that everything ended up honky dory for Stacy...after
  she humiliated all those people. I never got the impression that
  the bf (Derrick) was cheating on her, yet that tacky talk show
  would have made you think different. The ONLY reason he pissed me
  off was because he didn't read STacy the riot act in the end.
  This movie tries to wax philosophical, and you just end up hating
  all of the characters...except for the dog. A very passible
  movie. I wouldn't even bother.</Text>

  they feel the need to plasture their faces all over every one of
  their crappy unintelligent so called albums!! Nothing descent to

  even like music, they just want to be a "celebrity" and be rich

  <Text category="toys_games">We purchased this for our daughter as a
  Christmas gift. What a nightmare. First of all, the scissors it
  came with...well let's just say my teeth cut better. This scissor
  is so DULL we'd be willing to allow our three year old to handle
  it. It cuts NOTHING. This sewing machine comes with one tiny
  square of material, so you have to be sure to have material on
  hand if you want your child to actually attempt sewing something.
  It's incredibly difficult and frustrating to thread the needle.
  The stitches are way too loose and break apart at the slightest
  touch. There is no bobbin, so there's nothing to hold your stitch
  together. We wanted to make a simple little pillow for my
  daughter's dolls...wishful thinking! The minute you attempt to
  turn your project right-side-out, the stitches come apart and you
  have NOTHING. My daughter just walked away. We can't believe
  Singer would be the maker of this 1.99 piece of plastic.</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">The movie has a great story. Unlike
  Streetfighter Alpha the Movie, Alpha Generations actually follows
  the correct storyline. It had the potential to be a great movie,
  but there is to much wrong with it that cannot be overlooked that
  will irritate you immediately. The character design sucks(Why
  dosen't Ryu look like Ryu?), the English voice acting sucks(I
  recommend watching it in japanese with subtitles) and the fights
  suck. The only fight worth watching during the whole movie is Ryu
  vs. Sakura. This film dosen't even deserve a 1 star rating. I

  a whole new dimension to the movie. As far as this soundtrack

  <Text category="dvd">This could have been one of the best films of
  the 80's. All of the components are there. Ford gives the best
  acting of his career. The production is elegant and holds up as
  often breathtaking even by today's standards. Two things however
  really bring this movie down. The major negative here I believe
  is Polanski's insistence on starring Emmanuelle Seigner. This is
  one of the sexiest women I have ever seen grace a film, but it is
  the understatement of the year to say that she can't act at all.
  In fact, I think that she might have just about turned in the
  worst acting performance I have ever seen in this film and it
  totally destroys Ford's performance. When the film was over I
  thought about it and came to the conclusion that there is really
  two halves here. The first half is dynamite; the second with
  Seigner is a totally different beast, your average stupid kid
  thriller. Watch this film and dare contradict my statement here.
  Get beyond her obvious good looks and tell me she just was not
  meant for this part. It's so bad that Ford fades into the
  background in any scene that she was also in. OK, the second
  negative in this film are these two agents that keep popping up.
  There is no explanation ever given as to how they knew where Ford
  and Seigner would be time and time again. It really ruins what
  could have been a very nicely done and subtle plot. They were
  never needed and muddle an otherwise great story. I am really
  kind of mad with Polanski here. He destroyed what could have been
  one of the better films he has made. And this statement comes
  from one who worships the ground Polanski walks on.</Text>

  like it the first time, which surprised me, so I tried it again).
  It doesn't showcase her voice or her talents. The songs are very

  <Text category="dvd">King Vidor's rather contrived adaptation of
  Tolstoy's epic riddled with miscast actors, a boring script, and
  a hurried screenplay. In short, another one of those 50-year old
  films that have outlived their audience to slowly sink into
  Hollywood's vaults of oblivion. The story follows the main
  characters of Tolstoy's novel such as Natasha (Audrey Hepburn),
  Prince Andrei (Mel Ferrer), and Pierre (Henry Fonda.) The film is
  too short for the novel and the acting stinks: particularly that
  of Henry Fonda as Pierre. Henry Fonda is as stiff as fossilized
  wood in this film; his pondering stare and preaching voice
  reminds me of a bad Charleton Heston film. As far as the battle
  scenes so greatly praised by the main reviewer, they are as
  sparse as they are realistic. All of the costumes and props in
  this film are horribly fake. In short, the only thing that
  remains impressive about this film is the fact that Hollywood
  bothered to put it on DVD. Apart from that, the acting is as
  worthless as the contrived screenplay and shallow dialogue. Don't
  buy this film</Text>
  <Text category="music">As owner of Every single Chill/Lounge music CD
  I am aware of, this was the biggest dissapointment in a long
  time. Ultra Chill series 1-4 was outstanding. While Ultra Chill
  05 is not a complete disaster, I could not find one song worthy
  of a 5/5 star rating. Quite a few 4 star songs and lots of 2-3
  star songs. Some of the better songs were repeated on older Chill
  discs or present on other series of lounge discs. There is a lot
  of Jazz and Latin chill on these two discs, which I also like,
  but the Jazz/world/latin chill tracks here were repeats or
  nothing great. I think the person that rated this 5 stars doesn't
  own a lot of lounge/chill and is probably a lot easier to please.
  I'm very dissapointed. Maybe this 'genre' is all dried up! :) Oh
  well... I'm off to listen to "Chillout Seesions 8"... Hopefully
  it will be a lot better. I highly reccomend Chillout seesions by

  <Text category="book">I'm very disappointed in this book, although
  some information IN it is valuable, it will take a long time to

  but not a handy guide to flip to on a regular basis and find
  ideas for what you need. Although broken into sections, they are
  not readily found or visible. One must search the information
  needed as in a research assignment. The reproducibles are MAINLY
  for elementary grades. This was not stated in the very short and
  brief summary of it's contents, on-line. Although the price was
  reasonable, I'm not pleased with the way the book is organized
  &amp;amp;amp; printed</Text>
  <Text category="book">What this is: an epic adventure. It would be
  imappropriate to review the WOT series when speaking of the
  Prophesies of the Dragon book; it's also not really a supplement
  akin to, say, The Monster Manual for D&amp;amp;D--the only extra
  skills, feats, backgrounds, etc are those directly related to
  NPCs in the campaign. What Prophecies is designed to do is take a
  party of characters through their first six levels of
  adventuring, which correspond roughly to the first six books of
  the series of novels. The players are allowed to play a key
  behind the scenes role in the story of the novels and cameos have
  been scripted for many of the book's key characters. It's a
  really ambitious undertaking; players have to be given a
  compelling storyline, feel like they're making a difference in a
  campaign that covers over a year of game time, without letting
  them change what happens in the novels. Does it work? I am
  currently GMing this adventure. On paper, it looks really good.
  Some of the scenes, especially in the later parts of the story,
  look exciting, moving even. Faile's cameo is perfect, for
  example. In practice, though, it's been an extremely frustrating
  experience. First, the early encounters (as pointed out by
  another reviewer) are unnecessarily difficult and add nothing to
  the plot. As things progress, the authors presume too much on the
  goals and motivations of the players. There is one chapter, for
  example, where the introduction says something along the lines
  of, "Upon entering the city, the players will want to find (a
  certain NPC) as soon as posible and will definitely want to
  investigate the actions of (another NPC)." The players in my
  campaign knew they wanted to talk to one of these guys
  eventually, but the other one was off their radar completely.
  Throughout, I've had to improvise ways to keep them approximating
  the plot line of the campaign and by chapter 3, they're feeling
  very manipulated. The campaign assumes the party wants to do
  nothing more than hunt down dark friends and expose evil plots
  and will take great personal risk and go through great hardship
  (including, at one point, a monthlong trek through a winter
  wilderness without adequate provisions) on the chance of
  thwarting same. Characters with any other motivations (say, a
  character modeled after Mat or Nynaeve in the books) will feel
  forced into situations unnaturally. There has been more than one
  point where one of the players saying, "I *think* this is where
  the plot wants us to go." So, in conclusion, while this adventure
  is excellent in its dreams and scope--and it's definitely better
  than something I could have designed myself--but it will fail
  often fail as a game. If you are intending to run a WOT campaign,
  buy this adventure, read it so that you thoroughly understand its
  scope BEFORE you even let your players make up characters. The
  characters need to be created to fit the story or the story won't
  work</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">I watched the first half hour of this and

  more for spite (and those 15 minutes we all want) than anything
  else. Getting called down by Michael Moore at a public event and
  then talking to some sympathetic people outside (people who
  probably just had nothing better to do on campus that night)
  doesn't prove that Michael Moore followers are all waffling
  malcontents, dude. Overall, I rate this film FAIL</Text>

  <Text category="book">Maybe it is me but this novel was about as
  exciting as watching the grass grow. It is the first mystery
  novel that I have read by a female author and I hope that it is
  not representative of the gender. But, by the reviews here, all
  by women, I can see that Jance writes to that crowd. Her readers
  seem to like being taken down the aimless boring pass of
  relationship drible. If you want to spend 10 pages with the main
  character sitting and talking about nothing in her mothers house
  or on her friends porch talking about their health than this book
  is for you. It is amazing that Jance can start great with the
  murder scene and then 200 pages later start uncovering her first
  clue, the insulin bottle. Jance gives no indication that Oak
  Vista or the stranded stranger are even remotely related to the
  story. Do not start this book it is absolutely a total waste of
  time. If you want a good mystery read Coben, Crais, Patterson or
  Michael Connely</Text>

  <Text category="book">Anyone with intelligence can see that Ann
  Coulter is not attempting to make any meaningful or objective
  analysis of politics. She is using inflammatory marketing to stir
  up the emotions of the most die-hard, flag-waving conservatives.
  Until this attention-seeking labeling of other Americans as
  'good' or 'bad' stops, there will never be true understanding of
  the complexties of American politics or foreign policy by the
  general public. I don't agree with Bush's war and I didnt vote
  for him. But he's not a 'bad person'; he did not invade Iraq
  because he is 'evil' or 'stupid'. I can appreciate both sides of
  an argument; I can avoid generic categorizations. I would never
  watch any news, liberal or conservative, that had a clear
  political bias. Why can't Ann Coulter arrive at this same level
  of common sense? Well, she wouldnt sell as many books; she
  wouldnt be on TV. It has to be "Liberals Hate America" or "The
  Conservative Nazi Agenda". We have the duty as thinking
  Americans, in the most advanced free country in the world, in
  these modern times of massive amounts of free information, to
  STOP PAYING ATTENTION TO THIS GARBAGE. Get the facts and stop

  <Text category="book">Not to be disrespectful but are you people for
  real? I can't believe this book is getting 4 and 5 stars. There
  was nothing good about this book. A bunch of people in the book
  did not even matter, Bill Kendall's wife, the new anchor man Pete
  whatever his last name was, the boss Yelena, Eliza's boyfriend,
  the priest, even the soon-to-be-president and his wife, I mean
  what's the point in even mentioning them? They were not involved
  in the main events. She didn't even talk about what happened to
  them at the end. The judge is the only one that matters, and she
  didn't even write about him all that much. Really disappointing.
  As I said I don't mean to be disrespectful, but to give this book
  5stars, you must have read either bedtime stories all your life,
  or not have read anything. DON"T WASTE YOUR MONEY that's all i
  have to say. sorr</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Michael Moore filmed this propaganda,partially
  financed by the United Auto Workers, to distract attention from
  the real reason GM was forced to shutter plants - the Japanese
  auto invasion, made possible by GM's unhealthy cost structure.
  The company was burdened with exorbitant UAW wages, something
  union friendly Michael Moore does his best to conceal. So Roger
  Smith becomes the reason for the plant closings. Years of losses
  at GM have shown Moore's twisted arguments to be exactly what
  they were then - phoney UAW sponsored lies to shift attention
  away from the primary role played by the UAW in the death spiral
  of the automakers. Moore and others pretend GM management had
  dropped the ball, but GM lost tens of thousands of engineers and
  salaried staff, let go long before any unionized line workers
  felt any pain. ALL of GM's problems are the result of the lack of
  profits resulting from the UAW albatross - slow redesign cycles,
  lack of money for research, you name it. Moore will never mention
  how the UAW has screwed the consumers for the past 70 years and
  how now that consumers have a choice, they find the better value
  in Asian autos. Nobody wants to pay a UAW worker to bolt on a
  fender while making more than their family doctor. The UAW has
  fixed labor prices for long enough. Enough is enough and Moore is
  shown to be the stooge of the unions with this preposterous piece
  of slanted fiction he laughingly calls a "documentary."</Text>
  <Text category="health">I really like the Crane humidifiers for
  children, my youngest daughter has been using the penguin at
  night for quite some time. It occasionally glugs but the most
  part is very quiet. So I was confident that the apple shape my
  elder daughter chose would be just as good. I was surprised when
  it arrived as the water cannister was much flatter and smaller
  than I had expected and the design of the base which controled
  the water flow was different. Still we started to use it and
  quickly discovered that it didn't detect the water level
  accurately and frequently turned itself off. This may be a fault
  with the one I received and so I have sent it back, or it may be
  a design flaw with this shape. I have just received the soccer
  ball and the base on this looks more like the penguin and the
  water cannister is more like a sphere. So although I haven't had
  chance to use it I am more hopeful of success. It is important to
  empty these humidifiers regularly and clean them, I forgot for a
  few days and was horrified at the build up of slimy stuff and the
  smell of mould in such a short time</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I bought this as a Christmas present for my
  4-year-old daughter. She is a huge My Little Pony fan. Ponyville
  lives in our house in fact. We got it out and played with it for
  a couple hours. We didn't have the problems described with the
  hand crank. That seems to be very durable. The problem is with
  the flower that Zippee goes in. A pony steps on the flower to
  open the flower and then you wind the gear counter clockwise to
  close it. After a couple hours, the flower petals are now broken
  and can't be repaired. Toys certainly don't have the quality in
  them that they used to. Hasbro's quality in general has declined.
  This was demonstrated in the newest My Little Pony Castle as
  well. This toy has some neat features. The crank works well and
  the braiding mechanism is useful. The Breezie that lives in the
  flower goes along with the story in the My Little Pony video
  series. The colors are vivid and bright. I would have liked to
  suggest that the pink stage that the Daffidazey stands on should
  have had built-in storage to hold the hair accessories. Some
  additional clips would also have been a nice addition to this
  set. 4 clips for a set that is designed to do all your ponies'
  hair is a bit skimpy. The braids are nice and tight and even a
  young child can operate this toy....with a bit of assistance.
  (Hint: Putting suction cups or velcro hook and loop on the bottom
  makes it even easier for little ones to play with minimal adult
  assistance)</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This is the French X-rated version of 99
  women, directed by Jess Franco. The running time of this feature
  is 98 minutes, which means that this is probably the longest,
  least censored version of the film that is available. The story
  involves a women`s island prison, a sadistic female warden, a
  lustful male governor, and the young, lovely female inmates. Can
  you see where this is heading ? There ARE scenes of extreme
  sexuality (especially when you consider the film was released in
  1969) which include (...). My big problem with this movie is that
  the hardcore scenes are haphazardly edited into the film. In a
  few cases, they don`t even seem to be part of the scenes that you
  have been watching. Also frustrating is the fact that some of the
  actors taking part in the sex scenes look nothing like the actors
  that they are doubling (standing-in)for. Just because a woman is
  wearing a blonde wig does not mean she is going to look like the
  lead actress that she is portraying. I guess that this movie was
  pushing the boundaries in 1969, but looking at the dumb story,
  lousy editing, and sex scenes from a 2005 perspective.....this is
  just a dated curio</Text>

  <Text category="book">This is one of those books where you actually
  feel embarrassment for the author. The book is poorly researched,
  poorly written and, well, words just fail me. While I am not a
  great Herriot fan, I do have to give him his due - the man could
  write well and could tell a good story (isn't that what authors
  are suppose to do?) but this guy Graham Lord, I suspect, has
  problems feeding paper into his typewriter! The intire book is
  such an obvious ploy to make some money on the shirttail of a
  &amp;amp;quot;dead&amp;amp;quot; and popular author, it is rather
  nauseating. Shame on the publisher for accepting such shoddy
  work! I did finish the book though (thank God I did not purchase
  the thing) because each page became worse and worse and I could
  not stop, thinking with each turn of the page &amp;amp;quot;well
  it just cannot be any worse than that last
  page/chapter.&amp;amp;quot; How wrong I was! If you must read the
  thing, borrow it or check it out of a library. I would hate to
  see a person waste their money, and I certainly would not want
  the author and his publisher to be rewarded for a work such as
  this. Herriot's life, warts and all, could be such a fastinating

  CD in the hope that the family connection would ensure similar
  quality of the music. Disappointingly, I've found this album
  really grates on me after a couple of songs. Peggy's vocal style
  in particular becomes mighty annoying to listen to over the
  length of the album, as her delivery can best be described as a
  neo-hillbilly twang. I may end up combining the best half-dozen
  songs from this album with some other folk albums to generate a
  listenable &amp;amp;quot;best-of&amp;amp;quot; set, but I'd find
  it unthinkable to listen to this entire set in one sitting. Only
  devoted fans of the genre or the duo should invest in this set;
  more casual fans of folk should direct their dollars to any of
  Pete's fine albums such as the Carnegie Hall classic</Text>
  <Text category="book">If you have not read the book, then this movie
  may intrigue you. It is quirky and interesting to say the least.
  As a storyline it does not lack imagination. From Maine to Vienna
  to NYC and back to Maine, from the Jew-hating German tourists to
  the radicals and the [...], from one Hotel New Hampshire to
  another, the dreams of a father and his colourful family unfold
  in a series of bizarre and at times disturbing events. And life
  appears to be a fairy tale that we live as we chase our dreams.
  Now, in relation to the actual book, this movie can be described
  with just one word: RUSHED. The adaptation is so faithful that it
  tries to cover almost everything, all characters and all events,
  thereby failing miserably to project the sentiment behind the
  eccentric story of this highly unusual family. I could go on and
  on about how the accurate quotes from the original text fall flat
  on a screenplay that comes across truncated and patched together
  clumsily, how the scenes lack emotional depth, how the characters
  are not given enough time to be adequately developed... but I
  will instead characterise the whole attempt as noble but short.
  If the book was a long wave-like function, with a rise to a
  crest, then a drop followed by a building surge and another rise
  to another crest, over and over and over again, then the movie
  was just a cross-section of the top parts of this rollercoaster
  of a wave-like function, shaving off all the crests and placing
  them in a two hour blender, where they were shaken and served to
  please God knows what. Surely not the potential of this
  fascinatingly bizarre book, nor its undercurrent and extremely
  subtle magical tone. And it was not for lack of effort. It was
  for lack of realism on how to put on screen a highly bizzare
  story in a way that flows smoothly rather than jump spastically
  between scenes. A mini series would have worked much better for
  such a faithful adaptation. Either that or a more free-flowing
  interpretation that could possibly make sense within the 120
  minutes that are usually allocated to a motion picture. Thank God
  for Jodie Foster's and Beau Bridges's performances, who bring
  Fanny and Win Berry to life. Keep passing the open windows and
  read the book for a much richer and meaningful experience. As far
  as this movie is concerned, just toss it out as far as you can.
  And if you are to keep it, then do so to remind yourselves of how
  to NOT adapt a great book onto the screen. This is the only
  reason why I keep mine</Text>

  <Text category="music">This recording is not great company. I'm
  really confused: is it a Broadway recording or a very poor
  amatuer recording? And if so, did this rubbish actually make it
  to the Broadway stage? I feel for the people that saw it, and
  were expecting the rich full melodies that Sondheim produced for
  this show. The Musical Director for this abomination should be
  called a Mutilation Director, because that is precisely what he
  did to the music of this show. So the only advice I give to
  future Musical Directors that want to revive and revamp a show:
  If it's not broke, please, please, please don't try and fix it!
  Some things are just perfect the way they are. Don't buy this CD.

  album more than one star. Luckily I got this cd for free when
  they were handing them out to everyone who came to their shows on
  their 2005 tour. I love classic Journey, but this band has gone
  downhill faster than I ever thought possible. Most of the songs
  are terrible-boring music and even worse lyrics. 'Arrival' was
  pretty mediocre, but this is about 5 steps DOWN from there.
  Granted, Steve Augeri does complete justice to the old songs in
  concert and really sounds great, but he obviously has nothing to
  offer in the way of songwriting. The only way this band will ever
  create quality new music is if Perry were to stop sitting around
  at home and come back to the band. Otherwise, the band should
  seriously consider not making any more new music and just go on

  <Text category="book">This book was on a very interseting topic. The
  author took time in studying this topic. It was about the
  impending world oil shortage. That is the time when we, the
  world, will run out of oil. It tells you about Hubbert's analysis
  of the time or year when the world will run out of oil. They then
  talk about a lot of other things like where oil comes from. Then
  they talk about where oil is. They also talk about drilling for
  oil. They say it takes people over 20 drills to find oil.
  sometimes it will take even more time then that. Then they talk
  about the size of oil fields. They also reexamine Hubbert's
  analysis later on in the book. Rate plots is brought up because
  the more people driving the less oil we will have in the future.
  They talk about the future to fossil fuels and discuss elctricity
  and natural gases. They also talk about how much we already have
  so when oil runs out we need to think about all the stuff we
  already have. Hubbert was a brilliant man. some gas companys
  tried to make him stay quiet but he didn't want to he told
  everybody. The author was ver knowledgable and I could tell he
  knew what he was talking about. I wouldn't recommend this book to
  anybody unless they are very smart and want to know about the
  impending world oil shortage. I say again the author took time in
  studying this topic but that was his downfall in that he went
  into to much depth and made it boring. When you read it you can
  tell the author knew what he was talking about but he got to much
  into detail which is very boring. I gave it a low rating because

  <Text category="music">..of little teenage white girls trying to
  sound like thirty-year-old black women. First it was Britney
  Spears, then it was Christina Aguilera, now it's Joss Stone. The
  former at least have something going for them; Britney's first
  album had catchy beats, and even though Aguilera's style is
  incredibly trashy, she does have enormous vocal power and range
  if she would only stop trying so hard. Try as I might, though, I
  just don't understand the appeal of Joss Stone. I didn't buy this
  album; a friend of mine likes it and I've had to listen to it
  enough times to want to rip my ears right out of my head. I don't
  see what is fresh or original about ripping off Janis Joplin and
  the generally much more talented black soul singers. Maybe it's
  the Rick Astley effect: you don't expect THAT voice coming out of
  THAT face. You don't expect a squinty little teenaged blonde to
  growl and screech like a deranged cat. But that effect can only
  take you so far, as Rick Astley himself found out. This album is
  not only an unpleasant listening experience because of the stupid
  songs ("Dirty Man" basically just repeats "You're a dirty man..."
  with very minor variations, along with a great deal of
  unnecessary caterwauling) and the nails-down-a-chalkboard voice
  of Stone herself - it's a depressing reminder of how low our
  culture has sunk, when it can't come up with any culture based on
  its own heritage but slavishly copycats things from another
  culture that seems more "cool". Stone, like Aguilera and Spears,
  tries to sing like an older black woman, a woman with soul - an
  Aretha Franklin or a Gloria Gaynor. But Stone et al. sound like
  little girls clattering around in grown-up shoes. They haven't
  been alive long enough to live similar experiences of the women
  they are trying to imitate. Their singing rings hollow to me,
  show-offy and fake. Stone could rival Aguilera in shameless and
  unnecessary vocal theatrics, though she has nowhere near
  Aguilera's sweetness or range. Her voice might be described as
  "smoky" by some; to me it sounds gravelly, sandpapery, and as
  pleasant as scraping your knees on asphalt. I don't understand
  why anyone in the right mind would willingly put themselves
  through the ordeal of listening to this CD, much less enjoy it. I
  guess fake is good enough for some people. It makes me chuckle,
  though, to hear people rave about her voice as "authentic". If
  you're looking for soul, try Macy Gray. She's for real. Try the
  hugely talented but woefully ignored Tasmin Archer and Karen
  Rodriguez. Those are fresh, authentic voices that will make you
  realize what a load of bollocks Joss Stone and her ilk truly are.
  The only white woman I have ever heard who could sing like she
  was black was Linda Ronstadt. Go back and listen to a Ronstadt
  classic like "Hurts So Bad" and compare it to this modern-day
  drivel. Ronstadt sang with real feeling, real knowledge, real
  pain - worlds apart from this fake plastic imitation of soul that
  seems to be the rule and not the exception these days. I gave
  this one star because there is no zero-stars option. Joss Stone
  is just a musical Chav, an unconvincing shoplifter of another,
  better culture</Text>

  <Text category="book">After reading this book, it was apparent to me
  that the author was implying that Nixon was a dark and grumpy man
  who needed his image repackaged. McGinnis boasts of Nixon and his
  PR teams ability to hide the &amp;amp;quot;true&amp;amp;quot;
  Nixon and to trick the public into voting for his image. He
  proclaims that the real Nixon was the one that the country saw
  debating Kennedy on TV in 1960. Nothing could be further from the
  truth. First off, Nixon won the 1960 election but did not contest
  the results for the good of the nation. All historians admit that
  JFK had help from Daily in Illinois and LBJ in Texas.
  Furthermore, in the 1960 debates, Nixon had a high fever and was
  recently out of the hospitable and JFK's staff broke into the
  basement of the studio and turned up the heat to make him sweat!
  If anyone decieved the voters with his image, it was JFK using
  his dramatic but bubbly rhetoric and not backing it up and JFK
  the family man and the idealist. JFK exploited the Missile Gap,
  had numerous affairs, assassinated Ngo Dihn Diem, wire tapped
  Martin Luther King, screwed up the Bay of Pigs, and had ties to
  the Mafia! Now, I could be wrong, but JFK's campaign sounds like
  a true selling of the President. 'Selling of the President' has
  little credible content but infact is a good historical document
  that portrays Left Wing propaganda of the 1960s</Text>

  <Text category="book">First of all, I did not exactly 'read' this
  biography. Instead I purchased the CD version which I distilled
  via my car sound system every morning on my way to work (I have
  enjoyed countless biographies of great american figures this way,
  and still been able to read many more technology related books).
  I had great expectations from this book, having recently enjoyed
  three biographies of Lincoln. I have to confess that I was sorely
  disapointed. I found the research of Mr McCullough to lack the
  kind of details that I have enjoyed in biographies from Walter
  Isaacson, Richard Carwardine, or Doris Goodwin. I do not seek a
  beautiful story in a biography, but rather a reliable source of
  facts that I can use to form my own opinion of a character. In
  this context, I find Mr McCullough's use of superlatives or long
  emotionally charged sentences to be a distraction from the
  subject matter of John Adams and his contribution to America. I
  also enjoy direct quotes from letters, speaches, autobiographies,
  as they help me refine my impressions of the context (the period,
  the relationships to contemporary characters, ...) surounding a
  promonent figure. Usage of the English language in politics has
  dramatically evolved since Mr Adams' time, and I missed 'hearing'
  the voice of John Adams. Instead, this biography felt like
  reading a translation where the personality of the translator
  overshadows the personality of the original author. Finally,
  having read other biographies of the founding fathers, I was
  disapointed to find so little about the complex relationship
  between Adams and Franklin. All in all, my lasting impression is
  that Mr McCullough did a great job at bringing John Adams and the
  early American Revolution to the masses through a very appealling
  product that may however leave readers asking for more historical
  details and less emotional opinions. Had I known that, I might
  have passed on this biography and instead explore Mr McCullough's
  fictional work</Text>

  <Text category="book">I really wanted to like this book and the
  beginning started out great. A shocking murder is committed in
  the town of Newpointe, then another. Meanwhile, fireman Mark
  Branning has moved out and is separated from his wife Allie.
  There is a serial killer targeting the wives of firemen and Allie
  and Mark must fight through their struggles for the sake of their
  marriage. I wanted to like this book because it is a Christian
  novel with a good purpose. Ninety percent of the books I've read
  have been secular but I'm starting to read more Christian novels.
  But to me, this book fails for three reasons: the marriage
  conflict between Mark and Allie isn't believable, the serial
  killer plot collapses under its own weight, and the spiritual
  message is confusing and disappointing. Mark and Allie's marriage
  is suffering because she thinks he had an affair and he hasn't
  convinced her otherwise. Seeing your husband hugging another
  woman is not proof of adultery, but it is grounds for suspicion.
  Yet, Allie assumes Mark is cheating on her because she witnessed
  him hugging another woman. It seems to me the truth would be
  discovered in the resulting fight. Instead, Mark and Allie
  separate and Allie sees no hope for her marriage because of that
  hug and what she assumes was an affair. Blackstock does a poor
  job of framing the conflict between Mark and Allie. Throughout
  the book, references are made to Allie believing Mark had an
  affair with Issie. Allie refers to Mark's act as "adultery" and
  recalls him "lying" his way out of it after Allie caught him
  hugging Issie. Their marriage is struggling, but Blackstock
  should have given more reasons why Allie assumed adultery other
  than a hug because throughout the book, Mark says he didn't have
  an affair and Allie chalks it up to one of his lies. Later in the
  novel, Blackstock gives more reason for their conflict but by
  then its too late. The serial killer story is poorly done, and it
  also seems everybody knows everybody in this book. When they book
  a suspect at the end, it seems ridiculous. The police work feels
  like it was written by an amateur. One line in the novel, "As
  much as the evidence pointed to XXX, Stan didn't want to believe
  it." In my opinion, the evidence didn't point to that person and
  Stan, the detective, seems foolish for believing it. There isn't
  any rhythm or flow to the police work or the serial killer in the
  story. There is no sense of setting in the book. There are too
  many characters that no each other yet little context in how they
  know each other. Finally, this book talks about God and prayer
  and being "saved" throughout the book, and that's great. With a
  serial killer on the loose, a lot of bad things are happening and
  the characters react to this in a bad way. At one point, a
  conversation goes like this: "How can the murder be part of God's
  plan?" "Maybe it isn't" "That would mean God isn't in control."
  "He is in control, but he allows some things to happen." Then at
  another point, Mark says to Allie, "I'm going to be fine, it's
  time to trust the Lord. He's taken care of us so far." Then Allie
  says: "But I don't know what his plan is. I don't know how he
  wants this to end. I don't know what he wants to teach us." At
  other points in the book, characters say that God has a plan and
  maybe the serial killer is part of God's plan and that through
  God's plan, all things can be used for good. This line of logic
  is infuriating. Bad things happen to everyone, including God's
  people. God doesn't "allow" a serial killer to shoot and burn
  your wife. That's a horrible message to send to a non-Christian
  who may have lost someone in a car wreck. Telling them it was
  part of God's plan is the quickest way to turn someone from God.
  God is obviously there for people when something bad happens to
  help them through it and to find the good in it and God can even
  keep bad things from happening to Christians. But like above,
  where Allie was afraid because she thought God might have chosen
  to have her killed to teach a lesson, God doesn't willfully kill
  people. It comes down to the simple fact that all people,
  including serial killers and Christians, have choices to make and
  have free will. I'm surprised I wrote so much on an 8 year old
  book but I wanted it to be a good book.</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">During my teenage years I was a fan of WWF
  wrestling and specifically, the Rock. He was a tremendous
  wrestler who the fans admired right away because of his talent to
  be extremely funny on the microphone and cut some of the
  funniest, most disgusting lines ever mentioned on WWF TV. His
  talent in the ring was spot-on, and the Rock would always give
  the people everything he had when it came time to step in the
  ring and compete. He rarely made a mistake in the ring... but he
  made a HUGE mistake stepping away from wrestling and walking down
  the path to Hollywood. It's not that Doom is really a bad movie.
  Sure, it was a movie considered a disappointment right from the
  get go because no one wanted to watch it at the movie theaters.
  It's just a normal, monster-shooting film that delivers a tiny
  amount of suspense, and that's it. I'm sure the movie would've
  been big had it been released 10 years ago. Todays generation is
  probably sick of go-nowhere do-nothing action films such as Doom.
  Okay, so it DOES go somewhere, but the film isn't really designed
  to build to an awe-inspiring creative story. Doom is the kind of
  movie you don't really want to seek out- you just happen to come
  across it at the video store and decide you need a quick
  90-minute action fix, so you rent the movie, watch it, and then
  forget about it the next morning. Of course, I'm sure you don't
  forget to rewind the tape because that's impolite. The Rock never
  should have left wrestling. It was a bad career move and the
  millions of wrestling fans (and the Rock means MILLIONS) really
  miss him. Come back home, Rock. Please</Text>

  <Text category="music">Etta never fails to deliver in the vocals.
  Gutteral bombast, sweet soul, gospel, blues, the lady is a living
  legend. But this album, like the last album "produced" by her
  son, is a nightmare. Chessy arrangments, tinkly bass, poor sound
  all around. She is a fierce mother and I'm sure she thinks her
  kids know best, but there is a reason why labels pair vocalists
  with the right producer. Should Etta get the chance to work with
  a fresh ear at the deck, she wouldn't need the novelty of some of
  the song choices. PS - 200lbs lighter and she remains the best
  live performer; blues, R/B, soul, whatever, in the world.</Text>
  <Text category="book">This book, up to the very end was very good.
  With out a doubt a three star book maybe three and a half. The
  end is what ruins the entire thing. Don't worry I'm not going to
  spoil anything. I'll just say the ending stinks out loud! This
  story is not really horror, its SiFi. A adventure/drama/SiFi. It
  really should have been about 100 to 200 pages longer. Everything
  in it was really cool and fun to read but it just seemed rushed.
  And somethings were not really dove into thoroughly enough. The
  writting was dead on as always and character development was
  good. This book just needed another couple hundred pages to go
  from a barley average book to a great book</Text>
  <Text category="book">I enjoyed the parts regarding the S.S.
  Valiant, but the later part of the book simply didn't work for
  me. Except for Picard, who we of course know quite well from the
  series, the other characters were flat and uninteresting. We
  never find out what is motivating the alien attackers and they
  are the cardboard cutout enemy-of-the-week, boring. The whole
  &amp;amp;quot;adversarial&amp;amp;quot; situation with the 1st
  Officer also just struck me as odd and wrong, and was just not
  developed correctly or fleshed out beyond being another cardboard
  enemy for Picard</Text>

  <Text category="book">While the author does go into detail about
  numerous topics and informs the reader about what is necessary to
  survive. What I think the books lacks is the detail necessary on
  all of the major topics. An example would be that he describes
  how to build a leanto for shelter, but doesn't go into detail on
  how to tie the structural members together. He just tells you
  that you need to tie them together. What if you don't have a
  shoelace to use? What other alternates are there? This book would
  be great for a teenager who goes camping and may need to build a
  fire, but it's not enough for the serious camper</Text>

  <Text category="book">The only redeeming points of this book are the
  few conversations that the author has with his uncle. The rest is
  just quotations from other books. There is enough original
  material here for about a chapter and a half. The author was set
  on making a book out of it so he just padded it with things that
  other authors had said. I read it to the end though. Probably
  because the author has a very nice writing style. He is probably
  a good playwrite though I have never read any of his plays. He
  just didn't have enough material for a book here. I'm surpised it
  got published</Text>
  <Text category="music">I love to hear old standards and such. But I
  like to hear people who put their own take on it. I can't stand
  to hear cheesy big band arrangements with some Frank Sinatra
  wannabe. Where are the male versions of Nora Jones? Tone down the
  cheese! We need more people like sophisticated Shirley Horn and
  Betty Carter(NOT hams like Buble, Dusk, or boring singers like
  Diana Krall. But what can I expect from the music industry?
  Rarely do the best song-stylists get lots of attention. So, hmmm,
  nevermind. I guess it's always been that way</Text>
  <Text category="book">I originally had to read this book for a
  History of Rock and Roll class at the University of Cincinatti. I
  found the subject interesting, and the professor gave wonderful
  lectures. I had good expectations about this book going in, but
  those quickly soured as I read it. It seems correct, at least,
  about the social problems of the different eras and their
  relation to rock. Not that such is a particularly daunting feet.
  However, it is rife with laughable fallacies. For instance, it
  calls David Bowie, amongst other glam rock bands of the era,
  metal. It futher goes on to call many pop bands of the 60s and
  70s rock, when they have no guitar work and no bass line at all,
  such as the Carpenters. I really had a good laugh when they
  called Bad Religion hardcore. Bad Religion is about as hardcore
  as Elvis is rap. Further massive genre confusion consisted
  throughout the entire book. I also noted several drastic
  misinterpretations of songs. For instance, it claims 'Thunder
  Rolls' by Garth Brooks is about domestic violence. Its about
  infedility, not focusing on violence at all, but rather the
  emotional ramificationsof being cheated on. The writing is also
  rather dry. Many times it is merely a citing of the names of band
  members as well as constantly describing minor changes in bands
  lineups which are of no true consequence. It also tends to list
  off songs which have no impact on any giving band's successes or
  failures. After reading the book in completetion, I really had to
  question the earlier passages about older rock and blues (50s to
  60s) that I had thought were true. In the end, I felt that it
  wasted my time and money and possibly misinformed me more than
  anything</Text>

  However, when thawing these bags out I found that I was losing

  tried some of the other bags out there and found that yes, these
  bags are better than their competitors, but they were not good

  <Text category="dvd">In the Golden Age of Hollywood, each studio
  usually took a stab all various genres, but excelled in only one.
  Warner Brothers cornered gangster films, with forays into
  musicals (Busby Berkeley) and noir (Bogart). Universal dabbled in
  lots of B-films, but succeeded big-time with horror. MGM, of
  course, produced the best musicals. Fox did melodramas ---
  especially noir --- with an occasional romp on MGM's musical
  turf. And usually those romps hit some really bad notes. Witness
  the first three flicks in their Marquee Musicals series. Daddy
  Long Legs has Astaire and Caron, Pin-Up Girl has Betty Grable,
  Week-End in Havana has Alice Faye and Carmen Miranda, The memory
  of these films, for the most part, is a lot better than the films
  themselves. The pleasant but fairly pedestrian scores, thin plots
  and busy character actors scurrying around propping up the story
  make for rough going. And make one yearn for Mickey and
  Judy</Text>
  <Text category="music">This album is a real let down and it pains me
  to say so, since I really do like the KOL. The first 2 cds were
  catchy and they rocked. I didn't care if they were singing about
  groupie sex or street brawling. It didn't matter because the
  songs were great.But on this cd they've opted for an experimental
  sound that doesn't measure up. Innovative is one thing but that
  shrill screech in Charmer-what the heck is up with that? How
  often do you want to listen to it? Once was enough for me. I
  wasn't expecting the Pixies here. And then there's the reverb
  employed on song after song-why? It just degenerates into white
  noise. There are a couple of good tracks on the dics- Black
  Thumbnail, for one. But then there are throwaway tunes like
  Camaro, which is about as clique as you can get. That said, art
  is subjective, and there are obviously plenty of folks who feel
  compelled to give this cd glowing reviews. But I find most of it
  unlistenable.I can think of many cds that merit a 5 star rating;
  this is definitely not one of them</Text>

  <Text category="music">Despite all reviews posted here in this page
  are given 5-stars to this release, I need to be honest and
  explain why I am giving just one poor star. No, I am not crazy.
  Let me explain my point-of-view, and after that you can decide if
  this JH album really deserves more stars. Just to start, this
  album does not have a spinal-column that could guide the band(?)
  or the musicians thru a solid path. There are tracks played by a
  duo, trio, 4tt, and sometimes a very loose quintet, and each of
  these tracks have a different mood, without any presence of a
  jazz soul, or even a real smell of jazz. Maybe the intention of
  recording these tunes was to make a homage/tribute to Mr
  Strayhorn, or maybe a recognition for Mr Henderson value in the
  20th century Jazz History as one of the most important
  hard-boppers ever. But the result was very poor. If you really
  love Joe Henderson (as I appreciate), try any of his albums from
  the 60's (as a band-leader or as a sideman), mainly those from
  the Blue Note era. In time: I gave one star, in memory of his
  brilliant carreer. This particular album deserve
  zero-star.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">While filled with talented performers, this cd
  sucks. Rocky is a campy, 1970's B-Movie, that's what makes it
  enjoyable. Even as a stage show it's a hokey, rock-and-roll
  extravaganza. This cd tries to turn Rocky into Thoroughly Modern
  Millie, and it just doesn't work. The corny sci-fi sound and less
  than amazing vocals are just what make Rocky..Rocky. This cast
  has so much less enthusiasm and energy than the original Roxy
  cast. And lastly, Tim Curry is Frank. His rendition is too
  ingrained in my head for me to accept the twangy annoyance that
  is the Frank on this album. Ripley is a little too legit for
  Janet, and the female Eddie weirds me out. Buy the Roxy cast.
  It's so superior it's almost laughable.</Text>
  <Text category="music">I cant believe there are so many positive

  Testament fan, or those into commercial metal should pick this

  <Text category="music">As a contemporary of Joan Baez (age-wise), I
  loved her early music and the power of her incredible voice. I
  even empathize with much of her politics, but unfortunately it's
  time she rested on her laurels. Her voice on this CD is quite far
  removed from what she was once capable of, and in fact I would
  have to say that there is no comparison between her vocal ability
  on Bowery Songs, and her earlier quality. Like some professional
  athletes, she seems to not know when to quit...</Text>

  the motor strains, and the truck moves very slowly, so I'm
  concerned that the load is too much for the motor. He likes the

  <Text category="book">On our beloved Kay Scarpetta and the
  illustrious Ms. Cornwell? Having been an avid fan of her novels
  from the very beginning, I simply cannot help but ask
  myself....is she really writing this stuff? Very slow in the
  beginning, I began to fear a repeat of the struggle that I
  endured to finish Blowfly. However, this novel does begin to pick
  up momentum...but not until the reader is halfway through, and
  certainly not until this author had left me sufficiently
  disgusted. The storyline finds Scarpetta summoned home to the
  scene of the crime...Richmond, Virginia, where her previous
  employer seeks her assistance in unwraveling the mysterious death
  of a young girl. So Scarpetta---with Marino tagging along of
  course---heads back to Richmond from her new home in Florida to
  offer assistance; only to find that her old building is being
  demolished...and that the new one, under the leadership of Dr.
  Joel Marcus, is sloppy regarding policies and procedures. The
  demoralization of her former staff by Dr. Marcus is also
  unnerving to Scarpetta; and clearly he resents her intrusion. So
  why has he asked her to come? Meanwhile, Lucy, as head of The
  Last Precinct, is once again up to her ears in nonsense. For such
  a brilliant, successful young woman (as readers have always been
  lead to believe), why must Cornwell insist on making her so
  completely stupid in her literary life? In this tale she is once
  again romantically linked with a narcissistic sociopath who also
  happens to be her employee. Worse than the weak storyline, and
  the fact that this novel is just all over the place, is the
  author's disturbingly sterotypical portrayal of African-Americans
  throughout. Drug dealers are black, they're dead of gunshot
  wounds, and most ludicrous of all is in one instance Cornwell
  references a dead young man's "conspicuously large organ." Are
  you kidding me? The trash collectors are "big dark men" and of
  course in an upscale neighborhood, the "old black woman" must
  WORK in one of the houses. The author's unbelievably
  narrow-minded, stereotypical view of other races is disturbing at
  best, and frankly makes one think that she may just be as stupid
  from a common sense perspective as Lucy. Read only if you must,
  but frankly there are better ways to spend your time. DY</Text>

  <Text category="book">I clearly do not share the enthusiasm of some
  of the reviewers here, who will all have to forgive me for
  thinking that Susan Cooper's "The Dark Is Rising" is plain awful.
  This book was recommended to Harry Potter fans who have run out
  of HP books to read. I must say it was a waste of my time to read
  "Dark." Never have I read a book in which no physical description
  is given for the hero. In this case, we are told that on his 11th
  birthday, an English boy named Will Stanton discovers he is the
  last of "The Old Ones." Unlike JK Rowling who, in the first pages
  of Harry Potter &amp;amp; the Philosopher's (or Sorcerer's)
  Stone, provides the reader with a vivid description of Harry as
  skinny, with an unruly mop of black hair, startlingly green eyes,
  and, of course, a lightning-bolt scar on his forehead, Cooper
  does not describe Will Stanton at all. The result is that the
  reader, after having read 244 pages, still cannot visualize what
  Will looks like!! I also find quite annoying Cooper's approach to
  this good vs. evil tale. She is vague and abstract till the end
  as to who exactly are The Old Ones, and who or what exactly is
  The Dark. As for The Dark being evil, all the reader succeeds in
  gleaning is that The Dark means cold, snow, and--of
  course--darkness. Excuse me: but is this the best Cooper can do?
  Is this what this book is about?--the Druid pagan worldview of
  light vs. dark, summer vs. winter, warmth vs. cold? What happened
  to the conception of evil as MORAL evil?</Text>

  <Text category="book">I am reading this for a college course called
  "History of the American City". This book is a typical 'college
  texbook' in that it is FILLED with numbers, dates, percentages,
  figures, numbers, oh did I say numbers, dates, figures, and
  years, oh and plenty of numbers... The
  brilliant,dilligent,honored, and esteemed scolar of a woman that
  wrote it sure knows her numbers, facts, years, etc... I, on the
  other hand, am absolutley hating it and foolishly I have allowed
  the drop date to pass, so I have to read the book or fail the
  class. I am getting nothing from the book regarding any kind of
  understanding of any of these cities , unless I am willing to
  spend years interpreting the multitude of data the book heaps
  upon me. Needless to say, from (attempting)reading it I am
  getting a headache and don't really even have the time to write
  this review. I say that if even one person is deterred from
  reading this expose' of numbers, names, dates, figures, facts,
  percentages, orders, years, dates and more numbers, dates, facts,
  figures (are you getting my drift yet?), it will be time well
  served though.--- AVOID--- THIS--- BOOK. please -- Find another

  <Text category="book">This is a pep rally on CD; an unsingable,
  emotionally charged pep rally. It really upsets me that this is
  the face of today's Christian music. The melodies are not easily
  singable at all, and the songs use all the same musical cliches.
  This is worship manipulation at it's best. If you read the words
  to learn something concrete about God, you will find nothing of
  substance. They talk about actions to give God and our response
  to God, but no meat-and-potatoes of WHY we should be doing this.
  God IS great, but WHY? This is VERY disturbing, and completely
  unacceptable for congregational worship.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I found the singing in the soundtrack so
  utterly intolerable that I had to quit watching this after about
  20% of the video. The movie seemed like it would have been nice
  otherwise (about a 4). The sound of the singing was very grating
  &amp;amp; harsh to my ears; since it was almost continous it made
  watching the video impossible. It also seemed to add little to
  the film in terms of content. The photography &amp;amp; art

  products, but I must admit they missed the mark in improving this
  shaver. The Remington ES-1000 Utra Smooth Bump Control Shaver was
  designed to replace the original (BMS) Black Man's Shaver which
  was discountinued several years ago. I recently purchased and
  used the ES-1000 and was quite disappointed with its performance.
  The ES-1000 performed so poorly that I had to use my BMS that I
  had purchase 20 years ago to remove facial hair the ES-1000
  shaver could not and did not remove. The product should be called
  "Ultra poor with a sandpaper finish." The product needs to be put
  to death by using an ultra smooth bullet. For anyone with curly

  <Text category="book">If you like this book you will probably like
  "Bless the Child" by Cathy Cash Spellman. They are very similar.
  This book can be summed up in one word, simple: simple-minded,
  simple characters, simple plot (applied loosely), and simple
  premise. What a contrived piece of garbage! I can't describe
  everything wrong with this book because there's not enough time.
  If it's meant to be a mystery it sucks because you figure out who
  did it about halfway through. If it's meant to empower women it
  sucks because the women are either victims, in denial, weak,
  worried about what everyone thinks, or oblivious. If it's meant
  to promote animal adoptions it sucks because the author's plea
  for that is irritating. That's how bad this book is! It can make
  an animal lover say that its plea for more animal adoptions was
  annoying. This author has no style. The book reads like an
  episode of inside edition. There is no immersion into the story.
  The total lack of character development leaves you with no
  compassion for them. As a reader I felt completely outside the
  story; an uncaring observer of a poorly described scenario. The
  attempts to tug at my heartstrings were laughable. I've been more
  moved by the appearance of colorful weeds on my lawn. The only
  reason I read the whole thing was that my neighbor recommended it
  and loaned it to me. Do not waste your time. I must say though
  that this novel was inspirational. If this crap can make the best

  <Text category="dvd">While "Scary Movie 4" does work in getting out
  a couple of laughs, it certainly does not live up to the past
  three. Many of the jokes that were used are redundant and
  frankly, are getting pretty old. Although this movie had a lot of
  different material to work with such as The Grudge, Saw, and War
  of the Worlds, it misses the funny mark just by a bit.
  Personally, I felt they could have done a LOT more in terms of
  parodying these films, particularily with The Grudge. The writers
  should have taken more advantage of the content they had to spoof
  in order to have made this film a lot more funnier. And really,
  was it necessary to spoof films such as Brokeback Mountain and
  Millionaire Dollar Baby, both of which are not horror films? I
  believe the comedy in this film is aimed towards a more mature
  audience, and is vastly different from what Scary Movies 1
  &amp;amp; 2 offered (which I found to be extremely hilarious). If
  you're looking for over the top funny, look towards the other
  Scary Movies</Text>
  <Text category="music">I picked this up because a) it's Boz Scaggs, a
  guy whose records I wore out when they first hit, and b) it's
  full of great old songs. BUT: Boz sounds like he's doing
  something else, maybe surfing the internet or looking out the
  window, when he sings. Hard to imagine that the man who punched
  out "Lido" can sound so half-asleep performing great material. A
  washed-out, almost depressing performance. There are many much
  better renditions of these classic songs. I imagine it's hard to
  come up with new material, but please, if you're going to do
  these songs at least sing as if you're awake. No emotion, no
  involvement. And to add annoyance to injury, Boz somehow found
  the world's worst drummer for this session. If you can tap your
  fork on a tabletop you can play the cymbals and traps as well as
  him, incessantly dopey and grindingly repetitive. Pass on this
  one</Text>
  <Text category="book">I read this book on a suggestion from a
  friend, before I read "Reviving Ophelia", because she wanted to
  see if I would be as dissapointed with it as she was. I was more
  so. While there are some outstanding essays in this collection,
  the bias of the editor clearly stands out. There is no one for
  the outcasts to relate to. There was no musician, nor was there
  anyone that dealt with an alternative religion. There were no
  essays from people who had a different relationship with their
  parents than she had. The sections are poorly named and divided.
  All in all, it is an unworthy book to be associated with the
  original. Some girls it may "make feel less alone", but for me it
  only accentuated the differences. Definately take out from the
  library before you buy it</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This particular DVD edition of Nosferatu is an
  excellent example of the importance of music in setting a film's
  mood. I'm not sure when this "score" was "written", although it
  is far from effective in depicting the time period of the film.
  Nor does it convey the proper mood in many points during the
  film. With this edition's music, I got confused at times between
  what I saw and what I heard, and the whole thing became an
  unaffective joke after a while. If you want an affective,
  edge-of-the-seat experience out of Nosferatu, I reccomend another
  edition.</Text>
  <Text category="book">This book was so simplistic. I was quite
  disappointed. You get the impression his main goal was simply to

  but when discussing something as complex as sexual fantasies I
  really think one should try to pursue things to their limit. He
  really held back from delving into any dark territory. His
  explanations for why someone enjoys certain things left out quite
  a bit. He always managed to put a happy, positive spin on
  everything, which is nice, but life isn't that simple</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My son was so excited for this toy. It was all

  planets are alligned. Then the "safety" bobber is so safe it
  doesn't even open when it hits the water, but does cause such a
  large ripple in the lake that all fish are gone for hours. My son
  set it down after a hour of frustration and had me trek to the
  car to grab is old trusty fishing rod, that is not as colorful
  and plastic but does actually cast and catch fish. Don't get me
  wrong, I think the rod is a gret idea but the people who designed
  it did a very slipshoddy job, and I would warn anyone about
  spending money on it.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">The CD came without a CD case and the CD did

  <Text category="dvd">What a disaster. Stay away from this film. I
  was so disappointed--how could this have won the Academy Award?!
  The story is rambling and confused, as if the filmmakers couldn't
  decide what story they wanted to tell. The animation is very
  average, with the exception of a few striking scenes of natural
  landscapes. In fact, those all-important "happy feet" of the main
  character just kind of jerk and slide around a bit. (That's
  supposed to be tap-dancing? that's supposed to be "animation?")
  The jokes aren't particularly funny (with the exception of a few
  moments in the middle where Robin Williams briefly shines). And
  oddly enough for a film whose central conceit centers on music
  and dancing, there's not a single original song, or even an
  inspired remake of any of the songs. Think "Billy Elliot" meets
  "The March of the Penguins" with some of Gore's "An Inconvenient
  Truth" mixed in--without any of the wit, charm, intelligence,
  passion, or beauty in any of those films. (Did I mention that
  this film is a disaster?) Perhaps most annoyingly, like the rest
  of the story, the underlying political message alternates between
  cliched, confused, and heavy-handed. The ending is especially
  unbearable, with its tacked-on feel and absurd
  psuedo-environmentalist feel-good solution. What a joke!
  Personally, I consider myself quite liberal and sympathetic to
  environmentalist positions (I've been a vegetarian for more than
  20 years, and a member of Sierra Club and PETA, for example), yet
  the way this movie presents its misguided message offended me
  greatly--not least because of the utter inconsistency and
  incomprehensibility of the message. One final note for those of
  you with children: this is not really a kids movie. Most of the
  jokes won't be understood by children under 15. For kids under 6,
  all this feeble film offers is some too-scary "Shamus" (orcas), a
  terrifyingly ferocious sea lion inexplicably made to growl like a
  dinosaur and given outsized teeth in a deformed mouth, and a
  jarring ending that suddenly switches to live-action scenes where
  adults heatedly debate environmental action in such kid-friendly
  forums as the United Nations! (What the heck?!) After sitting
  through the entire film to this point, my four-year-old son
  finally turned to me and quietly said, "This is not a movie for
  me." I couldn't have agreed more</Text>
  <Text category="music">This record kind of sucks, but that's okay,
  because it doesn't suck in the way where you think
  &amp;amp;quot;oh hell we'll never get a good album out of this
  guy again&amp;amp;quot; (like, for instance, Rod Stewart's latest
  garbage), because, I think, it's not really Lou's fault. The
  problem is Lou's trying to draw his material from somewhere else,
  in this case a mediocre poet. We've always been willing to
  overlook his (Poe's) considerable lack of talent (example:
  &amp;amp;quot;in there stepped a stately raven of the saintly
  days of yore&amp;amp;quot;) because he's so damn charismatic.
  Morbidly charismatic, but charismatic nonetheless. The danger is
  that too many people consider his pure dumb fun to be art (which
  I guess makes him a lot like the Rolling Stones). Lou, who's
  always shown himself to be a poet but a poet with a wink, has now
  chosen an artist who is basically Bernie Taupin with a better
  vocabulary to be his kindred spirit, and from someone who, Velvet
  genius notwithstanding, produced revolutionary and stunning works
  like Transformer, Metal Machine Music, and Berlin, this
  self-effacing friendship is the real tragedy</Text>
  <Text category="health">I bought this product for my children because
  it looked neat! What they don't tell you is that the paint must

  product hardly spins. If we could get it to work, it seemed like
  a neat concept. But it just doesn't work. I have no idea if it is
  because it needs very thin paint or the motor is weak or what. We

  <Text category="dvd">I'm going to have to disagree with the
  majority of the reviews on this movie. I have seen plenty of
  Russian films, and many of them have been slow and entirely
  reliant upon the emotional component. Mikhalkov, for example, is
  a director who can do this. This movie suffers from pretentious
  screenwriting, and a lack of underlying meaning or moral lesson.
  although the acting isn't necessarily bad, you don't get attached
  to the characters. I got the feeling that the cinematography and
  the colors didn't match the movie's theme and plot. At times it
  got so boring that i wanted to stop watching, even though i never
  do that. Anyway, I do not recommend this movie. IF you want to
  watch some good russian movies, go with "Brother", "Burnt By The
  Sun", "Prisoner of THe Mountains", "War", or "Unfinished Piece
  for the Mechanical Piano</Text>

  enjoy. There were very few activities my 6 year old daughter was
  able to understand &amp;amp; play. It is too advanced &amp;amp;
  difficult to use for the ages listed. The screen on the monitor
  was low graphics &amp;amp; poor lighting quality as well. This is
  a very expensive mistake that provided no benefit or fun to my

  <Text category="toys_games">I am a breast cancer survivor and I find this
  pink dressed, blond "doll" of perfection rather insulting to my
  female self, the perfect perky boobs, the long blond hair, the
  body that does not exist on a woman after the ravages of
  chemotheraphy. I can perfectly understand Mattel wanting to
  support breast cancer research and donate a portion of proceedes
  towards funding (and thank you for your generosity), but to do it
  under the guise of selling a "doll" which does not reflect the
  community of women who have experienced the challenges of
  recovery and survivorship...a doll which does not look like a
  survivor is literally painful and insulting! Why doesn't this
  doll have a wig? Why doesn't she have a breast removed? Why
  doesn't she have a bra fitted with a form to mimic the shape of a
  breast? What is wrong with reality? Why can't Mattel acknowledge
  the true nature of this disease and make a doll which comforts,
  not insults the sensibility of women who have suffered from this
  disease. I will purchase this doll, just because I am horrified
  by the product itself. I will disrobe her, and with a saw, cut
  off her breast so that she will look more like me, a survivor, a
  woman of pride. I will dismantle the construct of supposed beauty
  and make this image more like my own - because I am what is
  woman, not the facade of a false construction.</Text>

  Cavett produced nothing new about Hendrix. Included in the DVD
  are a few minutes of Jimi playing at Woodstock. The rest of the
  DVD is mediocre at best.</Text>
  <Text category="health">We've had a number of Gazillion bubble
  machines. The first - this one, with an upright rotating set of
  bubble wands - worked relatively well, but stopped working after
  maybe a dozen uses. (Granted, one of those uses was for a few
  hours). When the level of liquid is low, the machine stops making
  bubbles since it has to pick up enough liquid to cover the wand.
  We replaced it the next year with the Typhoon machine - this was
  awesome, produced a huge quantity of bubbles and worked more
  reliably since the bubble liquid is sucked up and put on the
  wands, no matter how low the supply of liquid. It has a large
  reservoir at the bottom so you don't need to fill it very often -
  it takes a lot of liquid though. Our issue now is getting the
  liquid. Gazillion liquid does produce the best bubbles - they
  last well, etc. etc. etc. HOWEVER, very few stores stock the
  liquid, and except for when I first bought the first machine,
  no-one stocks large size bottles. Even the online vendors like
  toys.com who are supposed to have them, never have them in stock
  (I've been on their notify list for a long time!) I've ended up
  buying from someone in Canada on eBay - otherwise, buying the
  smaller bottles at ToysRUs, Target, etc. is just too expensive.
  Both of these machines don't really work if you try other bubble
  liquids - other liquids (especially the cheaper kinds in very
  large size bottles) are much thinner and the liquid drips right
  off the wands before it has a chance to pass by the blower part
  to make any bubbles. We're planning to start making our own
  bubble liquid and hopefully that will cover us. Otherwise, the
  machines are useless now.</Text>

  along with "Zombie Madness" and the "Warrior's Triumph" structure
  decks. They all rock, but this is my favorite. And for the guy
  who gave the Winged Dragon Of Ra tip, on the bottom of the card
  it says "THIS CARD CANNOT BE USED IN A DUEL". So even if you
  happen to get one [which costs a LOT] you can't officially use
  it. Overall, this deck is very cool. I love Red Eyes Darkness
  dragon! P.S. For best results, buy the Yu-Gi-Oh! deluxe pack for

  they do: Rope Of Life PGD-105-Ultra Rare Trap Card: This card can

  "Armed Dragon LV7" This card cannot be Normal Summoned or Set.
  This card cannot be Special Summoned except by the effect of
  "Armed Dragon LV5". Send 1 monster card from your hand to the
  Graveyard to destroy all face-up monsters on your opponent's side
  of the field with an ATK equal to or less than the ATK of the
  sent monster. Add this the deck for an amazing combo! Start off
  by setting a Masked Dragon card in defense mode. When your
  opponent destroys it, use its effect to summon "Armed Dragon
  LV3". During your Standby Phase, Send it to the graveyard to
  Special Summon "Armed Dragon LV5". Then use it to attack your
  opponent's monster which is most likely destroyed. Then when you
  end your turn use its effect to special summon "Armed Dragon LV7"
  from your hand OR deck! You now have a 2800 atk points on the
  field! Sweet! And its effect is soooooooooo cool. I put the "Rope
  Of Life" card in my "Warrior's Triumph" structure deck. It helps
  out a lot! I hope you will make the right choice in buting this
  deck or the more preferable deluxe pack. Yu-Gi-Oh! Your

  this one and Derailed and Replicant and Knock Off, come of Van

  has Van Damme after Mickey Rourke who Rourke ends up killing him
  or he thinks he killed him, then Van Damme goes to an island of
  lost dead agents and villians(corny). he escapes retardedly and
  then goes back to save his wife and his up and coming child(who
  Van Damme and Rodman almost indanger the poor kid, bastards). Van
  Damme gets help from puke and choke Rodman and they have awesome
  adventures and eat lots of candy, no wait, thats what I was
  thinking and then, no. but there's some, I SAID SOME, good

  <Text category="book">This is the sort of book for paranoid people
  addicted to conspiracy theories. They would rather believe a
  fanciful lie than the mundane truth. Though I don't agree with
  most of what's written in this book, I don't regret buying it. It
  teaches me how to con ignorant people with high tech jargon and
  conspiracy theories. If people BELIEVE that amalgams or metal
  restorations are the cause of their headaches, fatigue or
  whatever symptoms, then removing them will definitely cure them.
  That's how faith healing works. The only reason why I don't use
  amalgam in my practice is because I do cosmetic dentistry. If the
  patient does not mind the colour, amalgam is definitely a
  superior direct filling material for Class 2 and subgingival
  preps. I have absolutely no qualms about having that done for
  myself. Toxicity? Sure, some people are affected by amalgams and
  anything can be toxic to somebody, but let's not forget that
  these cases are extremely rare (perhaps less than 10 on this
  planet and most of them would be Chinese). There are literally
  thousands of tests and studies establishing amalgams as safe
  filling materials over the last 100 years. There are numerous
  studies that show how safe amalgams are. If Dr Breiner has been
  to Asia where we have much healthier diets and lifestyles, he may
  notice that we also have many healthy 70 to 90-year-old Asian men
  and women who have gold and amalgam-filled teeth in their mouths.
  Are composites totally safe? The incidence of allergic reactions
  to composites (very low) is higher than that of amalgam toxicity.
  This is something the author failed to inform us. All his
  anecdotal evidence are almost laughable as they are not supported
  by independent studies and sceptical parties. Not one case he
  mentioned can be conclusively attributed to amalgam. Mercury can
  be very toxic, but after tituration and amalgamation, the metal
  remains in the solid state and is not absorbed by the body. It's
  different from inhaling mercury vapour daily, injecting or
  ingesting mercury or mercuric compounds. At the end of the day,
  propagating such beliefs will only spark panic, paranoia and
  various psychosomatic "illnesses". Following Breiner's protocols
  for "detox", patients will only be paying a fortune for otherwise
  very simple dental work. Gosh, with so many gullible patients in
  America, I should probably move my practice to America and start
  doing amalgam detox instead of honing my skills for cutting
  crowns, bridges and sinking implants</Text>

  <Text category="music">Robin Gibb has one of the most distinctive
  voices of the 1960s. With the BEE GEES or as a solo artist he has
  enough hits to make his own live show. However, in this LIVE
  recording he chooses to recreate mostly BEE GEES hits on which he
  had a secondary role on their famous three part harmonies. Thus
  he needs the help of another lead singer, chorus and The Neue
  Philharmonie Frankfurt Orchestra. But everything goes wrong here:
  Robin's voice remains buried among a real bulk of unmixed music;
  the lead singer (no list of credits) is a poor substitute to
  Barry Gibb's famous falsetto; the female voices are not very
  inspired, to say the least; while the orchestra is frequently out
  of tune and noisy (the winds on Juliet are really unbearable).
  Post-production seems to be non-existent and the overall sound is
  chaotic. Lines notes by experts Andrew Mon Hughes and Ann
  Grootjans are interesting and illustrative, but they seem to
  belong to another album. The message from Robin Gibb seems to be
  clear: "I can do it all by myself". Well, he cannot. He should re
  listen to ONE NIGHT ONLY (1998) and check for sound, harmonies
  and production</Text>

  <Text category="toys_games">I'm more or less fine that they changed a
  murder with an object in a room to who ate the cake at what time
  with what beverage. Buying this for kids and all that. Its not as
  intuitive or intrinsicly interesting, at least to me, but
  hopefully it is to kids. However, they also changed the mechanics
  of the game from adult Clue, and not in a good way. The "room"
  variable for example, drops out. Its not relevant. Its who ait
  the cake at what time with what drink. It just feels silly to set
  up the room pieces and move from room to room if the room is
  irrelevant. The idea is probably to change the mechanics to make
  the game simpler. Well, the problem with that is it was pretty
  simple in the first place. And the change sort of makes it more
  complex in a way. You need to remember the rooms where you
  already checked tokens. Now the sheet does list the rooms, you
  could use that to check off the rooms where you checked tokens.
  But since the rooms are not otherwise relevant, its not intuitive
  to track the rooms where you checked tokens. The game is also
  incredibly cheaply constructed. For example, the "die" does not
  have numbers on it, you have to put number stickers on it. And
  the board isn't flimsy -- flimsy would be an improvement. Anyway,
  not recommended</Text>

  but the rest of the album is a tough listen I'm sorry to say. I'm
  sure you'll say a true Floyd fan would love this album, well
  maybe that's true. But for me, when Waters and Gilmour were
  together, that is the true Floyd IMO. And their reign started
  with Meddle and ended with the Wall. A brilliant 6 album run
  (Meddle, OBC, DSOTM, WYWH, Animals, The Wall). For serious

  <Text category="book">This book was a huge disappointment. Sue
  Grafton and Kinsey meander all over California but come up with
  nothing of substance. The author spent more time describing the
  decor of a hospital room than explaining the murder motive. The
  characters and their actions are bogus and contrived. For
  example, Kinsey becomes emotionally attached to a young
  prostitute she met two days before. It doesn't work because it
  isn't real. It is Sue Grafton bending her characters into
  grotesque positions as she tries to force a plot into this dull
  mess. The story makes little sense as we try to follow the
  seemingly interminable clues and innumerable side characters.
  When it was all over, I still didn't know why the murders had
  been committed. Save your eyesight! Do not bother picking up this

  <Text category="dvd">The problem with this film is I read the book.
  I was disappointed simply because `Be Cool' is an obvious
  showcase for the musical talent. The overly long dance sequence
  with John Travolta and Uma Thurman is a prime example. Somewhere
  the bulk of the story was lost--and there are some very--very
  good characters appearing in the film that would've been more
  intersing if somebody would've said, "HEY, don't forget the
  book!" But being true to the original source is not Hollywood's
  strong suit. "Be Cool" provides some popular music, some known
  faces, but without John Travolta, the movie would never have been
  made. A few laughs are provided. A couple ironic scenes show up,
  but there's too little to sustain a full-length feature.
  Basically, the project is a disservice to everyone involved. Some
  of the characters are so thin--face it--poor Christina Milian as
  Linda Moon, is reduced to being a voice that sways when she
  sings--a clichï¿½. The Rock does the best he can
  but again, `He's a gay bodyguard;' he's the brunt of insulting
  jokes offered up by a Raji, his boss [Vince Vaughn], who, in the
  book, is far more sinister--but in the film he's an idiot. Of
  course Chili is Chili. Travolta does a very nice job, and Chili's
  obviously the smartest guy in the room. Uma Thruman's performance
  is, well, not funny--not serious, not intense--not much-- at
  best, she made me shrug. I do like what Harvey Keitel did with
  Nick Carr, but there's just not enough, and all the negatives
  reflect completely on the director. Enough said there. My advice,
  watch `Get Shorty'again, or read `Be Cool.'</Text>

  Although I have not actually seen it, I know this to be true

  deplorable. Can't Michael Moore tell from the comments Charlton

  I am also unsure that Mr. Heston even said the things that the

  <Text category="music">I first became a fan of the Gorillaz with
  their excellent 2nd CD, Demon Days. The interesting thing about
  this band is that their music is so strange and so "out there"
  that when you first hear one of their CD's...it sounds like
  complete garbage. But once you listen again and again, you start
  to like it more and more. Eventually you end up really liking the
  CD. That was the case with Demon Days. After enjoying that CD
  fully, I thought I should check out the first Gorillaz CD, and I
  didn't like it all that much. There just seems to be very little
  actual songs on the CD. Way too much of it sounds like complete
  filler. There were a couple throwaway songs on Demon Days, but
  most of the stuff on that CD was great. Here, we've got songs
  that are just...boring. Nothing happens. I was waiting for the
  melody or a cool tune to occur in some of these songs, but it
  never happens. You just listen to 2-D whining into the microphone
  with dull beats in the background. (Such as on songs like New
  Genious, Man Research, and Starshine.) Some songs are nothing but
  beats with no lyrics at all, sometimes sounding just like static
  noise. Songs like this, such as Double Bass, are cool for a
  minute or two, but the song drags on for practically 5 minutes.
  It gets boring. Other songs, like 5/4, M1 A1, and Rock the House
  are catchy at first, but just don't have staying power. They get
  old. 5/4 got annoying quickly, M1 A1 and Punk lost their appeal
  quickly, and Rock the House is another song that would have been
  better if they cut about 2 minutes out of it. And songs like
  Latin Simone are just annoying. The remixes of 19-2000 and Clint
  Eastwood that end the CD are also fairly forgettable, although
  19-2000's kind of catchy on the first couple listens. There are
  some good songs here, though. Tomorrow Comes Today, Clint
  Eastwood, Gravity, 19-2000, and Left Hand Suzuki Method are cool
  songs. Slow Country's kind of cool, too. And Dracula's got an
  awesome, almost haunting sound to it, and it's really absorbing.
  Although it too, unfortuantely, loses its tune and turns to
  repetitive and aimless techno noise about half way through it.
  This small collection of good songs, though, is surrounded by a
  huge collection of filler tracks. Much of this CD just isn't
  really that good. I don't know...this CD just seemed empty. Very
  few meaningful tracks, lots of filler, and some really annoying
  and repetitive songs. Some good songs were stretched to almost
  5-minutes long, mostly given filler techno beats that ruin the
  songs. Clocking in at 72 minutes, (which makes it 22
  minutes(!)longer than Demon Days) this CD was loaded with filler
  and just not enough good stuff. People interested in The Gorillaz
  should pick up their superior follow-up, Demon Days, instead of
  this one. If I listened to this debut CD first, I probably
  wouldn't have ended up liking this band very much. The good news
  about this is that the Gorillaz have not hit a sophmore slump;
  their CDs are getting better, not worse. That is a great sign for
  the future of this awesome band.</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">The American Dream is an appealing myth, no
  doubt. The idea that anybody can come from anywhere and strike it
  rich in America sounds great. The problem, as George Carlin put
  it, is that you have to be asleep to believe in it. So instead of
  representing opportunity for everybody it has become code for
  greed at all costs. And that is where "Belly" comes in, an ode to
  thug live and all the riches that come with it. This urban drama
  stars DMX (perpetually rapping), Nas, and Method Man and they
  would have you believe that they earned their cash by selling
  drugs and pimping as opposed to selling out to record companies.
  The story barely exists and seemed like a burden for the director
  who just wanted endless shots of people having sex and smoking
  drugs. When the plot does poke its head up I picked up on a
  criminal enterprise that moved shop from Queens to Omaha. Once
  there the cops get involved and people start getting shot. One
  couple tries to escape to Africa, but find it easier said than
  done. And Tommy (DMX) is sent on a mission to kill a minister.
  But really this film is about selling a lifestyle that doesn't
  even exist. Come on now, I've known drug dealers in my day, and
  they didn't live in large gaudy mansions . . . rap stars do.
  Rather they live in shacks or their parent's basement. If my
  response to the film seems lukewarm it is because it is. The
  directing by Hype Williams isn't that bad. He is able to capture
  some beautiful images and uses a few creative camera tricks. The
  lighting never seems quite right, but I'm gonna let that one
  slide. As a man who has always called for more sex and drugs in
  films I can hardly complain about their presence here. There
  people are living life to the fullest and are certainly not being
  weighed down by bourgeois conventions. All that said this film
  still fully deserves the big no vote that I am going to give it.
  As the most nihilistic person I know I am surprised to report
  that this one really seemed lost. Any image they could flash on
  the screen that would appeal to the wannabes in the audience was
  used. The N and F words are used to comedic proportions. Their
  palaces that represent their gluttony are turned into war zones
  and destroyed for no good reason. And then, on top of it all, we
  have to listen to the characters wax philosophical on how leading
  this life somehow places them on a higher plain than the rest of
  us. Sorry man, but just because you sell drugs instead of stocks
  doesn't make you any less slimy than those Wall Street hacks.
  You're still a businessman. This film is not worth watching. Any
  social point that is made is made accidentally, and any
  filmmaking skills the director may have are lost under his love
  fest for all things gangsta. **1/4</Text>
  <Text category="music">If you want the original recordings, don't
  purchase any volume of Television's Greatest Hits. I've had
  better luck recording the songs off of my TV with a cassette tape
  recorder and then dehissing them on my PC. These collections have
  sterile sounding fake stereo recordings of "The Beverly
  Hillbillies" and "The Munsters" that just don't sound right to
  me. If the original recordings don't matter to you, then you may
  like this CD</Text>
  <Text category="music">Get off the drugs, guys. Your reviews made me
  purchase this awful load of tripe. While proficient enough on the
  instruments and vocals, The Moon falls woefully short just about
  everywhere else. The songs sound very similar to one another and
  are all pretty much void of any decent melodies or even a good
  hook or two. Right when it seems they might be getting somewhere,
  they break the rhythm and make a feeble attempt to psych it up or
  out with a sitar, swirling strings or the ever constant and
  really abused minor key chord changes. There is also a curious
  lack of any decent choruses, here. I have to believe that that
  was a conscious effort on the part of The Moon. Bad idea, guys.
  And while the music is pretty lame, the lyrics are absolutely
  wretched. Can anyone out there, after listening to this, remember
  more than ten words from any song on this washed out CD? If you
  can, it's because they're so lame and uninspiring. The lyrics
  from The Temptations' "Psychadelic Shack" captures the feeling of
  the sixties better than anything these blotterheads came up with.
  Here's a big hint about the musical contents of this CD. It
  actually says on the front cover, "Featuring David Marks of The
  Beach Boys." Huh??? Is that supposed to be a ringing endorsement?
  Comparing these guys to Left Banke, The Zombies or The Beatles is
  pure blasphemy! For those of you fortunate enough to NOT have
  heard The Moon before, count your lucky stars. If you feel
  yourself slipping to the dark side (the boneheads giving this 4
  or 5 stars) and feel like spending some extra cash, there are
  other sixties groups more worthy of your money, like the
  aforementioned bands. I'm probably going to piss some people off
  with this review, but that's exactly how I felt after giving this
  CD a listen. Honestly, I immediately thought of George Harrison's
  less than stellar second rate efforts while listening to this. I
  love ya George, but you put out more than one clinker of a
  northern song. If bad Harrison's your thing......well, then stop
  reading and buy this CD now! For the rest of you, there's a lot
  of music from somewhat obscure sixties bands coming out on CD
  right now. Garage or psych, a lot of it is great, but the mine is
  also getting stipped pretty bare. The Moon is proof positive.
  It's also pretty easy to see why their recording company called
  it quits after two albums - and the second album is far superior
  to the first in both sound and content! In closing, while this
  album has overwhelming intracasies layered into the music and
  vocals, the end product is very bland. I read these guys admitted
  to cutting these songs while under the influence of LSD. It
  shows! I rated this "aural adventure" two stars, instead of one,
  for two reasons. First, I kept rooting for these guys to come up
  with a decent song to salvage the album (actually two). They
  never did, but at least they performed all original songs. It's
  also worth an added star to see a rerelease from a sixties band
  that doesn't have a cover of "Hey Joe" on it. If you're still
  with me (and also a lover of good music or even mediocre fare),
  avoid this CD like the plague! I'd also like to thank Amazon for
  putting this clinker on my recommendation lists. You done me
  wrong</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">The population of Hong Kong is approximately 7
  million people. I'd say that about half of them get shot in this
  movie. Usually when a movie runs over 2 hours, it's because
  there's a lot of plot that the director wanted to squeeze in. In
  the case of Hard Boiled, the running time of 126 minutes was
  clearly necessitated by John Woo's desire to get into the
  Guinness Book of Records for "most people killed by gunfire in a
  single motion picture." Chow Yun-Fat is a charismatic actor who
  can bring a wonderful balletic grace to gunplay, and this movie
  gives him plenty of opportunity to show his stuff. He shoots
  (usually with a pistol in each hand) while diving headlong over
  furniture, while swinging from a rope, while sliding down a
  banister(!), while being hurled through the air by explosions.
  Sometimes he even shoots while standing still. And he shoots, and
  shoots, and shoots. And the bad guys shoot, and shoot, and shoot.
  And Yun-Fat's fellow cops shoot, and shoot, and -- you get the
  idea. There are some fine action scenes in this film, but my eyes
  were glazing over long before it ended. There wasn't enough to
  distinguish one scene of a bunch of people being machine-gunned
  from the next, and it became painfully repetitious. Personally I
  would highly recommend The Replacement Killers over Hard Boiled.
  There's plenty of Yun-Fat's balletic shoot-em-up action, but not
  so much that you find yourself in the odd position of being
  lulled to sleep by gunfire</Text>
  <Text category="book">I bought the book after a practitioner used
  this technique on me. However, the information provided is too
  extensive and confusing, listing far too many "points" in the

  The body map listing them is in the first part of the book, so
  you have to flip back and forth to see what the author is
  referring to. I also thought some of the miraculous healing
  claims a little outrageous. The way this system originated is
  also a little murky. This is a better book for people training to

  <Text category="dvd">When we watched this remake of Brian's Song,
  it was not by design. We had requested the 1971 version from
  Netflix, but the DVD was damaged in the mail and they resent the
  2001 remake by mistake. But instead of sending it back again, we
  thought "what the hec, let's give it a chance." While we didn't
  expect it to live up to the beloved original, nothing could
  prepare us for how god-awful it was. So when we saw all the stars
  given to this remake, we were utterly mystified. Other than Mekhi
  Phifer's performance, which was pretty good, it was a joke.
  Sean's Maher's Brian Piccolo was a caricature; cartoony and
  over-the-top obnoxious. Maybe they had intended to cast Jim
  Carrey in the role but he was busy. Instead, they got Maher to do
  a Jim Carrey impersonation. James Caan portrayed Piccolo as this
  outgoing, wise-cracking guy, but he was human and believable --
  not a clown. And those football scenes. They looked ridiculous.
  At least in the original they used real game footage, which gave
  a real gritty sense of being in a stadium -- not at a high school
  or some sound stage. Even though the original was a TV movie, the
  performances, scenarios and dialog were well done, believable,
  touching, heartwrenching. If you watch it now is it dated? Of
  course, but there's nothing wrong with that. It is current to the
  time it depicts. But this remake reminds us of a very bad,
  melodramatic after-school special. Really, it was so bad I can't
  find adequate words to describe it</Text>

  <Text category="toys_games">We expose our babies/toddlers to a wide
  variety of cultural sources, in several languages. Therefore,
  having seen similar products it seemed logical to purchase this
  one, given it is touted as a multilingual introduction to their
  environment (our little ones are trilingual: English, Spanish and
  ASL, and they ignore us in all them!). Big mistake. The video not
  only reinforces but solidifies the sexist portrayal of love so
  prevalent in other Baby Einstein (BE) items. In earlier BE
  products one could see only female hands manipulating objects as
  they presented them on screen. Male hands were never present.
  This video goes many steps furhter by featuring male figures only
  in the background, or at best, an elderly man briefly interacting
  with a child. Everywhere else you see multiple females lovingly
  playing, caring or otherwise being nurturing to children. Males
  are only seen (with the exception of a black couple in bed while
  kids jump to play with them) in a distant background in entirely
  detached attitudes, or at least distant, dry and quiet poses,
  such as talking with a much older (male) child. It is as if they
  are shown there as part of the domestic landscape, however as
  movable and inane as potted plants, whom you can move and place
  at will. I felt insulted by this condescending and disqualifying
  view of male love and nurturing abilities. Asides, when you go
  into the Spanish version, it is (for a professionally produced
  video) riddled with mistakes. Three objects are mislabeled. In
  the first, when a cup - the plastic or paper tall type , not the
  coffee and saucer version, it is called "la taza", when in
  reality it should be "el vaso", as unlike English, where it is
  interchangeable "vaso" is the specific word for that item. The
  second - much worse instance, still in the kitchen was to
  introduce a bowl. There, the clueless scripter translated it as
  "el bol", a clear and poor corruption of the English word into a
  one commonly used in Spanglish, instead of calling it "tazo'n",
  as its correct name is. The last one I saw was in the yard (I'm
  suprised they didn't call it la yarda!: "Looka mami! get la troca
  and go a la marketa a buy a boncha de carrotas!"). This time they
  called an obvious swing (two ropes and a seat in between) "la
  hamaca", when in reality hamaca means hammock. Fortunately, we
  are native speakers amnd are abel to catch these pitfalls, but
  many people relies upon these products to teach their kids other
  languages. In sum I was discusted with the whole thing.</Text>

  the kind of acting you would find in a infomercial. For the
  superficial people out there I wouldn't watch this movie hoping

  <Text category="book">This is the latest in a never-ending series of
  books trying to generalize non-business world (eg. sports, armed
  forces, girl scouts, religion, NASA, etc.) management techniques
  to the business world. Most, possibly all, are of little value
  because of major differences. 1)Members constituting the varying
  organizations are motivated differently, and face greatly
  significantly different situations. What does eg. a fighter pilot
  or football coach have in common with a pharmicist, nurse,
  professor, financial analyst, etc.? I have no idea. 2)Key success
  factors vary from one business to another. For Merck, it may be
  speed of developing new drugs, getting through FDA approval, and
  motivating physicians to use them. For Nucor Steel, it
  undoubtedly rests much more on low-cost production. Again, what
  does either have to do with fighter pilots - little, if anything.
  One is better off reading books from similar situations - eg.

  <Text category="dvd">This is a bad movie not only because it
  doesn't fit chronologically in terms of feel and content. It's
  like this film attempts to create Turtles psychaitry 101. Each
  turtle attempts to work on and/or completely vanquish their
  weaknesses. Leo learns to be a better leader by being a better
  individual ninja, Mikey learns to be caring and heroic in
  addition to his usual humorous banter, Raphael learns to control
  his temper by doing peaceful things while befriending children,
  and I believe that Donny falls in love. It's been awhile since
  I've seen this film so I may have that last thing wrong. More
  than ten years have passed since I saw this stinker and although
  I don't remember every minute detail the problems that I had with
  it are enormous. First, the time travel plotline is a risky
  stretch for this series even though the conception of the turtles
  is vaguely sci-fi. The television series and films haven't really
  gleamed upon that aspect, instead relying on action, humor, and
  pseudo wisdom from Splinter to pass off a complete and perfect
  product. In my opinion the separate storylines of the Turtles is
  what ruines the movie and that is the result of the time travel
  plot. In particular, Leo's and Raphael's storylines simply drag
  the film down in an obvious way by placing them within contexts
  they should never be in. The pathos in these scenes is just too
  thick and is best in this series when it was dished out in
  moments. They just feel heavy handed. That's not to say Mikey's
  plotline isn't just as bad, but he's allowed to get away with
  some of it because the kids are pretty cute, but the scene with
  the house burning down is right out of a war movie and is not
  exhilarating at all. Secondly, the action is just not there as it
  was before. Sure, it's still pretty bloodless, but the scenes are
  few and far between and boring. The Turtles have been robbed of
  their seemingly invincible skills when they work together and the
  action has been in a more battlefield context so it loses a lot
  of it's previous effects of catharsis. It felt like I was
  watching the History Channel special about the history of the
  Turtles war in Japan and they lost. Also, the explosion at the
  end inside the bell was straight out of a Warner Brothers cartoon
  and not in character with the turtles. Having the bad guy killed
  off with the bomb would have been inappropriate too. I'm just the
  kind of guy who likes(in these kinds of movies) the bad guys to
  get a death that you don't have to see, or feel the impact of
  because you can't imagine when their end comes, like falling down
  a bottomless pit. To me, bombs are out of the question in terms
  of death. Thirdly, the humor suffers as much as the action
  because they have little opportunity to do it and when they do it
  feels forced and is not funny. An example would be a moment when
  two of the turtles are following, or running from bad guys and
  they're going up stairs, lots of stairs and Mikey goes, "This is
  good for my calfs," I was thinking, "What, is my mom supposed to
  laugh at that?" As for the Japanese men who take to American
  living all too well, none of it is very funny at all and
  reflecting on it now, it's like saying that just being drunk is
  funny as opposed to actually doing something funny when drunk,
  painfully unfunny and pointless. Equally as pointless was the use
  of Casey Jones. His character in the first movie almost steals
  the show at times, but in this movie he has nothing to do except
  watch over the Japanese men. In a way this is also doing to him
  what the film is doing to the turtles, forcing him to work on
  things that would be better worked out as moments not plotlines.
  In this story the writers would have Casey Jones completely
  emasculated, possibly for laughs, possibly for moral. The former
  is definitely not the case, the latter is underdeveloped. It's
  like he says early in film to the turtles asking where are more
  people to fight, that's what we're thinking for a majority of the
  film. In retrospect, the Japanese men might be a parallel for the
  turtles showing an example of what the writers probably think the
  turtles would be like if they were completely worthless. So he
  has the turtles learning powerful life lessons away from Splinter
  to show how meaningful and worthy they are to detractors of the
  series. I admit, it's a good idea but way too heavy handed. The
  meaning is always better in small doses. FINALLY, the song used
  in the film toward the end with the Japanese men in the bar is
  such a good song and is very exciting. It was used to great
  effect in the TV spots for the film to make the audience believe
  going into the theatre that it was going to an exciting, funny,
  action-adventure and instead they gave us this stale role
  reversal film that tarnishes the turtles legacy and insured that
  there would never be another turtles film. Oh well, at least
  found out the name of that song</Text>

  Whatever it is, please consider passing it along, because other

  <Text category="dvd">I had several friends INSIST that I rent this
  film. I'm glad I did instead of buying it. I was not bowled over
  as they obviously were - quoting lines from it and all but
  wetting themselves remembering scenes from the film. Now, I'm not
  a hard guy to make laugh, but there was only one point in this
  film where I actually laughed out loud. Other than that, I found
  Sordid Lives to be just tediously amateurish and more than a bit
  forced. I love Southern humor and even poking fun at Southerners:
  I can't tell you how much I love Greater Tuna, Fried Green
  Tomatos, Steel Magnolias, etc. but this just didn't cut it for
  me. The cast is a who's who of excellent character actors: Beau
  Bridges, Bonnie Bedelia, Leslie Jordan, Olivia Newton-John (for
  pete's sake!), Erik Krieger, Delta Burke and gobs of others. No,
  it's not a shortage of talent that this film lacks. I found that
  it was a lack of a cohesive direction that made me wince more
  than once. There's a scene with Ty (an out of the closet to
  everyone but his parents young man who lives in West Hollywood)
  talking to his ex-girlfriend in the reception area of their
  therapist...well, as a theatre director, I can only tell you that
  the performances during this one scene are so painfully badly
  acted and the pregnant pauses between the lines are so large you
  could drive fleets of trucks through them. There are various
  filming techniques that Del Shores (the director) uses that are
  just hackneyed: filming from behind a person's back so that only
  the back of one person's head and the facing person are seen.
  Why? It feels like a testimonial "video" from MTV's Real World
  rather than an actual film. Frankly - and this is not always a
  bad thing - the whole film felt like it was a play converted to
  film. It can be a great thing! Look at Altmans' Come Back to the
  Five and Dime Jimmy Dean and you'll see how a good stage to film
  movie is done. But this...well, it's just amateur hour from my
  perspective. In all, the film felt like a poor man's Greater Tuna
  (two quick change artists playing 16 characters living in Texas'
  3rd smallest town), which WAS a stage play and WAS filmed for HBO
  as a stage play rather than attempting to make it FEEL like a

  drift inexorably towards artistic middle-age and the lure of MOR

  might have expected some innovation and sharpness in the settings
  he chooses. Sadly,the evidence on this release is of an artist
  who's content to mine the same musical territory for about 15
  years now to the point of exhaustion; theres nothing here he
  hasn't said better on his previous three or four outings. All is
  not lost though, and there are moments of stark beauty here and

  suited to a film soundtrack or TV documentary about some

  aware of what my daughter is reading, but this time this
  particular book slipped under my radar. She told me that it had a
  reference to a gay character, which I took to mean just a passing
  reference, but when I read the book, it was treated more
  seriously than I thought, even going so far as to have the two
  girls kiss. It is inexcusable, both on Ms Pierce's part and on
  Scholastic's. No matter what the author's personal beliefs, it is
  irresponsible to have this type of content without a warning to

  <Text category="toys_games">I bought these for my 13-year old niece, who

  They looked like a great buy. Well, the disappointment was
  palpable two hours later. We got them hooked up, installed
  appropriate batteries etc., and the light was on, but we could
  not get any sound from the drumsticks at all. Which was a bummer,
  but OK, if we could simply either (1) get help or (2) easily
  replace them. Nope. The "instructions" were a tiny folded sheet
  of paper, there is absolutely no troubleshooting, no help, no
  nothing. I went through everything that came with them but could
  find anything to help us on next steps or returns, etc. I finally
  retrieved the original plastic packaging and found a URL in tiny
  letters for the company. But when I went there, the site again
  offered no help, tips, or troubleshooting (just a PDF of the
  really awful original instructions). There is video on the
  website showing someone playing the drumsticks but this was no
  help to us in trying to troubleshoot (except to mildly disappoint
  my niece when she realized that you have to drum "in the air" to
  get the best results -- which we did try, with no luck or sound,
  again). I next e-mailed the company and got no response. I
  e-mailed them again and -- seven days later -- the e-mail (in
  badly worded English) simply asked me if we had tried "plugging
  in the head phones." Seriously. Anyway, do NOT waste your money.

  you reach into the middle to change the picture disk. 2) the
  light is not very bright and will not work in mid-day light. 3)
  the image is quite small - only takes up the middle 3 inches of
  the paper - not even close to what is pictured on the box. 4) the
  clamps that hold the paper are not easy for tiny fingers to use.
  5) because the small picture is in the middle of the page and the
  clamps are on the far edges, you can't shift the paper to re-use
  the paper. You get one tiny picture in the middle of standard
  size piece of paper and its a waste. The chalk board was fine -

  <Text category="toys_games">PROS: Very cool toy/model for a 12+ with extra
  time on their hands. CONS: Too many microscopic pieces to count.
  Very little room for open play. Requires extreme caution playing
  with it because the propeller and other pieces fall apart at the
  slightest breath. Not appropriate for under 7, at least. First
  just let me say that my son loves the Lego Duplo blocks and
  spends hours creating all kinds of different designs with them.
  He has been begging for the "big boy" Legos, and I have been
  turning him down, pointing out the recommended ages on the box,
  (knowing that I would be picking up infinite numbers of tiny
  pieces throughout the house for the next 18+ years). The ages
  they put on the box seem to be purely arbitrary, based on this
  particular toy. A well-meaning relative decided to bless him with
  this present on his 5th birthday. (I will be seeking revenge as
  soon as they have children.) I spent the next several hours
  constructing this nightmare, which in and of itself defeats the
  purpose of a building toy, in my opinion. I have no idea where
  they have the idea that this is appropriate for a 5-year-old,
  given that it was a challenge for me to put this together. Given
  the amount of microscopic pieces in this toy, one has to wonder
  who designs these things and if they have children of their own.
  So much of it seems purely sadistic. When the helicopter was
  finally assembled (and I warned him that that was the one and
  only time I was putting it together), my son spent some time
  playing with it, only to be constantly frustrated by the fact
  that pieces were constantly popping off, particularly the
  propeller, and this was with very gentle play. Bottom line, if
  you have a child under 10, they would probably have many more
  hours of play if you just bought a lot of inexpensively priced
  Lego blocks (of various types) that they could make into all
  kinds of different designs. These expensively priced City lines
  and the like are really neat once built, but then it's just like
  a very fragile model. Once you've spent the time constructing it,
  you really don't want to take it apart, so I'm not really sure
  why you would buy this over a traditional model. I guess I miss
  the point.</Text>

  Great, now there's a pan, a knife and a cutting board to wash! It

  It's not hardcore, it's not really melodic....it's sort of stuck
  in the middle of both but not quite reaching either one. Maybe
  I'm not the target audience for emo or this band....I get that,
  that's ok. I can't stop thinking Thursday seem like they're
  trying desperately to sound like Fugazi and never really getting
  there. And that's the rub of it I guess....with bands like
  Thursday and She Wants Revenge...they appear to be reaching for
  the roots of alternative/hardcore or newwave music but for
  someone who knows what the real thing sounds like, they're a poor
  imitation. The sound is immature and lacks the urgency and edge
  that the original bands had at the time. I have a friend with a
  14 year old son who asked me to burn him a copy of this CD. I
  think I'll just be giving it to him and calling it done</Text>
  <Text category="book">I admittedly have not completed the full book,
  as it is thick. However I do find that the narrative focuses on
  the reactive rather than the proactive tools needed for DFSS. For
  example almost all the examples given in section 2 talk about an
  existing system or process and there doesn't seem to be any
  design examples and how the stats are used to solve the design
  problems. I therefore think the book is more about Six Sigma than
  DFSS. Barry</Text>
  <Text category="health">I saw a commercial, I read a reviews - and so
  I bough one box at Walmart. It's not worth it, that's my
  conclusion. The trays are made of very thin plastic-like
  material, and are very difficult to position properly on your
  teeth. The active gel easy goes out of trays, and fills your
  mouth. During first couple od uses, after 20 min or so I started
  to feel a vague pain in my gum. Nevertheless, I continued using
  the product for all 7 days, as advertised, 30 min a day. After
  the whole package was gone, the change of color of my teeth is
  barely visible. I hope you will have better luck.</Text>

  <Text category="health">I took a chance (it's pricey) and purchased
  this item. &amp;amp;quot;What the heck,&amp;amp;quot; I thought.
  I used it (a single 'squirt') once a day in the morning. This was

  My skin felt lubricated and smooth without feeling greasy. In

  <Text category="dvd">Firstly I must say how much I dislike Jennifer
  Lopez so attempting to watch this movie has been a struggle since
  it was first released however I decided to brave it out for the
  sake of Ralph Fiennes. Lopez plays a maid who falls for a guy who
  has loads of money (Fiennes, who is miscast, really) He thinks
  she is a guest in the hotel, she plays along. So she lies about
  herself for the rest of the movie and when all is revealed, it
  comes to a ridiculous ending. There's not much else to say to
  this cinderella movie, except maybe that it's not funny. Lopez
  isn't a great actress, she and Fienness have about as much
  chemistry as a toothbrush in a toiletbowl</Text>

  <Text category="music">"Maiden Voyage" appears on innumerable lists
  of jazz masterpieces, and it is clear from the first listen that
  both the composition and the playing are at a level of technical
  proficiency unmatched on most albums of this era or any time
  afterward. Nevertheless, the finished product is not one that all
  listeners will find appealing. To these ears, this album seems
  aimless and even somewhat annoying. The songs meander without
  clear structure and Tony Williams' drumming seems at times to be
  going in a direction opposite that of the rest of the band. The
  influence of this album is indisputable, but its enjoyability is
  a more subjective matter. If you enjoy groundbreaking, cerebral
  jazz such as the music made by Miles Davis' second quintet, then
  this album will probably work for you. If, on the other hand, you
  favor Hancock's earlier and more accessible albums "Takin' Off"
  and "My Point of View," this album may be a bit of a
  letdown</Text>
  <Text category="book">I personally do not see how this book could
  have won a Newbery medal. While the author portrays sibling
  rivalry effectively, that is about the only positive aspect of
  this book. The fact that the teenage girl protagonist has a crush
  on an elderly man is disgusting and is presented as not only
  being acceptable but understandable. Sara's family is also
  unsupportive to her sulky and jealous attitudes. Her grandmother
  is a busybody and consantly antagonizes the family. Sara's twin
  sister gets all the attention and love, leaving Sara starving for
  parental care. Finally, Christianity is portrayed as harsh and
  judgemental. This book could possibly be acceptable for adults
  but never for children and I would not recommend it to anyone. I
  wasted my time with this book: please don't waste yours.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This movie was quite honestly one of the worst
  movies I have ever seen. As a huge Colin Firth fan originally
  from a small town in Vermont, I thought that no matter what I had
  heard about the film I would enjoy it. Unfortunately, I was
  wrong. The main problem of the film was characterization. There
  were oftentimes no motivations or explanations whatsoever for the
  character's actions. One minute, the small town girl played by
  Heather Graham is working at a nursing home, then she's downing
  alcohol, then she's jumping around naked for absolutely no
  apparent reason (in fact, she doesn't even seem drunk), and all
  this entices the character Colin Firth to jump into bed with her.
  I think the Heather Graham character is supposed to be quirky,
  but because of the script and the way the film is cut, she comes
  off as schitsophrenic and unlikable. Then suddenly they are in a
  serious relationship which Colin dives into wholeheartedly even
  though he is supposed to be recovering from a breakup with his
  fiance (and this is no rebound relationship). Basically, the
  movie continues along this vein, with Minnie Driver showing up as
  the dark-haired British ex-fiance who you can't see ever having
  had a relationship with Colin (both actors are better in the much
  superior movie Circle of Friends). In any case, there are many
  more unexplained actions and wierd breakups/get back togethers
  before the movie thankfully ends. Additionally, the setting is
  completely misused, beginning with the sign that says more than
  18,000 people live in Hope. In New England, that does not
  classify as a small town. They could have used the autumn setting
  and American-ness of the people as restorative to the Colin
  character. The suggestion of that is there, but it is never
  demonstrated - instead, they go to a spot that is supposed to be
  nice and the Heather Graham character downs a bottle of booze,
  and Colin Firth's character has no real explanation or feeling in
  his portraits of the town's people. Although the hotel owners are
  fun, if unrealistic, the mayor has been written as if he were a
  cartoon character. Finally, I don't neccessarily blame the actors
  for this awful movie, with the wierd cutting, it may have seemed
  like a good idea at the time. I think Colin Firth does his best
  at being an ambigious, but still likeable guy. Heather Graham,
  aside from not coming off as a small town girl at all, has
  absolutely nothing to work with, so you can't even blame her for
  the horrendous character she has. And everyone else, including
  Minnie Driver, is a complete caricature, although Minnie Driver
  incites some of the few amusing moments in the film. I feel bad
  to judge this movie so harshly, but it is unneccessarily bad, and
  I had been hoping for something at least fun. These actors all
  have much better movies out there.</Text>

  "Smiling Laughing Joking Around Man" ... "Man Who Reminds Me Of

  skit in all of SNL history would be on there, but no...it was
  just a 20 second clip. I was SO disappointed!! And it was quite
  surprising to see some of the skits they chose to show in their
  entirety...They just weren't funny. On a positive note, there was
  a serious song and dance number at the very end of the DVD that
  was so sweet, it brought me to tears. And the bonus featuring

  <Text category="book">I have studied the tarot for nearly 5 years
  and keep an open mind whenever a new book appears on the market.
  Edain McCoy, who has written some wonderful New Age material,
  strikes an off-putting note in this one. The spreads are
  certainly imaginative and are perhaps insightful to her own
  method of tarot interpretation, but convey confusing and
  ambiguous directions to the reader who is trying to understand
  her card placements. In several of her spreads she conveys that a
  card's placement at a certain point in the spread "may or may
  not" mean some karmic element at play. The whole exercise of
  creating a spread is to pinpoint with a degree of accuracy the
  situation you wish to define. Therefore, when a card "may or may
  not" mean something, that interpretation could significantly
  change on whether you "may or may not" interpret it that way,
  leaving the interpreter open to rationalizing a card's meaning.
  Tarot cards are intuitive, not rational, and their meanings can
  best be intuited when their placement is clearly defined without
  ambiguity It is difficult to have it both ways and I found
  working with these spreads difficult. Imagine doing a Celtic
  Cross reading and the first position "may or may not" be the root
  of the issue. These spreads speak very clearly to the author, but
  not so to the reader. I rate it 2 stars for depth and insight
  into Karma and past lives, but the explanations are too
  ambiguous.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Well, at least the movie is faithful to its
  source in its spirit. Based on a book written on 1902, it's
  nostalgia of the British empire belongs to that era. The plot
  deals with a soldier who is expelled from his regiment for
  refusing to go to fight a colonial war in Sudan because of his
  impending marriage. Not only his colleagues regard him now as a
  coward, but also his future wife. He had no choice then but to go
  to war to prove he is a real man and not a coward. The filmmakers
  try nothing in terms to bring the material up to date, to our
  more contemporary (and one hopes, more enlightened) attitudes.
  There's no post colonial guilt here whatsoever. In some ways,
  this speaks well of the filmmakers in terms of not trying to
  tamper with the original material; in another way, it is a bit
  shocking seeing such jingoism in a contemporary movie. All of
  this wouldn't matter much if the movie was entertaining;
  unfortunately, it is only intermittently so</Text>
  <Text category="music">"Incredible" I saw one review describing this
  production. The meaning of the word must have been changed in the

  <Text category="book">I'm trying to figure out what the appropriate
  subtitle for this book should be and I can't decide among the
  following: * Travels Through Guilt with the World's 33rd Richest
  Hippie * The Mind of an Empty Suit * A Self-Important Revisionist
  History * How I Learned to Hate Myself and Love the Third World *
  Memoirs of a Cold War Paperpusher Confessions of an Economic
  Hitman by John Perkins is an exclamation point riddled history of
  a few financial manipulations of the Cold War by a man who had no
  stake in his own ambition. The first thing you notice about this
  account is that it is written by a man who thinks he was sitting
  on top of the world, when in fact he was just a cog in the energy
  industry. If you are credulous enough to believe that the debts
  and revenues associated with the energy business is indeed the
  core principle of the global economy, then the moral outrage of
  this book makes sense. But there's a whole lot to swallow. On the
  plus side, it's a fast and somewhat entertaining read. Otherwise
  it is a exercise in the slow revelations of a kind of
  self-loathing that takes about 20 years to surface. One of the
  things that I've had in mind as I was reading this screed was the
  sense of geography as destiny. As I look at the 20th Century, I
  think of most of it focused on the economics of . Perkins was one
  of the people who made the truth a narrative of economic
  exploitation. He falls in love with Socialist charismatics in
  Latin America, rues the lives of poor peasants, and bemoans the
  basic nature of corporate capitalism without ever acknowledging
  or even understanding the basic nature of socialism. Perkins is a
  perfect example of a cultural relativist. a perceptive reader can
  see how much he hates his hometown and parents and idolizes
  romantic ideals associated with revolutionary rhetoric. But you
  can't imagine that he even had the temerity to read Marx, Weber,
  Engles, Friere or anyone. Back when I was a bit more blackified,
  I referred to such people as culture vultures. If it's
  indigenous, it's good. But you'll never see him once talk about
  infant mortality statistics, literacy rates, crime rates or even
  inflation. I discovered a bit too late that this book would teach
  me nothing about the business of foreign direct investment or the
  workings of the World Bank except that he saw it as evil.
  Technically, you'll get a great deal more insight reading
  Wikipedia. Basically, Perkins assumes that his game was the only
  game on the planet, his company was smack dab in the middle of it
  and that it was all being subtley directed by the CIA and NSA and
  that this is, was and always will be the American way. You really
  get a foggy view of the Evil Empire of America from Perkins, who
  resembles nobody quite so much as a cynical wanker who is too
  soulless to quit the game. It's a confession all right. By the
  time I got 2/3rds of the way through, reading the book began to
  become annoying. The incredible vacuity of this man was
  staggering. There are no personal relationships in the book worth
  speaking of. He found loyalty only to his bosses worth
  mentioning. It is a stunning revelation about his character that
  he never once had a kind word to say or any personal quality
  worth mentioning about his staff that stands out in memory. We
  learn that he took one of his charges (female) on a yacht cruise
  to some isle in the Caribbean, but that when he got there, he was
  so sickened by his guilty conscience that he banged his head
  against the coconut trees. If you want to understand something
  about the life of an economist and high finance, the best book
  I've read is My Life as a Quant. If you want to understand
  something about the life of a reluctant spy, the best book to
  read is Larry Kolb's Overworld. If you want to get well-written
  account of a man who was too spoiled to find himself while being
  a toady in the economic hardball of the Cold War era, then this
  is your book. But it's nowhere near as good as, say The Quiet
  American. You can imagine that Perkins, who is a great admirer of
  Graham Greene, might have had aspirations to be such a character
  as Greene might pen. He is earnest to tell such a story that
  would portray himself thus, but he is to honest to consider
  himself heroic, and I suspect that he'll be working off his guilt
  for the rest of his life. In that regard, 'Confessions of an
  Economic Hitman' is (now prefaced and extended in the paperback
  edition) a blueprint for American liberal guilt. If there was
  ever someone who truly believed that global warming and a host of
  other blowbacks are destined to doom America to a well-deserved
  kharmic smackdown, it is John Perkins. He has always been a
  citizen of the world pretending to be a patriotic American, down
  to the repetitions of his undying faith in the words of Thomas
  Paine. You'd think, being a pseudo-economist, that he'd have some
  room in his heart for Alexander Hamilton. Ahh but that would mean
  that he'd have to admire courage. I didn't want to be a harsh
  judge of Perkins. I thought I might learn of an extraordinary
  life, one of conviction and then epiphany. Instead I learned of a
  small yapping dog who was always on a leash he lacked the spirit
  to gnaw through. Someone who would tell us in the end that we
  should use less oil and that 'corporatocray' is evil. This book
  has been a disappointment in many ways. I may well be very happy
  to read Thomas Friedman after this. Good parts? Yeah there are a
  few. He speaks about a few South American presidents who might
  have been contenders. He gives a few details about Saudi Aramco.
  But compared to Larry Kolb's fascinating and detailed portraits
  of Daniel Ortega and Adnan Khashoggi, this is Romper Room. If
  Perkins thought he was an agent... don't make me laugh</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">The Quiet Earth is overrated for a variety of
  reasons that will be discussed below. This movie is not the epic,
  thought-provoking, intelligent sci fi I was led to believe it
  was. It's actually very overrated, and fans of intelligent sci fi
  such as 2001 or Primer will likely be very disappointed. The
  first 30 minutes or so are jaw-dropping. I was really getting
  geared up for what I was sure was going to become one of my
  all-time favorites. The scenes of Bruno standing above the
  wrecked passenger jet, driving around a mall, the sun rising to
  the haunting score--all unforgettable. The scenes where Bruno
  starts to lose it, running around in a slip brandishing a
  shotgun, setting up cardboard figures of celebrities and
  pretending he's their ruler, giving them speeches (That's why I
  deserve to be President...of the quiet earth...I've been
  condemned to live) are all great. After this point the movie
  starts to disintegrate, and quickly. The female character is
  highly irritating, so much so that I think I would have ditched
  her and looked for other survivors. Api is also highly
  irritating, and when the film veers away from its central mystery
  and starts devolving into yet another film about a petty love
  triangle--my thumbs were pointing down, way down. Something needs
  to be said about the ending of this film. So many people have
  said that it's "deep." How is it "deep?" How is it deep when it's
  just a gimmicky way to quickly wrap a rather dodgy film that
  really doesn't have anything to say? Let's examine this. Many
  people argue the following (and if they were correct the film
  would've been much better than it was): The main character is a
  scientist who convinces himself that Project Flashlight resulted
  in "the effect" (even though others here insist on calling it
  "the event") which made everyone else disappear. The main
  characters come to believe that "the effect" didn't snatch them
  up too because they were died right when it happened. But what if
  there isn't any "effect" at all? What if these are just three
  people who died and then went to another earth where there aren't
  any people? The scientist then convinces himself that "the
  effect" is going to happen again, and, understandably fed up with
  the fact that the only other two people on earth are a bonkers,
  daffy, annoying woman and a nutty, homicidal maniac, decides to
  basically kill himself while blowing up the satellite for Project
  Flashlight. He dies again and ends up on another world, one which
  this time doesn't even resemble earth. The end. It would have
  been very clever if this was what was going on, if there really
  wasn't an "effect" at all and if the three protagonists had just
  happened to go to the same place when they died. Unfortunately,
  all the critics saying "they went to another earth where everyone
  else was gone" are forgetting something: the dead bodies! I know
  there aren't a lot, but remember, there's the radiation burn guy
  in the science station, and there's the dead guy on the hood of
  his car, and the dead woman holding a CB radio, etc. If they went
  to another earth where life was absent, why are there dead
  people? The real answer is that this movie was not very well
  thought out, that it doesn't make sense, and that the ending is
  just a cheap and easy way to try and appear impressive. According
  to the people who worked on the film, "the effect" obviously did
  occur, and what happens at the end is that when the scientist
  tries to kill himself a second time he dies, again, at the exact
  moment that "the effect" occurs a second time. So at the end,
  "the effect" does occur a second time, which means the girl and
  Api are history, and the scientist, as he again dies when "the
  effect" occurs, moves on one more time. Another point that is
  made in the DVD commentary is that the film was made by a
  Catholic, so the obvious purgatory then heaven tripe comes to
  mind. Also highly irritating is that for a scientist, the main
  character is not very smart. He laments that he's the last person
  on earth and then he runs into a nutty woman. They find a nutty
  guy named Api and then the three of them conclude they're the
  last three people on earth! What?! Are they totally daft? A
  scientist would quickly reason that if there were three people
  within such a small region of the same city then there are
  probably other people in the city, more people than that
  throughout the rest of New Zealand, and even more people in
  bigger places such as America, Europe, and Asia. That his first
  conclusion is always that "they're the only ones" only
  demonstrates his stupidity. They come to believe that they all
  died at the same time, right when "the effect" occurred, and that
  that's why they remained on earth. Well, if three people died at
  the exact same time in the same city in tiny New Zealand, then
  many, many other people must've died at that time throughout the
  rest of the massive world.</Text>
  <Text category="book">I was really looking forward to reading "Ever
  After" when I saw the favorable quote on the back cover by Larry
  Gelbart. But the book turned out to be a VERY cursory glance at
  the past 25 years of musical theater with remarkably little
  insight. Here are the three things I learned from this book: (1)
  Mega-musicals are almost always artistically corrupt; (2) Andrew
  Lloyd Webber is the anti-Christ; (3) The only innovative musicals
  to arrive in the past 25 years started Off-Broadway (mostly at
  Playwrights Horizons and Lincoln Center). Most of the hundreds of
  shows mentioned in this book get one paragraph each, with very
  few illuminating details. Here's what the author says about
  "Carrie," perhaps the most famous recent Broadway musical flop:
  "Carrie, of course, was an instant classic, a monument in the
  pantheon of failed Broadway musicals. Adapated by Michael Gore
  (music) and Don Pitchford (lyrics) from the notorious Stephen
  King novel (and even more notorious film), this $7 million
  musical celebration of prom vengeance and bad taste materialized
  at the Virginia Theater on the 12th of May, 1988 and was gone by
  the 15th, touching all who saw it with a timeless reverence for
  its indelible, monumental ineptitude." Does that really tell us
  very much about this musical? Did Barry Singer even see the show?
  You sure wouldn't know it from this description. And just what, I
  wonder, makes King's novel "notorious" or the movie "even more
  notorious"? Almost every show in this book rates that brief a
  mention, but somehow Singer finds time for an entire chapter of
  Lloyd Webber-bashing where Sir Andrew invites the author to a
  cocktail party to show off his newest female singing discovery.
  The chapter sticks out like a sore thumb, if only because it has
  nothing to do with the rest of the book, but also because it's
  one of the few times that Singer goes into any detail. Aside from
  a few interesting Sondheim quotes, this book is a waste of
  time.</Text>

  Mom for Christmas. We decided to play the 2 player game thinking
  it would be fun. Well, the word my Mother used to describe it is
  "EXCRUCIATING". This was the slowest and most boring thing I've
  ever played. There is at least a 10 second pause between EACH
  function (choosing a case, opening the case, Howie giving you
  directions, taking turns, looking at your opened case. . .you
  name it). Each time you switch back to the other player, THE
  SCREEN LITERALLY GOES BLACK! You only see the suitcase girls in
  the beginning and the end. When a case is opened, you only see
  two arms, breasts and the case! When it is your turn to pick a
  case, there is COMPLETE SILENCE as you scroll - and I use the

  which you assume to move quickly, you'd better set aside at lease
  an hour to play it. You will be exhausted when you're through. We

  <Text category="music">Understand, I love Springsteen. Born to Run is
  my second favorite album of all time. I have seen him live over a
  dozen times. I personally think he is the single most important
  American rock and roll artist ever (with apologies to Elvis,
  Chuck Berry and Dylan). I even loved Nebraska, so don't tell me
  it's an E-Street band thing or a rock versus folk thing, but this
  album is unlistenable. Some reviewers have called it beautiful
  and powerful. That's rubbish. There is a complete absence of
  melody on this record, as was the case with much of The Ghost of
  Tom Joad album (with a huge exception being "Youngstown" - a
  great song). The apparently willful attempt to alter his singing
  style to sound like Woody Guthrie or Jimmy Rodgers is just
  frightening. Dylan could pull it off, Bruce just disappoints. But
  it's the songs and lack of anything remotely resembling melody
  that makes this record a failure. Believe, I listened to Devil
  &amp;amp; Dust 10-15 times in hopes of finding what I am
  apparently missing. I couldn't. I thought The Rising was a nice

  <Text category="toys_games">I ordered this doll for my 3 year old
  grandaughter who wanted nothing else for Christmas and even
  though the stores were sold out, she was sure that Santa could
  get it for her. When my daughter called to make SURE that I had
  it actually in hand - I said SURE - I ordered it from Amazon!
  After all, the description said that was the SWIMMING
  Mermaid...that it would swim as soon as you put it in the water.
  IT IS NOT!!!! Like the other lady said - it is Just another
  Barbie doll in a green dress. Now I will have to pay a premium to
  get it from Ebay (where I could have gotten it for less a week
  ago) and also have to pay express shipping and hope it gets here
  before Christmas. I will have pay 6 times what I paid for this
  deception and hope that Santa can get it here in time so that my
  grandaughter is not disappointed. Beware of this seller! I see

  <Text category="music">Here's my theory in regards to how one should
  rate a remix album: If a song is remixed, then that remix should
  be better than the original song. Otherwise, what's the point?
  With that being said, Nu-Mixx Klazzics is pretty much pointless.
  This is nothing more than a cash in album. The people at Death
  Row/Koch know that folks will continue to buy Pac's music as long
  as you can manage to put a new spin on it (especially the die
  hards...they'll buy anything associated with the man). Well, the
  spin they put on this particular album is just plain terrible. If
  you have the source material, stick with that. These "remixes"
  don't make the originals better, they actually make them worse.
  The beats sound like throw away beats from an old JT Tha Bigga
  Figga album and some of the lyrics have been altered/changed so
  that they sound updated (removing Snoop from "2 of Amerikka's
  Most..." and distorting Pac's vocals when he says his name is
  just terrible), but these changes are only for the worst. In
  short, all aspects of this album are sorry. The guests are wack
  and the beats are generic, hollow, "clubby" beats. Remember
  y'all, when these albums were dropped back in '96 the beats had
  more meat to them. There is one decent track though. "Life Goes
  On" gets a different look and I'm not so sure that it's all that
  bad. I find it tolerable, but I could see why why someone
  wouldn't like it. But this is coming from someone that wasn't all
  that crazy about the original because I wasn't feeling the beat.
  If you enjoyed the original, then stick with that. Also, I like
  that the original version of "Hit 'Em Up" was used here. In this
  version, 'Pac can be heard giving props to east coast emcees that
  he was cool with (thus proving that he wasn't anti - east coast,
  just anti - Bad Boy). Whoever gave the green light to have this
  released should be fired. It's a shame that folks are pimping
  Tupac's music like this. But they'll continue to do it as long as
  folks continue to buy it. I'm drawing the line here. Shame on
  you, Suge. Your label isn't relevant anymore, get over it and
  move on. Standout Tracks: Don't even waste your time looking for

  <Text category="dvd">The whole point of this ghost story, is like
  in the orinigal, a surprise, twisted ending. Yet, once again, in
  a 90's Hollywood horror flick, it is dissappointing. The actors
  within the movie are actually pointless and show no effect,but,
  there not to blame. The blame is the poor script writing for this
  movie. The movie has you going until about half way through, when
  they introduce the ghost to you. Now, unlike any other ghost in
  Hollywood history, this ghost is literally a black blob. It
  contains some invisible bodies and haunts people with its face,
  which in turn, reveals the face of whom it kills. But, literally,
  when you put a 100 foot ghost into a movie, you better make sure
  its in the right one. This movie should probably been called The
  Blob, not House on Haunted Hill. It is a horrible re-make and a
  waste of about 2 hours. Please, for your own sake, rent some good
  genre horror, like Halloween or When a Stranger Calls. Not some
  crappy remake that wants to make you leave the room your watching
  it in. Better luck next time to the director, producer, co-
  producer, and writer of this film, because of all the people that
  took part, probably just wanted to make some cheap money, so they
  made a movie. Better luck next time</Text>

  <Text category="music">Neither the Amazon review or any of the
  customer reviews recently submitted mention this fact. I have few
  classical and pop recordings in mono that do not impact the
  listening experience such as 'Songs for Swinging Lovers' - Frank
  Sinatra or Beethoven's Opera Fidelio - conductor Otto Klemperer
  (Testament Label). The material on these recordings are so good
  that the listener completely ignores the fact that they are mono
  recordings. I did not hear anything outstanding on this CD to
  make me overlook the 'mono' factor. Is this some great jazz
  masterpiece, recorded live in Carnegie Hall by two giants of
  Jazz? I personally don't think so. Somehow this material remained
  in obscurity for all this time and somebody by accident
  discovered this gem - if you believe that then Elvis is alive and
  the earth is exactly 6000 years old. With small jazz bands, I
  like to listen to the musicians communicate with each other
  within the context of a thesis. Examples: 'Sunday at the Village
  Vanguard - Bill Evans Trio' or 'New York Reunion - McCoy Tyner
  Quartet'. I wanted to but could not hear anything of this sort in
  this recording. This material is more likely to be understood
  only by the performers themselves and the real jazz aficionados.
  It may have been hasty but after one listen I decided to sell
  this CD and I have no regrets other than buying it in the first
  place.</Text>

  self-indulgent tripe, and if you ask me, this album belongs in

  <Text category="music">This is What you want (1983) was a terrible
  album from John Lydon and Martin Atkins. After an rift between
  Keith Levene and John Lydon occured during the recording of the
  demo tracks, Atkins and Lydon ran Keith off and he quit the band.
  Instead of keeping him on the finished tracks, Atkins and Lydon
  removed Levene and Pete Jones (the band's studio bassist) from
  the audio tracks and re-recorded them with members from their
  Holiday Inn band (Lydon hired members from a covers band who
  performed at a New Jersey Holiday Inn). The new tracks and
  horrible. All of the guitar riffs and rhythm section that were
  originally recorded for the future album were erased. Noise and
  other unwelcomed sounds were added to the tracks. The original
  tracks were far superior (even in their basic state) to what was
  released. To hear them you'll have to find the Commercial Zone
  LP. The failure of this disc and the bickering between Atkins and
  Lydon would cause the band to become a solo project for the
  former anarchy king. Not recommended</Text>

  <Text category="music">Clipped, petite and looking more like a
  leather bar Anne Murray, Crow drags out the hits and the
  `friends' for this all-star live bash. Half the album is standard
  issue and straight ahead stage sweat with the morning beer-buzz
  afficiando going it alone without a little help from her friends
  (All I Wanna Do, Everyday Is a Winding Road, A Change Would Do
  You Good, Leaving Las Vegas). With only slight variations on
  these overplayed originals (a sychopantic crowd and some
  tinkering with the rhythms) Crow's solo chores rarely rate more
  than a grudging ho-hum. The rest of the album is a parade of
  snap-on tools (Dixie Chicks, Stevie Nicks, Eric Clapton, Sarah
  McLachlan, Chrissie Hynde) who easily steal the spotlight from
  their downhome hash-slinging waitress/host. Reduced to the role
  of supporting guitarist, Crow butters the toast from the
  sidelines as femme contemporaries like Nicks (who unravels
  admirably on Gold Dust Woman), Hynde and McLachlan flounder about
  the mike in a haphazard hit (Hynde's If It Makes You
  Happy)-and-miss (McLachlan's The Difficult Kind) headbutt at
  Crow's hits. But it isn't until Clapton's suspendered,
  cigar-chomping husk is rolled out to update Cream's White Room
  that the sour stench of monstrous micalculation reaches it's
  devastating climax. Fresh from watering the daisies and still in
  his jammies, Clapton's return to the electric psychedelics of his
  Paleolithic past is a fumbling bumbling fiasco unleashed with the
  grace and finesse of a diarrhetic Brontosaurus. It's horrifying
  to think that this is what Cream would have sounded like if they
  hadn't broken up. Thank God for egos. It's almost a relief to
  hear Richards mindlessly croak his way through the old Stones
  Exile-era toss-off Happy, as if a cadaverous ex-junkie with the
  durability of a cockroach and nine lives would be anything but.
  Besides, Richards provides wonderful comic relief and criticizing
  his artistic capacity is as futile as pointing out the flaws in
  the bandages on an Egyptian mummy. The wrapper finds the entire
  gang, from Spanky Nicks to Buckwheat Clapton, joining hands for a
  bizarre entreaty with a kindergarten rendition of Dylan's
  Tombstone Blues - a fitting finale if there ever was one</Text>
  <Text category="book">While it's certainly true that there will
  always be a gulf between reality and words, communication between
  reader and writer is nonetheless very real and potentially
  profound, thanks in no small part to empathy and the imagination.
  Deconstructionism, by denying presence and instead proposing
  unlimited differences between signs, dismisses any connection
  between readers and writers and turns language into a hermetic
  system separated from the outside world which is, of course,
  inhabited by people who read and people who write. This is
  exactly what makes deconstructionism so empty and hypocritical:
  It rejects traditional metaphysics while adopting a
  pseudo-mystical position which regards language as some unstable
  and solipsistic alien creature independent of everything and
  everyone</Text>

  to be two of the worst actors of all time. It's sheer agony to
  watch these nerds pretend to be macho tough guys. This whole
  flick is akin to getting a gift-wrapped package wrapped in the
  fanciest wrapping paper... Problem is, as is often the case with
  Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez, ain't nothin' inside the package.
  Get it? These guys like the worst movies and have managed to
  become the makers of some of the worst movies ever. The word
  shallow comes to mind. There is nothing there, and I doubt that
  there ever will be. However, having said that, I must give credit
  where credit is due: Juliette Lewis, the talented Juliette Lewis,
  is terrific as usual. Good to see Harvey Keitel do his thing,
  same goes for Fred Williamson, the rarely seen Michael Parks
  (this guy, by the way made some terrific country-type records
  back in the 60's--and we wish he'd do more. He's up there with
  Merle Haggard in my humble opinion) and, last but not least, the
  beautiful Salma Hayek is also in this, although she hardly does
  enough. She still had the curves back then. In addition to the
  above, we could have done without all the obvious and crappy CGI
  effects at the end. The stuff just doesn't work; never did. By
  the way, the documentary FULL -TILT BOOGIE is way better than the
  main feature.</Text>

  which kept me interested. This book falls short unless I would

  written in many languages which is fine, but there are things
  they fail to tell you. I also ordered the Juice AA 4 pack and 2
  of the batteries arrived dead. The charger blinks red with those
  batteries, but the instructions do not even bother telling you
  what a blinking red light means. If you go to the juicebattery
  website, they do not mention this product anywhere. Not even when
  you search for it. A good chance this is a fly-by discontinued
  product. The company themselves have not responded to by blinking

  think this CD is crap. The single star is for the only good song
  on the album, "Heads Carolina, Tails California" -- but really, 1
  star for one good song out of ten is a bit too generous. I'm
  astounded at how bad the other 9 songs are... elementary-school
  rhyming, uninspired melody lines, stupid lyrics, below-average

  habit of overpronnouncing every word in a song... I'd guess
  someone told her at some point that she slurs her words, and she
  was trying to overcompensate. The result should be titled "Hooked

  <Text category="book">As a dad, I was really looking forward to a
  book on potty training to help me with my 2-year old. This book
  is lousy though. Why? 1. Stupid Writing. I got pretty sick of
  constantly reading all the sappy, "witty" remarks. "Dancing the
  Potty Mambo"? Give me a break! 2. Stupid Advice. This book keeps
  telling you to talk to your kid like he/she is an adult. I'm
  sorry, but a 2-year-old just cannot comprehend a long drawn-out
  explanation of why you want them or don't want them to do
  something. How about just saying, "Don't do that!" or "Hey, you
  want to try this?" That seems to work just fine for me. Why give
  your kid a doctoral dissertation every time you want them to do
  something? What's wrong with just telling your kid what to do
  (nicely), and expecting them to be obedient? 3. Repeating
  Content. This book kept repeating itself OVER and OVER. Okay, I
  got it already! I strongly feel that the author wanted to push
  this book over the 200-page mark when all that needed to be said
  could probably have been accomplished in about 50 pages (or
  less). 4. Too Many References. This book constantly refers to
  other chapters. I once counted 6 different references to other
  chapters on one page. I am not kidding! Huh? Is potty training
  really that freakin' complicated? All I want is some general
  ideas on how to go about it, how to get started, and a few good
  tips. I don't need all these detailed references. (Nor do I need
  the phrase "Potty Mambo" repeated to me ad infinitum.) Here is
  all I wanted to know: -How do I get started? -What do I do? -How
  often do I need to try it? -Should I go for pullups or just keep
  him in diapers for the moment? Maybe this book got to all of
  that, but I quit after page 60. I just couldn't take it anymore.
  After hearing the phrases "Stay Positive" and "Potty Mambo"
  repeated to me for the umpteenth time, I had to quit. I returned
  this book and got my money back. If I were to say anything good
  about this book, I would say that it has a few good tips,
  surrounded by about 180 pages of filler. Potty training still
  looms ahead. Will I be successful? Probably. But to this book I

  won't touch it and it was in the way. It doesn't spin very well
  at all (possibly due to the oval shape??) no matter where my
  daughter sits on it. Also the audio is very loud and annoying
  with no volume control. Also it seems much cheaper made than the
  older style she plays with at daycare. I would say DON'T waste
  your money on the Simon Says Sit n Spin - try to find an older
  one at a second hand store or garage sale. My recommendation to
  Playskool would be to go back to the original design - a round
  sit n spin, no sound - just pure and simple fun</Text>

  cases the image is soft and, well, like 16mm. Compared to what
  Fox is releasing of VOYAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA, produced the
  same year (1964) and at the same studio as BOONE, this release is
  nothing short of a disgrace. We should be given pristine 35mm
  source material, and we're not. I suspect Fox wouldn't release
  the original camera negs from it's vaults without a substantial
  fee. Anyway, season one of DANIEL BOONE isn't worth buying. I
  haven't seen season two, when the show started filming in color,

  <Text category="toys_games">I bought this table for my almost 8 month old
  who is starting to pull up on things. I thought this would be
  safe for her to learn to stand with because it has hand grippers
  along the sides of the table (just for that purpose) and is
  recommended for ages 6 months+. All of the fun shapes, colors,
  and sounds immediately caught her attention. She cawled over to
  it and when she tried to pull herself up it fell over ontop of
  her. She bumped her head and cried, but fortunately, wasn't hurt.
  I put a rug under it thinking maybe that would help make it more
  stable, but as soon as she tried to pull up again (within 5
  minutes of taking it out of the box) it fell over on her again.
  The top of the table is very heavy, but the legs are not very
  sturdy, making it topheavy and easy to topple. Needless to say, I
  took it back to the store. I would not recommend this toy unless
  you only wanted to take the legs off and use it on the floor, or
  if you have a toddler who is very steady at standing on his own.
  Personally, I think the recommended age should be changed for
  older children or this toy should be recalled and the legs
  redesigned.</Text>
  <Text category="book">This book was so badly written that I just
  couldn't help writing my first review on Amazon. I NEVER bothered
  writting reviews. While I fully respect the authors' decision in
  providing the book online under the Creative Commons license, and
  while I do not doubt the sincerity of their intentions, the book
  is a total f*ck up. And f*ck up is an understatement. The book:
  1) Is unorganized :- I felt I was being bombarded by information
  from all directions. One moment I was getting ready to test a
  simple "hello world" module, and the other I'm suddenly faced
  with a some strange esoteric block diagram showing "how function
  calls and function pointers are used in a module to add new
  functionality to a running kernel." with strange function names
  that were not mentioned and do not get mentioned for the rest of
  the chapter. How the hell did I get here? It just pisses you off
  and breaks your thought process and leaves you clueless and
  frustrated. 2) Is upside-down:- I read chapter 3 (Char drivers)
  and I compare it to real device drivers and some things just
  don't match. The book seems very theoretical because the "real"
  device drivers call some other functions that are not mentioned
  at all. After digging in the kernel source files and googling the
  internet I realize that in the "real world" there is a whole
  driver-model and generic objects and what not. Reading the source
  code documentation and some online material I actually understand
  how the "real" drivers work. I still don't understand the stuff
  in the book. I start wondering whether there is any mention of
  the driver-model and I find it in chapter 14 !!!!!!! The driver
  model seems, in my opinion, the first step to understanding how
  "real" drivers work and I find it after 14 chapters of utter
  nonsensce!! Not only that, the authors decide that "many driver
  authors can ignore the device model entirely" and "The complexity
  of the device model makes it hard to understand by starting with
  a high-level view"... surpisingly it was easier to understand
  from online sources and the source code documentation than trying
  to read chapter 2 in the book! 3) Is sadistic:- One thing I
  really hated was the carrot-and-stick approach the authors chose.
  First they give you a small tiny taste of a topic which finally
  seems relevant and just when you feel you're about to reach
  somewhere, they do a complete u-turn and throw all kinds of
  irrelevant off-the-topic rubish that leaves you sorry you were so
  shamefull as to expect any better. You end up confused, annoyed,
  and duped. Like in chapter 2 when they presented the code for the
  "hello world" module. OK fine. Seems easy enough. You naturally
  assume that this is an invitation to write the same code
  yourself. HAHA WROONG! The book suddenly does a "make hello.c"
  without showing you the content of the makefile. It leaves you
  out to dry with your uncompilable-"hello.c" and goes on
  describing IN DETAIL seemingly random stuff. You are left
  wondering whether the makefile must have been something too
  obvious to bother noting down and you start wondering whether to
  try to create a simple makefile or continue reading the chapter
  "as-is". I chose the former. HAHAHA WROONG AGAAIIN! I ended up
  compiling my whole kernel source tree because of something they
  decide to mention only 7 sections later.(At least they mentioned
  it?!) In summary.. I'd suggest you buy the book.. and (as
  "./Documentation/ManagementStyle" for another book says): "NOT
  read it. Burn it, it's a great symbolic gesture". I don't think
  anyone could have done a better job at making a worse technical
  book. If you come across any online material that "recommends"
  this book, *QUICKLY* discard that material too .. without
  thinking. This is a -5 stars book. It has affected me
  personally</Text>

  <Text category="toys_games">It's Christmas Day, and believe me, the only
  thing that would get me to sit down at a computer is the level of
  dissatisfaction I've had with the Thomas battery powered engines.
  These trains derail constantly. I think it is because all four
  wheels have power, and the front wheels have too much traction,
  so they are able to climb out of the grooves. Took me all night
  to set up a really cool track, and they derail every 40 seconds
  or so. Read: 3 year old yelling at train. Thank goodness I also
  bought a Brio battery powered engine as well (the Polar Express
  one). It works much better. It has not derailed once all morning.
  It also is better in the following ways: 1) It shuts off after 2
  minutes so you don't lose battery power, 2) it can go into
  freewheel mode when you want to use it without power, 3) it goes
  in reverse, 4) it makes train sounds, 5) the coupling to other
  cars has a swivel which means it is less likely to derail and
  more likely to maintain the magnetic connection, 6) it comes with
  batteries installed. If "Santa Claus" had not disposed of all the
  packaging last night, I would return all the battery operated
  Thomas Trains and go with Brio ones. Note: there is a good thomas
  battery powered car which is the jet engine. This jet engine has
  the swivel, and seems not to derail, maybe because it pushes the
  other cars in front of it</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This movie was just plain bad. It doesn't just
  stink, it reeks. If I was to say this movie was horrible that
  would be a compliment. I can't believe that the other reviews
  were so complimentary. It's the reason why I purchased the movie
  and I regret my decision. I should have read the reviews more
  closely. Some of the reviewers hadn't acutally seen the film
  while I am convinced that a few of the other reviews were written
  by people associated with the film. Everything about this movie
  is sup-par. The script was horrible. The sets amateurish. The
  dialogue stilted. (And not in the funny style reminiscent of the
  TV series - which I loved). There are a number of things about
  the movie that were warning signs that this movie was going to
  stink. First the only footage they used was from the Batman
  movie. Not the TV series. I have a feeling that the people who
  have the rights to the TV series realized that this movie was so
  bad they didn't want to associate themselves with it. They didn't
  use the original Batmobile but a cheap rip off. I could continue
  by why make you suffer. The chemistry between Adam West and Burt
  Ward is non-existent. And the chemistry between the `actors'
  playing Adam West and Burt Ward in the `flashback' scenes is
  substandard at best. This movie is beyond dreadful. There are
  cameos from a few villains from the original TV show but they're
  dreadful too. Not because they are bad actors but because the
  script and plot are that bad. I wish I could say I laughed. I
  wish I could say that I at least cracked a smiled but
  unfortunately all I can say is that I watched this movie in dead
  silence. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY OR YOUR TIME ON THIS MOVI</Text>

  <Text category="music">I hate it when rock stars form those g0d awful
  "supergroups". Can't people see that putting a whole bunch of
  different people from different bands together in one band is
  just a marketing scam and nothing more? There's no such thing as
  a good supergroup. The Supergroup is the only kind of band that
  deliberately tries to $uck. When Damn Yankees released their 1990
  debut, every song on it was so incredibly generic, there was no
  hope for this band. The whole album seemed rushed and thrown
  together. They had nothing meaningful to say with these songs, it
  just seemed like they were pumping out filler and hoping somebody
  would be stupid enough to fall for their "supergroup" scam. The
  big, booming, arena rock choruses just ring hollow. I guess
  they're trying to be catchy and have memorable hooks, but to me,
  it just sounds like a lot of filler. Supergroups will always
  suck, because they diliberately try to sound bad! Thats right
  people! Supergroup members know that since they're already
  popular, the album they're putting out is guaranteed to be a big
  seller----"Why bother trying to come up with good songs? We're
  already popular, so people will buy it no matter how bad it is!
  Lets just put out filler." Supergroups are a TOTAL farce, its
  just easy money for the people involved, and nothing more. If you
  buy ANY album by ANY supergroup, than you my friend, are a
  sucker! If you want to hear Shaw or Blades at their best, just
  keep listening to any Styx or Night Ranger album, and avoid
  anything by Damn Yankees, or any other supergroup</Text>

  <Text category="toys_games">This playhouse theater is an excellent way to

  a house, cave, secret hideout, restaurant, and schoolhouse. Very
  colorful and the front chalkboard is excellent for strenghtening
  writing skills! The only downside I have with the theater is that
  it is not very durable. The theater is made of some sort of
  flimsy plywood and it is not secured with screws, etc. It slides
  together and a child can easily disassemble it. The front panel
  that the child rest's his/her arms on broke after two weeks of

  <Text category="music">I admit to being curious about Rihanna's music
  because like a previous poster from Brooklyn stated " I was not
  trying to become a Rihanna fan!!". I was really pleasantly
  surprised by the quality of this disc and although Rihanna is no
  vocal powerhouse, the songs on the disc were produced in such a
  way as to mask this fact and create more than a few enjoyable
  songs. I really loved her lead single, PON DE REPLAY and since I
  don't listen to the radio, it never grew old to me because I
  heard it so infrequently. It's almost an instantly classic dance
  track with its hypnotic beats &amp;amp; fun lyrics. The other
  standout tracks to me are: HERE I GO AGAIN - like the island
  beats of the music and again, her vocals are utilized well on the
  track WILLING TO WAIT - more of a straight r&amp;amp;b track with
  great beats that again, work well with her vocals LET ME - has an
  interesting "go-go" beat mixed with a middle eastern sound RUSH -
  again, a great dance track It's unfortunate that her vocal skills
  are so slight because there are 2 ballads that although featuring
  very pretty music production, ultimately fail as singles because
  she is such a weak vocalist: THE LAST TIME - Rihanna attempts
  vocal runs that are way out of her league and NOW I KNOW -
  although she has moments where her voice sounds pretty, this song
  would've been a big hit for a stronger singer. Honestly, I'd
  recommend this disc to others who are curious about Rihanna's
  music and to those who like Ashanti - ultimately they are cut
  from the same cloth as "artists". They are able to produce
  enjoyable singles (through the magic of ProTools) but don't do
  much in the way of live vocal performances</Text>

  miscalculated the mileage and sometimes the elevation. I think it

  <Text category="dvd">I won't go into the movie itself, as other
  reviewers have done a more than adequate job of that. Suffice to
  say that I have always enjoyed "Cloak &amp;amp; Dagger," despite
  the hokiness of some of the scenes (not to mention the laughable
  visuals at the end). This movie still rates at least 4 stars from
  me. However, Amazon reviews are supposed to cover the ENTIRE
  product, and not just the movie itself. In two words: It stinks.
  No trailer. No subtitles. No scene selections. No extras of any
  kind. Not even a menu. When you slide the disc in, the movie
  starts right up. When the movie finishes, it starts over again.
  If you press the "menu" button on your remote, nothing happens.
  Personally, I'd prefer it if after the movie finished, playback
  would stop and you'd go to a scene selection menu. Even a still
  image telling you the movie was over would be better than
  playback looping back forever. I suppose I should be glad
  Universal even bothered to release this movie on DVD. It's just
  disappointing that they obviously didn't put any thought or
  effort into it</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Another film in the never-ending series of
  "Giant Animated Snake Eats People" films that have been plaguing
  us for almost a decade. The creators of a maximum-security prison
  in the Antarctic drill into a hollow rock formation and disturb
  the ten-million-plus slumber of 80-foot hungry reptile. There's
  nothing more to this film than that. "Boa" (also known as "New
  Alcatraz") actually takes itself seriously instead of reveling in
  its silliness, which I don't think was a smart idea. The
  technical team - photography, production design-set decoration,
  etc. - create a fairly effective, chilling atmosphere, but
  everything else about "Boa" is strictly routine. Dean Cain does a
  job I would describe as tolerable, although Elizabeth Lackey is
  just that - lacking - as his wife, and the supporting cast (Mark
  Sheppard, Grand L. Bush, Craig Wasson) is just a touch more
  professional. The film-makers actually make the wise move of
  mostly keeping the snake in the dark so we can't see just how
  fake it looks. I don't really recommend it unless you actually
  happen to enjoy this sort of thing to begin with; other, similar
  titles include "Python" 1 and 2, "Anaconda" (the original hokey
  animated killer snake movie of 1997) and "Anaconda: Search for
  the Blood Orchid", and the inevitable "Boa Vs. Python". The DVD
  includes a few trailers and filmographies for the director and
  principal actors. 2/</Text>
  <Text category="book">This book provides excellent information about
  what rheumatoid arthritis is, how to distinguish it from

  want to recover from it. As such, this book offers no help in

  that I can wear to help me from becoming completely disabled, but
  offers me no hope of recovery. In contrast, the book "Conquering

  someone who took charge of their health and fought to recover

  <Text category="health">I've been using this shaver for almost a year,
  and am disappointed with it. For years, I've used the older style
  Remingtons shaped like a rectangular prism. I suppose this new
  shape is intended to fit the hand better, but I never got used to
  it. I find myself supporting the shaver with my other hand
  because I feel like I'll drop it otherwise. The big problem is
  with the screen. Try very hard to avoid letting your skin come in
  contact with the edge of the screen. Otherwise, the blades will
  bite you and sometimes draw blood. To clean, it is easy enough to
  remove the screen assembly, but getting it back on is tricky. If
  not very careful, it goes on unevenly and gets stuck. With
  practice, it usually works the first time. The funniest thing
  about this shaver is the plug that plugs into the wall. It looks
  like a cutting-edge state-of-the-art plug from the 1920s</Text>

  <Text category="book">This is a first person account of a trip to
  the arctic in the 1860's narrated by a Civil War deserter. Within
  the first few pages, our hero enlists, pilfers letters off
  battlefield corpses, deserts, is injured in NYC draft riots, ends
  up in New Bedford, MA and signs up on a sailing ship without
  ryhme or reason or knowing where it was going. The book was
  downhill from there. Page after page described ice and the crew's
  interminable struggles to get through. Getting through the book
  was nearly as interminable. The reader never gets to know the
  narrator enough to empathize with him, or really understand him
  at all. Thus, his struggles ring hollow and he evokes no sympathy
  during his struggles. There are elements of fantasy in the book.
  Not enough to make it a fantasy, but enough to steer a reader off
  course. The scientist on the mission is after a warm Garden of
  Eden in the middle of the Arctic. He is mad or it's fantasy, it
  is hard to know until the end. There is a fantasy interlude when
  a character who has three hands (the most likeable character in
  the book) describes how he got his third hand. From that yarn
  comes the title "Rope Eater". The title really has nothing to do
  with the book, other than rope eaters and the crew members
  suffered pain. Besides the tedious turning of the plot, the
  characters lack any development. Only the three handed man and
  the captain, both tangential characters, had any depth
  whatsoever. This book seemed to be an attempt at adventure, but
  not enough happened between the interminable accounts of ice to
  build much tension. It never developed the aspect of the
  deterioration of the characters - mentally and physically - it
  just happened. Although the reader knew the characters must be
  suffering, it never came through the over-writing. As one might
  expect, the crew's mission to find the warm Garden of Eden in the
  arctic was pointless. So was this book. It was a
  disappointment.</Text>

  past their original sound but are still great. Joni Mitchell
  should have stopped when she was ahead. Maybe I don't rate as a
  JM fan because I've only heard Blue, but I've listened to that
  album hundreds of times times over the years. I wanted to find
  out what she was up to since then, and bought this album. All I
  have to say is, it was like nails on a chalkboard. I was
  EXPECTING her to change and grow, but not into some pale ghost of
  the 60's droning on about the evils of commercialism and

  at erotica were less entertaining than the original, and I found
  Stone's lampshade hairstyle oddly distracting. A couple of things
  kept me viewing this DVD. One was the London setting, which gave
  me an opportunity to see what time has done to one of my old home
  towns. The other was Sharon Stone's rather plucky performance,
  and the presence of Charlotte Rampling, who has aged into a
  different kind of beauty. Morrisey doesn't even come close to
  filling Michael Douglas's shoes, and it's hard to feel sorry for
  him at the end. As with the first movie, you are left with the
  feeling that there was a better film waiting to be made. The
  basic idea of a psychotic novelist who feels compelled to act out
  her fantasies in real life is an intriguing one. However, both
  movies were quick to abandon Hitchcockian understatement for
  speeding cars and gratuitous sex. There's nothing wrong with
  either of these things, but here they just get in the way</Text>

  <Text category="book">As I sat here writting this review my rating
  dropped from a three star rating to a two star rating, and I now
  realize that all of my malice and discontent could have easily
  been diverted if the book were titled "Drawing People: A
  Technical Guide for Beginners" and mentioned nary a word about
  the clothed figure. Then if I had of stumbled upon this book it
  would have been an added bonus that the author took the time to
  outline some basics on clothing and drappery, instead of a full
  out disappointment. Not that I blame the author solely, most of
  the blame lies at my door. I was so overjoyed in finding a book
  that proclaimed it was specifically about drawing the clothed
  figure, Brune Hogath's book aside (another devastating
  disappointment), and that it was written by a professor from the
  Academy of Art, a school that I am still deciding on attending,
  that instead of going my normal route (ordering the book through
  the store, checking it out in person, and then ordering it online
  so I could get a fatty discount) I impulsively bought the book,
  only reading the book synopsis and barely glancing over the
  customer reviews (which all looked favorable). Now I realise my
  folly, and am yet determining whether I'll pay for it (i.e. keep
  the book). I guess what all of my harping boils down to is the
  lack of content instead of the quality, for I can easily discern
  Bradley is an excellent artist with years of knowledge garnered
  from experience, and I'd say that experience shows equally in all
  areas, not just clothing but in setting up a composition and
  following through. The problem is, at least in my opinion, that
  this book is supposed to specifically address clothing, and it
  doesn't for the most part. Roughly one fourth of the book
  pertains to clothing, the other three fourths talk about: how to
  properly hold your drawing implement, how to properly position
  yourself if you are drawing from a live modle, maintaing a daily
  sketchbook, researching your subject matter, the relationships
  between the head neck and shoulders, drawing hands, drawing feet,
  drawing eyes, and a whole slew of other. . .I wouldn't say
  irrelavent, because they are relavent, but not neccessarily the
  most important topics pertaining to drawing the clothed figure. A
  refernce guide on clothing should discuss a plethora of clothing
  materials, and Bradley does on one page with chicken scratch
  detailing. It should outline some of the rules when dealing with
  how clothes tend to fit people of varying body tips, again
  something Bradley discusses on one single page. The differnce
  between water logged clothing and dry clothing, she didn't bother
  mentioning that. How pants typically bunch up while you're
  walking seen from the head on, profile, three quaters, and back
  view, another topic she failed to mention. Some examples of
  evening/ formal attire vs. day clothes, how clothing reacts when
  the subject is in motion, how jackets restrain your actions and
  bunch up, the effect of wearing multiple layers at once,
  achieving that perfect windswept look, and all manner of other
  topics that should appear in an artistic clothing refernce guide.
  Maybe I'm being too harsh on Bradley, after all she does mention
  in her preface that there aren't a whole lot of books pertain to
  drawing the clothed figure, and compared to the standard "how to.
  . ." books she's leaps and bounds ahead of the rest. Oh yeah,
  that's another thing, she doesn't outline any steps on how to
  achieve a realistic rendering like- first start out with a cone
  pointing upward then draw a sphere at the bottom/base. The sphere
  represents the weight of the gathered cloth so the stress lines
  originate from the tip of the cone and travel down the length
  eventually enveloping the sphere. Note the ripples. -or some junk
  like that. Back to me not being to harsh on Bradley, I guess in
  reading she is/was a professor in the arts I thought she would
  have some understanding of the common impediments modern day
  artist face when depicting clothing. For all who have read this
  drawn out rant, two maybe three people, and think I'm all talk,
  trust me if I had the skills I'd come up with my own series of
  "How to draw. . ." books and address all of my issues. As is I'm
  pretty good at drawing dynamic figures, but the second I add
  clothing they become flat, lifeless caricatures and I don't see
  this book as alleviating my shortcomings much. As is my own
  artistic habits (drawing from magazines, online pics, and
  occasionally stepping outside of my cave to draw people in
  motion) are a match for the few helpful hints in this book.
  You're better off doing what you've always done plus artistically
  drapping to a wall or over a piece of furniture from time to time
  then buying this book. If you do know of a book that addresses
  even half of the afore mentioned topics, if you could write a
  review mentioning them, somehow recommend them to me or whatever
  I'd be eternally in your debt</Text>

  <Text category="book">This book is pretty much useless if you're
  looking for info on how to build a dulcimer. Only about 60 pages
  of it actually talks about dulcimer making/repair. The rest is a
  long winded history/bio of Homer Ledford. Some of that is a bit
  interesting from an historical/cultural perspective, but the
  author beats it to death. Homer wanted the book to be just on how
  to build and care for a dulcimer; the rest was the author's idea.
  Dean Kimball's book on dulcimer making is better, although still
  lacking in some areas. This book has no patterns or plans, few
  useful photos, and is weak in what instruction it does provide.
  There are a few useful ideas but not worth the price of the

  <Text category="dvd">After seeing both Peyton Place and the sequel
  I can tell you that I could tolerate the recast, Carol Lynley and
  Tuesday Weld were wonderful in their perspective parts. But I
  have to wonder was it only the cast that changed in this sequel
  did the writers change as well? My reasons for asking, the
  glaring inconsistencys to the original movie. Over and over in
  this film it is stated that Selena was raped when she was
  thirteen, yet in the original film Selena, Alison and the others
  were graduating from high school when the incident occured. Since
  when do thirteen year olds graduate from high school, also she
  looked pretty mature for thirteen. Then there's Selen'as
  boyfriend (whose name escapes me at the moment) in the original
  film he stood by her, through the murder charges, the revelation
  of the rape, and the miscarriage, yet in the sequel I'm suppose
  to buy that he couldn't handle any of it dumped her and left town
  where he met and married someone else. Then all the towns people
  after being put in their place by the town Doctor all rallied
  together at the end of the original film to give their support of
  Selena, yet in the sequel she is considered the town outcast? I
  have nothing against sequels even with recast but this one
  strayed way too far from its original film that all creditbility
  for it as a sequel went out the door. It was all too obvious that
  the original film wasn't taken into account when writing the
  sequel. Not credible at all</Text>

  <Text category="music">Looking at the liner photos makes clear that
  Falkner is the prettiest thing this side of N Sync (and doesn't
  he know it, especially in the shot of him being served what
  appears to be a large dose of Johnnie Walker Black by a leggy
  Bunny Flight Attendant). Which raises the question: is this the
  recond a boy band member would turn out if he got the idea he was
  an ARTIST? Not to put too fine an edge on it, let's say bluntly
  that this is a vanity project by a middling talent. Falkner does
  everything on the CD and my reaction is so what? His voice is
  mediocre; his lyrics are banal (&amp;amp;quot;Life can be just
  like a painting full of wonderful strangeness&amp;amp;quot;) or
  precious (&amp;amp;quot;Suspended on this stage of grace I have
  to remember this sound&amp;amp;quot;); the layers of sound he
  tracks down are just that -- layers of sound, with a disspiriting
  sameness song after song. Give him two stars simply because he
  CAN do all the stuff on the record, but this guy needs to become
  a whole lot less full of himself and to spend a year or two
  listening to, say, Chrissie Hynde and John Hiatt CDs. We'll let
  him come back then and try to write and play some adult love

  <Text category="music">Alright....own up. Which idiots are
  responsible for the release of this "Musicals" collection? Since

  These two movies are hard hitting dramas with a similar

  that, just because Harry Belafonte sings the title song over the
  credits, this does NOT make "Island in the Sun" a musical. I
  suppose in their book, because Shirley Bassey sings the title
  song over the credits, this makes "Goldfinger" a musical too ??
  It makes me so mad that we have idiots in charge of releasing
  these great old movies who have no idea what they are doing. It

  <Text category="book">This book is a small bundle of common
  knowledge wrapped up in an insulting amount of hyperbole and
  hucksterism (and very bad English). Just how many times can you
  claim a technique will improve your workouts "by a factor of ten"
  or is the most valuable breakthrough "in history" before you lose
  all credibility? In the first 30 pages, winnowing out the fluff,
  I read this: 1) Fad diets, bulimia, and steroids are bad for you.
  2) Gaining muscle and losing fat are biologically distinct
  processes, so they require two classes of exercises. 3) It's good
  to concentrate your attention on the particular muscles you are
  using during weight-training routine. 4) Creative visualization
  and self-hypnosis can help you reach your goals. (OK, I'm a bit
  skeptical about this one.) In other words, this book has taught
  me nothing of value that I didn't already know. Looking ahead in
  the index, I can see much more of the same. I'm afraid I've been

  <Text category="dvd">Well, i just got done watching this movie and
  actually went out of my way to write this review. Truthfully, i
  didn't catch the last 20 or so minutes because i found myself
  doing other things around the house and could care less about
  what happend. The trailers and the DVD cover of this movie is
  very misleading. One would think that they are going to see
  something from a great genre of horror movies about zombies and a
  group of people doing whatever it takes to survive. I'm a big fan
  of Romero movies and loved 28 days later so i thought this movie
  would be a cool australian take-off. I couldn't be more wrong.
  Nothing in the movie makes sense from the start. The entire movie
  is over the top starting with the actors. Everybody has entirely
  too much dialogue except for the main character who hardly says
  two words during the entire movie. She looks lost, confused, and
  out of her league. Other characters include a local pilot and his
  pregnant girlfriend, a "wacky" police sgt with his asthmatic
  partner, the bait &amp;amp; tackle clerk who never screams during
  the entire movie, and our heroin character who won the local
  beauty contest. The movie takes place in a small town in
  austrialia somewhere. When meteors strike the earth (and slam
  into people), it unleashes a germ which causes people to become
  zombies. Our main characters all meet up and try to survive.
  However, aliens are involved so the story goes from a survival
  story to beams of light dressed in capes and floating around
  right in the middle of a big battle. The viewer is left to wonder
  what's going on at first, but as the dialogue and story become
  unbearably bad, you find yourself not caring as the minutes tick
  by. I honestly couldn't tell you much else because it's just so
  terrible that I just simply couldn't take a minute more. Bad
  acting, bad dialogue, over the top effects, and some of the worst
  camera work i've ever seen. This movie apparently took two years
  to make... imagine if they only had one??? Another portion of
  this movie that makes me ill is the bait &amp;amp; tackle
  charater. He shows up out of nowhere and saves the heroin's life
  like a bad clint eastwood impression (with big hat covering his
  eyes to boot). Then, he walks away. When he appears again, he's
  able to do these matrix style backflips (digging his "spurs" into
  the wall/ceiling) and making two pistols jump over his back and
  land directly into his hands. Does this guy ever miss? What do
  you think? He manages to kill about 50 zombies with his two
  pistols while hanging from the wall upside down. Not bad for a
  bait and tackle salesman living in the backwoods of australia! If
  you dig the gore, this one is ok... but again, wayyyy over the
  top. I had no idea that one bullet from a .45 could blow someone
  in half. Our characters are so clueless that it actually takes
  them 3/4 of the movie to figure out how to shoot them in the
  head. I personally counted several scenes where a character is
  shooting a police revolver and somehow manages to get 13 shots
  out of a 6 shooter. Someone get NASA on the phone and explain how
  you can do that because i just don't get it. The absolutely worst
  part of this movie, without a doubt, is the music. It never
  stops! There's never a scene without music for some reason! And
  it just makes what you're watching seem absolutely cheesy! It
  reminded me of a 1950's serial/pirate swashbuckling kind of thing
  with guys swinging on ropes and jumping across a gorge kind of
  thing. The soundtrack is truly the worst i've ever heard with
  extra cheese included. Did they use up their budget on the
  effects? Probably! I found myself wishing that i could mute the
  music during the film! If you're a fan of good monster / zombie
  movies, i beg you to pass this one by and keep on moving. It
  doesn't make sense, the story is amazingly weak, the plot is...
  well, there isn't one... you'll wish you could have your 2 hours
  back. I know i do!!!</Text>
  <Text category="book">In seeking to develop my own grant writing
  course, I reviewed 20 books on Amazon. I was sold on this one by
  its extremely high Amazon.com Sales Rank...probably the highest
  of this category. Nevertheless, I was shocked and taken aback by
  a comment on the introduction page, that harkened back to my
  eighth-grader days: "You'll learn that in grant writing you
  especially need to cultivate two abilities: meeting deadlines and
  following directions." Despite the obvious comprehensiveness of
  the materials presented in the book from Ms Burke-Smith's
  experience, I don't know who's responsible for the talking-down
  attitude presented here. This is my first EVERYTHING title, and I
  don't know if all EVERYTHING titles are like this, or if it's
  from award-winning business writer Ms Tremore. All I know is
  after getting such an Introduction, what reader would wish to
  proceed into the book's depths with that kind of attitude by
  one's hoped-for mentors?</Text>
  <Text category="music">For those who were fortunate enough to aquire
  one of the first two releases of the THIEF soundtrack (like
  myself) congratulations - you have the version of the CD that
  contains the best song on the soundtrack, Beach SCENE. It has
  been dropped for this US release. For those who were interested
  in obtaining the Thief soundtrack being mainly interested in the
  one song, Beach SCENE (most of the other songs can be found on
  other Tangerine Dream albums), please realise the following
  differences between Beach THEME and the now dropped, Beach SCENE.
  The song, Beach THEME is a much shorter track (almost by half)
  and there is a very cheesy, acoustic, "rock n' roll", drum beat
  that was mixed/dubbed over the original Beach SCENE song which
  has the much more mellow and less invasive electronic, sequenced
  drum beat in it. It's Beach SCENE that was both heard in the
  movie and over the airwaves back in 1981. If that is the song you
  remember (fell in love with) and are looking for, do NOT buy this
  latest release. Keep looking for those Out Of Print CDs - they
  are out there. On a lighter "note", it's very nice to see they
  added the ending/end-credits song, CONFRONTATION. This is a
  lose/win scenario for THIEF soundtrack fans - it all depends on
  which song is more important to you. If you already have the
  earlier releases with Beach SCENE on it then buying this latest
  version will now complete a defninitve soundtrack for them as
  that last song in the movie has now finally been added to the
  official soundtrack</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">all non-yellow parts of the ducks are painted
  and come off pretty easily. a little moisture and some teeth for
  a minute can remove paint. this toy is best for those who are
  past placing toys or anything in their mouth. I still think they
  are cute and a great idea...just need to be made
  better/safer</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I agree with all of the other reviews about
  this tent and its durability, however my daughter absolutely
  loves it. First the three plastic sticks that come with the tent
  to hold it open broke and warped pretty quick. I went to Home
  Depot and bought three wooden dowels for 79 cents each and cut
  them to the correct length and it works great. My daughter uses
  this mostly inside and it is fine, when outside the wind and
  everything else did move it around. I bought a 4 pack of plastic
  tent stakes from target for about $1 and put one in each corner
  to hold it in place, works great. I think we paid $19 for this at
  Target and it definitely seems worth the amount of enjoyment my
  daughter gets. If you are expecting a $200 high quality camping
  tent, you will probably be disappointed</Text>
  <Text category="music">I have never been able to see what the big
  deal was about this band. All of their records, in general, sound
  exactly the same, and this one is no exception. Post-Velvets
  guitar/organ drones, lackadaisical vocals, blankly uninteresting
  non-lyrics (they could have recited their grocery lists and it
  would have been more interesting), and a dramatic lack of energy;
  all of Yo La Tengo's trademarks are fully represented here, and
  if you can stay awake through it, you're a better man/woman than
  I. A surpassingly boring record, even from this usually very
  boring band. If you've heard the Velvet Underground, Neu!,
  Stereolab's early records, and Sonic Youth, you've heard Yo La
  Tengo in total. If you're a big enough fan of those named bands,
  YOU could probably write songs that sound like
  &amp;amp;quot;Painful.&amp;amp;quot; But you would probably write
  better ones. Avoid this like the plague unless you suffer from
  insomnia</Text>
  <Text category="health">The bath seat was easy to put together and
  satisfactory to use. But some of the metal hardware that was
  provided for use in assembling the seat was not rust-proof, and
  rusted after several weeks of use. It makes no sense to make a
  product used under water that contains metal parts that are not
  rust-proof.</Text>
  <Text category="music">I was disappointed by Ms. Jackson. Though it's
  not such a big loss b/c i didn't pay much for it. None of the

  <Text category="toys_games">With five kids under the age of 9 and four
  Leapsters in the house, there is rarely a time when someone isn't
  playing one (if not all!) of them. We have about 10 of the
  cartridges, and this was the most disappointing (followed closely
  by Spiderman). There simply isn't enough for them to do with it.
  The beauty of the Leapster is the ability to interact with the
  games, and learn while they do it. Watching a video on a 2 inch
  screen just doesn't cut it.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I have never understood why people find this
  to be the pinnacle of British Comedy. Once you get past the
  numerous jokes about Mrs. Slocum's.... cat and a flaming Mr.
  Humphreys you have very little left to justify it's long run
  except that it was probably the right show in the right place at
  the right time. In retrospect it is lacking. Many will disagree
  with me but that's life</Text>
  <Text category="health">I had this for about 2 years, and was not
  impressed. It worked for a month or so, and since then, does
  nothing. If you fill it up with water, and then plug it in for
  several days, the water level never goes down. I've tried
  cleaning it repeatedly, and tried various things to make it work,
  but apparently it's just dead. It was a cheap product; you get
  what you pay for</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I picked this item up for my 6 year old nephew
  who loves science. We put it together one night and I was
  surprised to find that the base and volcano are incredibly thin
  plastic that crack under any pressure at all. The plaster/sand
  mixture was impossible to work with, it just balled up into
  clumps and there was no real way of spreading it around smoothly.
  We both ended up with plaster all over us. Once it had dried, he
  was excited to get to paint it. As soon as he began to paint,
  parts of the plaster started breaking off in chunks. Hooking the
  plastic tubing up was not a major problem but I had issues
  keeping it hooked together. The "pump" system was supposed to
  send vinegar into a baking soda chamber to push up into the
  volcano. Instead the "pump" (which was a squeeze bottle) pushed
  the vinegar weakly upwards and then once it hit the baking soda
  chamber it clogged up. When it finally made its way out through
  the volcano after me squeezing the bottle as hard as possible, it
  barely trickled out. Once it had trickled enough, the rest of the
  plaster fell off as it got wet. He and his sisters just looked at
  me and asked "Is that it?" After three tries we trashed the whole
  thing. Also, the "rock samples" that they give you in the kit are
  the size of the tip of your fingernail. I'm a geologist and these
  are not rare, expensive rocks. There was no reason to not include
  larger samples. He was very disappointed in the whole thing and
  so was I. I can't believe that the Smithsonian put their name on
  this product. We'll go back to our plaster volcano with vinegar
  and baking soda</Text>
  <Text category="music">JUST LIKE IN MY OTHER REVIEW I CAN'T FIGURE
  OUT THE MADNESS OVER THESE GUYS. I WILL ASK IN THIS POST AS WELL
  FOR SOMEBODY TO ACTUALLY EXPLAIN TO ME WHY THEY SHOULD BE HEARD
  AND ARE RELEVANT IN A CREATIVE WAY. HONESTLY PEOPLE YOU CAN'T
  CALL THESE GUYS ARTISTS. AN ARTIST CREATES SOMETHING FROM A IDEA
  OR TWO THESE GUYS TAKE THOSE IDEAS AND JUST LUMP THEM TOGETHER.
  IT'S AS SIMPLE AS THAT. AND TO TOP IT OF THEY DON'T HAVE THE
  CHOPS AS MUSICIANS TO BE RELEVANT IN THAT FORM EITHER. A COMMENT
  LIKE "THEY ROCK" OR "THE LEAD SINGER IS SOOOO HOT" AREN'T
  EXAMPLES OF A GREAT ARTIST OR BAND. FROM THE DATES OF THE LAST
  POST MY WORDS MIGHT BE IN VAIN, KIND OF LIKE THE VALIDITY OF THIS
  RECORD. BECAUSE THERE HASN'T BEEN A POST ON HERE FOR TWO YEARS.
  IF A FAN OF BANKING BENJAMINS DOES STUMBLE UPON THIS POST I
  INVITE YOU TO CHECK OUT MY OTHER REVIEWS, AND CHECKOUT SOME
  RELEVANT AND GREAT MUSIC</Text>
  <Text category="book">If you like physics, this is just an
  interesting book. It mostly discusses, at length, two ideas:
  emergence and reductionism. Doesn't sound like much, and it
  isn't, but at least it gives you a different point of view on the
  world. Unfortunately, from this point of view to the horizon is
  not that far. Mr. McLaughlin almost calls the present theories
  (like string theory) science fiction, easy on science (because of
  the scales and energies involved, he seems to think they are not
  provable; I don't have the knowledge to discuss if he is right or
  not), but he doesn't offer much of an alternative. He even comes
  close to saying that deeper levels of understanding are not
  possible, or not practical. Well, even if he is right, which I
  hope he isn't, between can't and science fiction, I prefer
  science fiction. Tomorrow I'll read a bit of string theory, and
  shake off the depressive mood left by this book</Text>
  <Text category="music">It Might not be A good Album but it definitely
  shows Shania's potential</Text>
  <Text category="music">Look, as music goes, variations on a theme is
  part of any genre. This album, however, yells out
  &amp;amp;quot;leave well enough alone.&amp;amp;quot; A remix of
  Sgt.Peppers LHCB might thrill a person born in 1986, but when you
  hear the real thing, you ask why change it? This album is a total
  waste of a truly great disc. Like Gipeto said to Pinocchio,
  &amp;amp;quot;stay wood!&amp;amp;quot</Text>

  <Text category="health">There are so many different sites that all
  tell you that 'they' have the best absorbed CoEnzyme Q10
  manufactured. It's hard to know who is really telling the
  absolute truth or just propagandizing a product for quick sale.
  We are born with extremely high levels of CoEnzyme Q10 and then
  it gets slowly used up as the years pass even if we actually eat
  the foods that resupply our bodies. And who purposefully eats
  these foods for the CoEnzyme Q10 content? The mitochondria in
  every single cell in our body needs this coenzyme for production
  of energy. By the time we are over 40, our levels have dropped
  significantly and our energy levels have dropped with it. I must
  admit that this Nature's Made product does NOT seem to increase
  my energy level like other company's CoEnzyme Q10 does. So, from
  my own reaction to this product, I do not recommend this
  particular CoEnzyme Q10. There are several other companies that
  make excellent, effective products (like Dr. Whitaker's and Dr.
  Sinatra's and Dr. William's) but not this Nature Made
  product</Text>

  not appear under window it seemed to be covered with a dark

  <Text category="music">I can't believe rubbish like this goes
  platinum. Rap today with a few exceptions is a joke. People like
  Chingy, Nelly, Ludacris, Ja Rule, Lil Jon and any other idiot
  with Lil in their name are ruining rap and making it look like a
  joke. What is really getting me angry is how so many people don't
  give any respect to real rap legends like Tupac and Biggie, and
  give tons of respect to all these clowns. People are thinking
  this is the sort of stuff rap fans listen to. All these people
  talk about is money, bling bling and sex. Rap used to be about
  the streets now its just all i've got so much money and stuff. If
  you want a real rap CD then get one of the following. NWA -
  Straight Outta Compton Ice Cube - Amerikka's Most Wanted Dr Dre -
  The Chronic Snoop Doggy Dogg - Doggystyle Nas - Illmatic Tha Dogg
  Pound - Dogg Food Tupac - Me Against The World Tupac - All Eyez
  On me Tupac - Greatest Hits 50 Cent - Power Of The Dollar Biggie
  - Life After Death You get the picture</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I purchased the Havoc Heli for my dad. He saw
  an ad for it on TV and wanted one, so I was excited that
  Amazon.com had it for a lower cost and free shipping. However,
  that was as far as the "good" went. My dad was disappointed to
  find out that not only could the Havoc Heli not pick up and fly
  with the accessories that came with it, but it had a difficult
  time flying without any "extra weight". This helicopter has no
  risk of creating any havoc. But, it does make a cute little
  paperweight.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I was so excited about this product; but when
  I got it I was deeply dissatisfied. The box was damaged. It was
  bent inward at the lid on one side and around the drawers opening
  it was ripped on both sides. I will be returning this product for
  a replacement. I do think that the box is really cute. However if
  I receive another damaged box then I will never buy another thing
  from this website</Text>
  <Text category="health">I have found another product that I want to
  recommend. It's called Alert and is sold by consultants like
  Avon, but you can also go the Starlight website and order it.
  It's a nutritional supplement and for me does provide energy
  without the jitters, and as a bonus I don't feel hungry when I'm
  using it. They also have a product specifically for weight loss.
  I have tried that as well. I did feel a bit jittery at first...
  but it settled after a week or so of taking it. I would recommend
  it also. I used it a few years ago and lost 35 lbs. I did
  consistent diet and exercise which obviously is what did the
  weight loss, but I credit the supplement with giving me the
  energy to get moving and helping me curb cravings. I'm now
  looking for energy and help maintaining that weightless so for me
  the alert does both of what I need ... energy and hunger control
  and it's less expensive than the weight loss supplement so I now
  use it. I've used this for years and have not had any
  problems.</Text>

  <Text category="health">This is one of the dullest chick lit

  falsely sweet dolts. Don't waste your money</Text>

  <Text category="book">I bought this Barbie after seeing two pictures
  of angel Barbies on the website and reading the Manufacturer's

  description, which matched one of the pictures, was the correct
  angel. The doll with the light blue dress is not impressive at
  all. It is very simple with vinyl wings. Be aware of which you
  are purchasing, the description is deceptive and incorrect</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Horrible advertising on these packages. It
  shows a huge delicious bowl of pasta when says 4 pack, but it
  only makes two "bowls" of pasta. The servings are so tiny, that
  if you make both packets together, you maybe get a half a bowl of
  pasta. Not to mention that it takes about 11-15 minutes to cook!
  Pasta's so sticky you have to use no-stick spray. The taste is so
  bad my son, who eats anything wouldn't touch it, and the sauce
  packet was hard as a rock, so it didn't mix up and left big
  chunks in the ketchup you have to add. We tried the mac and
  cheese too, it takes 15 minutes to cook and again says 4 pack,
  but that's only 2 pastas and 2 cheeses. Very expensive, hardly
  any food, and pretty nasty to eat. They need to be alot more
  realistic on their packaging instead of trying to use false
  pictures and saying "4pack" Eight thumbs down from this

  Unless you want to read a book written by people who are SO MUCH

  <Text category="book">It took two people to write this book? I was
  pleased to see a chick lit book for the 40-something reader but
  this book really was a waste of my time. You can see the ending a
  mile away, for one, but that didn't really bother me. It was the
  writing. The main character suffers from a syndrome that's
  unfortunately common to chick-lit heroines, which is to speak in
  an overly quippy, aren't-I-clever with my snappy dialog way.
  Nearly every one of her sentences included a quip/joke (or a
  quippy thought in her head as she spoke). Real people just don't
  talk that way, and it makes it impossible to relate to or care
  about her. By the way, my copy had the first chapter of these
  authors' next book attached at the end, and they've basically
  created the same two main characters: the quippy single mom and
  her ridiculously glamorous best friend. I won't bother with
  it</Text>
  <Text category="music">The music on this album is performed so
  exquisitely; the orchestrations so subtle and yet illuminating,
  that one is almost tempted to forget what a "What for?" musical
  this is. Donna Murphy plays the title character of Fosca, a
  hugely unprepossessing woman who suffers from more maladies than
  there are stars in the sky. She lives in a remote miltary outpost
  where she falls in love with the handsome, virile Giorgio.
  Giorgio in turn is having a torrid affair with the beautiful, but
  vapid Clara, a married woman back home. However from the time
  Giorgio comes into Fosca's sphere, she becomes this relentless
  succubus in her pursuit of him. She shows up EVERYWHERE he
  happens to be; her ferocity matched only by her inexhaustive
  capacity for self-pity. To depict Fosca musically, Sondheim comes
  up with the most monochromatic score of his career. Everything is
  SO lugubrious, dark, portentous, tragic; punctuated by
  militaristic strains (with snare drums)because the soldiers like
  to...umm...march. In the end, Giorgio is worn down enough by
  Fosca's attentions that he succumbs. He believes he has fallen in
  love with her, shortly after which she...dies. As I mentioned
  earlier, the material is beautifully performed (Marin Mazzie and
  Jere Shea render the opening "Happiness" with a marvelous sense
  of delicacy and sensuality. Donna Murphy evokes the proper pathos
  in the haunting "Loving You."), but you come away wondering what
  the point of it all is. If Sondheim is trying to show us how love
  is largely a chronic disease, then he succeeds admirably</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My daughter had a drink and wet doll that she
  could give a bath but it filled up with water and even though you
  couldn't empty all the water out, it still leaked everywhere. I
  got rid of it hoping she wouldn't notice. Well, she did, so a new
  "doll I can give a bath to" was on her Christmas list. I wanted
  to find a solid rubber doll that would not fill up with water.
  Like the dolls I had as a child. I thought this would be it since
  the top half visible in the box appeared to have no holes. Wrong.
  It has a soft torso filled with polystyrene beads that get
  waterlogged. The water all (I hope) drains out of the bottom of
  the feet after a couple of minutes of squeezing. Then you have to
  let the torso drip dry. Last night after bathtime, my daughter
  wanted to tuck her doll into to the doll cradle, but couldn't
  because she was still wet. The other features are fine. The
  shower works great. You don't have to fill up the fish. Just
  attach it to the tube and squeeze. It suctions water from the
  bottom of the floaty. The doll doesn't sit upright in the floaty,
  but she doesn't flop completely over, either. I don't care for
  the bow sewn on to the head. Who takes a bath with a bow on? But
  if you take it off, she'll have holes in her head</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Why? Why waste your time and money on
  producing crap? Sony execs must be out of their minds. The
  Ghostbuster fans have been waiting years, and writing countless
  petitions to get the episodes on DVD, and this is what they come
  up with? No. Give us season DVDs. Give us a 140 episode box set.
  Give us something. Not 4 non-sequential episodes on a disc that
  can hold MANY times that. What a waste. This product gets 1 star
  because, apparently, you can't give it zero</Text>
  <Text category="book">I found it to lean very heavily towards a
  hierarchal view of the relationship between men and women. Men
  are to rule, and women are to submit to that rule. The authors
  appear to see women as perpetual children who need to be under
  the continual domination of men, rather than as adults who deal
  with men on an adult level. I suggest anyone who reads this books
  should also read "Discovering Biblical Equality." It gives
  another view of how the Christians world see the role of
  women</Text>
  <Text category="book">I forced myself to finish this book before I
  reviewed it, and being through with it now, I feel as though I've
  learned very little. I had so many problems with this book, or
  rather the way of writing, mostly stemming from the completely
  pompous arrogance of the author, that this was a difficult read.
  In his defense, he is, in MOST things, very thorough. My main and
  overwhelming problem with this book was that the author was
  arrogant enough to believe that he could relay what Leonardo was
  (or as he sometimes put it &amp;amp;quot;must have
  been&amp;amp;quot;) thinking or feeling. While I give Mr. Bramly
  credit as a man very much versed in his subject, in my opinion,
  that still gives him no right to use what I understood to be a
  faithful biography as a place to put forward his own views. Since
  he himself stresses that Leonardo's famous notebooks contain
  little to no personal thoughts or feelings, he has no basis for
  those statements and they are only his overconfident
  postulations. In the instances that there is a controversy over
  some area of Leonardo's life, the author is very good about
  stating that there is a dispute regarding the matter, but only
  puts forward his OWN opinion, and his reasons why he believes
  what he does, without explaining the opposite side of the matter.
  In this manner, he forces his thoughts on the reader without
  leaving them any choice in the matter. Sentences beginning with
  &amp;amp;quot;I think&amp;amp;quot; or &amp;amp;quot;In my
  view&amp;amp;quot; are not uncommon. He also makes certain
  assumptions about the reader, referring often to other artists'
  works with the assumption that the reader is as knowledgeable as
  he is about them. Also, he occasionally goes into great detail
  regarding a painting or drawing of Leonardo's, often drawing
  attention to coloring or texture, without ever showing it, though
  the book has many drawings and paintings throughout. The author
  is an undoubtedly intelligent, well-learned man, very erudite
  where Leonardo da Vinci is concerned, but entirely overbearing in
  his writing. Overall, unless you are well versed in the

  this one</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Okay, the rating above is not going to be
  liked but I have to be truthful. The only good thing going for
  this movie was the return of "Snake Plissken". This film's plot
  was essentially a rehash of the original "Escape From New
  York"...A bit more special effects (which in fact, did not make
  this a better movie)... When I go to a sequel I expect to get
  what I paid for a totally new adventure with the same character /
  characters. Kurt Russell's character is older and even more in
  the know of what the rewards are before he is offered them.
  Obviously the movie doesn't really know where it's going as it
  takes two scenes (15 minutes of the film) (1st scene - President,
  Commandant, and Lackey give Snake the mission) (2nd scene -
  Commandant and Lackey brief Snake before he leaves for the
  mission) to explan to the audience what's the basic conflict. I
  guess either Carpenter or Russell are just getting too old to
  take a GREAT leap and recount either an earlier Snake Plissken
  adventure or an adventure well worth telling.. I also wish to
  comment that this disc has no special features besides a movie
  trailer... "Carpenter....Russell! " Please don't tell me "money"
  caused you to revisit a "cult figure"! Some redeeming qualities
  are the acting performances of Cliff Robertson, Stacy Keach,
  Steve Buscemi, and Pam Grier. Robertson, Keach, and Grier may be
  old but they can sure make you believe in their characters!
  Sorry, Snake...."I don't love L.A."

  <Text category="music">I loved "Come Away With Me" the first moment I
  heard it. I also had the opportunity to see Norah and her
  wonderful band in concert ... the experience was absolutely

  waited in eager anticipation for her new album "Feels Like Home"

  perfectly honest, I haven't listened to it since. She is so

  <Text category="book">I had heard of the importance, and
  significance of "The Education of Henry Adams" for a long time. I
  finally determined I needed to read it. I acutally read it twice,
  and found less in it the second time than the first. I am sorry I
  missed the greatness of this book. I am sure there was something
  wrong with me, but I found it to be incredibly unimpressive.
  Perhaps this came from the fact that Henry Adams was not a
  likeable man. He was famous for holding court in his home near
  the White House, and making caustic and negative comments about
  every President who lived there. Granted, he lived in Washington
  at a time when there were plenty of second-rate occupants of the
  White House. But the thought of people wasting their time trying
  to please a blue-blooded snob like Adams depresses me. Why did
  anyone bother? He lived in an atmosphere of snobbery,
  sharp-tongues, clever remarks, and brilliant conversation. The
  world went on without him, truth be told, and he contributed less
  than the people who walked by his house each day. He was a very
  good historian in his time. But who reads his books now? Not very
  many. In short, his own work was not as long-lasting as he would
  have wanted it to be. Maybe the influence of some of the
  Presidents he mocked lasted longer than the published and
  purchased work of Henry Adams. "The Education of Henry Adams"
  does not have much real information. He got education in one
  place, none in others. Surely, the suicide of his wife provided
  some very painful education for Henry--but he wrote nothing about
  it in his book. When Eric Sevareid wrote "Not So Wild a Dream,"
  it was compared to "The Education of Henry Adams." That was meant
  as a compliment. Oddly, I think Sevareid's book is much, much
  better. Sevareid wrote of America, the common man, the war, and
  what it all meant to him. Adams needed to get out more. He did
  not see America--not the America built by the common citizen who
  put it all together, and defended it. I gained a trememdous
  amount from Sevareid. I cannot say the same for the work of Henry
  Adams. Again, a lot of this might be me. Perhaps I read the book
  at a bad time. Maybe I needed to read it a third time. I do not
  know. I do know I do not think this is a great American classic.
  Forgive, please, my ignorance.</Text>
  <Text category="book">This is my first Ludlum book and it is sure to
  be my last. The plot is preposterous because of Ludlum's limited
  understanding of economics and history. Once you realize that,
  all interest in the story falls away. It starts off plausible
  enough...and the blurbs on the jacket imply some "weapon" more
  powerful than a mere 270 million dollars! Hitler gained power
  because of the alignment of a number of situations that made the
  ground fertile for his brand of megalomania. Some spoiled, rich
  American brat and his fortune would hardly make a difference to
  the currents of history. I know that this is only supposed to be
  a work of fiction, and it is all in good fun, but the
  plot-concept needs to be much more believable to hold my
  interest. If you don't need logic in your fiction, it's
  interesting enough as a cloak and dagger story, but it falls far
  short in the historical (and economic) fiction department</Text>

  <Text category="health">I am a big fan of the regular CliC reading
  glasses. I own several pairs and think they are great. However,
  the Sport Goggles DO NOT get my vote of confidence. They have
  three problems which make them unusable for me: 1) on all CliC
  products there is an all important stem adjustment that adjusts
  the length of the stems to properly fit the glasses onto your
  head. However, unlike the very cool regular reading glasses by
  CliC, the Sport Googles do not adjust properly and so the Goggles
  run very tight if you need even a slightly above average stem
  legnth, 2) there is also extra foam padding on the Sport Googles
  that make them very snug, but because of the tight stems the foam
  padding makes these glasses far too tight to enjoy and 3)the
  maker doesn't make it as clear as they should in their
  description ... the Irridium (Red)colored lens on some of the
  Sports Goggles are far too intensely tinted and dark for any kind
  of regular light conditions or applications like morning driving
  ... or even safe walking on a rocky path. Sorry Clic, but your

  I find on the album is the "Club Mix" of "Turn It Around." But if
  we think about that for a second, aren't we talking about "club
  music" here afterall? Are we under any pretenses that this is
  elevator or lobby music? I should think not. What we expect from
  this band, and from a second album is an equal or better effort
  at club music. House-ish, trance-ish, and anthemic. It's just
  missing on Turn it Around. I wholeheartedly recommend Believe,

  <Text category="dvd">Tony Kushner's liner notes are a chilling
  foretaste of his Jew-hatred-soaked script for the film "Munich."
  A paragon of self-regard, he sneers at the historicity and
  compelling morality of the Jewish people's attachment through the
  millenia to its eternal homeland. Rather, Kushner makes a point
  of elevating the moral stature of the Islamofascists who have
  unhesitatingly and unceasingly for a century prosecuted a
  campaign of genocidal slaughter against any and all Jews who
  sought to reclaim their stolen patrimony (through aboveboard
  land-purchase and settlement, prior to wars of justifiable
  self-defense). Like his evil Arab idols, Kushner cannot abide the
  concept of a restored Jewish commonwealth, secured on a
  foundation of existential legitimacy, political independence, and
  territorial sovereignty. Zionism, and its morally necessary
  outcome the State of Israel, enabled and is continuing to enable
  the very effloresence of Jewish culture in the US in the
  post-1948 and certainly post-1967 vineyards where the Klezmatics
  have been frolicking and where Kushner has gained his fame and
  fortune. But Kushner hates the very thought of being liberated,
  and seeks to sow that hatred throughout world Jewry. The
  Klezmatics should feel ashamed for linking themselves to this
  cruel purveyor of assisted suicide.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">"A provocative and surprising thriller."
  (Fangoria) Yeah it is surprising, surprising-ly bad. It's also
  provocative, it provoked me to write this bad review. From the
  beginning I could tell the director, Chris Fisher, was attempting
  to create a stylistic film. However, after the third pointless
  scene of swirling overlapping shots and panning camera work I
  gave up. If you're using style, have a reason. Style without
  reason is not style. This film is one thing, if nothing else, a
  great lesson in how to over use overlapping shots (also known as
  crossdisolving shots). Drink too much and spin around for 10
  seconds and you'll get the same effect as the camera work/editing
  of the film. There's so much overlapping shots in this film,
  there's probably 2 1/2 hours of footage on the screen in the 85
  minutes that the film is. It's full of tallent, bad tallent. It's
  more about naked women, sex, and drugs than the actual story. I
  expected a cheap nock-off of The Life of David Gale. I would have
  enjoyed that 100 times more that this. This is bad, annoyingly
  bad. Some moron wanted to make a film and got all hung up
  editing. Annette Davey, the editor, should have her name removed
  from the film. Unless, for some unknown reason, she's proud of
  her work. If I was studio head at Silver Nitrate Entertainment
  and somone presented me the final cut of this film, I'd have
  everyone and anyone associated with it fired, immediately without
  question. Sony Pictures Home Entertainment made a mistake with
  the distribution of this film. If you enjoy good movies and great
  camera work, STAY AWAY from this film</Text>

  <Text category="music">Released by Atlantic five years after it
  appeared in Australia, presumably to meet high demand for AC/DC's
  music, this international version of "DIRTY DEEDS DONE DIRT
  CHEAP" is a farce. Once again, somebody had the rather strange
  ideas of altering the song sequence, and replacing both "R.I.P.
  (rock in peace)" and "Jailbreak", two of the strongest numbers in
  the album's Aussie version, with T.N.T.'s "Rocker" and "Love at
  first feel", an OK, if not spectacular song. Ah, and "Problem
  child", already featured in Atlantic's version of "Let there be
  rock", is also included in here. The same song in two different
  "official albums". Marvelous!. Oh yeah, and somebody hired
  HIPGNOSIS in order to re-design the front and back covers. That
  was a cute detail, but the Aussie version's covers (classic mid
  70's cartoonish artwork) are far more appealing. Who's to blame
  for this rip off?. Somebody at Atlantic Records?. Some members of
  AC/DC?. Maybe both?. Who cares anyway?. Once again, now that I've
  got used to the Aussie album, listening back to this "product"
  feels worse than a hangover from consuming adulterated, low
  quality spirits. Every enthusiastic record collector knows that
  both Warner Music and Sony Music are serious labels that took,
  and still take risks, by signing up cutting edge artists and by
  respecting their will. So, it seems that, with their approval of
  this re-issue, the surviving members of AC/DC are the ones to
  blame for this farce to go on, and on, and on ... If this is so
  ... well ... guys, we, the fans made you filthy rich. We deserve
  the "real deal", available worldwide, at a "reasonable price". I
  only give this "product" a 2 star rating, just because "Love at
  first feel" remains unreleased in Australia. How unusual!. A
  final word about this re-issue: I don't own it. In the words of
  Pete Townshend, I "won't get fooled again". In order to get bonus
  material, you must go through an irritatingly cumbersome Internet
  gimmick. If Bon Scott (undisputedly the band's most
  uncompromising member ever), was still alive, I believe things
  would be different. By the way, if you are interested in the real
  stuff, please be so kind as to read my review of "DIRTY DEEDS
  DONE DIRT CHEAP" (Import). OTHER ITEMS TO BE AVOIDED: The skimpy
  "retrospective" EP "'74 JAIBREAK", and "BONFIRE", a rather steep
  box set in which at least 6 songs are repeated twice, in
  different versions. None of these titles include all the songs
  left out by the adulteration of AC/DC's first four Aussie

  <Text category="book">When I first picked up Drinking Coffee
  Elsewhere, I was excited to have the chance to read something
  that so many people seemed to enjoy. And, truthfully, it's not a
  horrible book. It is entertaining, the style works, etc. On that
  note, if you're looking for a fun read and don't plan on thinking
  about it too much, then by all means, get it. My problem with the
  book is that it doesn't deserve all the acclaim it's getting-- if
  you want something that breaks boundaries or adds a new voice to
  the current socio-political situation of America, this is not
  your book. Probably one of the major problems with the collection
  is that it's heralded as a riveting commentary on the plight of
  the African American female. Packer has very little new to say,
  and most of the underlying themes of the stories have not only
  been said previously by Alice Walker and other writers, but have
  also have been said better by those authors. Drinking Coffee
  Elsewhere is no more than a watered down version of You Can't
  Keep a Good Woman Down, a book that, while having its own
  problems, would probably be a better use of your time and money
  if you're really interested in the social commentary in the text.
  Even from the literary standpoint, it's not terribly outstanding.
  The characters are stereotypes; the plots are predictable. The
  adult female protagonists are all essentially the same person--
  an intelligent outsider who struggles with race, religion, and
  fitting in-- and are generally pretty ornery about it as they do
  so. The other protagonists are the same, just not so irritable.
  Similar to this lack of variation in her characters, Packer
  varies little in her narrative style. Yes, the language is pretty
  at times, but there is no experimentation with language or
  structure; all of the writing is in a highly generic voice.
  Finally, the stories themselves contain scenes that aren't
  necessary and that detract from the actual narrative. In short,
  Drinking Coffee Elsewhere proves that what it takes to sell a lot
  of books isn't actual talent, but how much your publisher backs
  you. Packer had the good fortune to have famous mentors and to be
  the product of some highly acclaimed writing programs, which
  resulted in her being picked up by a big name publisher who could
  pay to get her name out</Text>
  <Text category="book">I have no personal experience with 12-step
  programs nor do I have dominant addictions (other than book and
  DVD buying!) but I am a psychologist who has seen a lot of people
  and their stories and regularly deals with smoking, over-eating
  and love addictions in particular. I was hoping for some new
  ideas to assist clients. This book takes a rational-emotive type
  approach to conquering addiction and on that level is fine for
  those wanting to look at that approach. I also found some of his
  reference to research of how people recover also quite useful BUT
  he seems to have quite a personal, and often over-generalised,
  attacking crusade against 12-step programs. Some of his concerns
  about possible problems and misunderstandings many people can
  have with 12-step programs were valid and useful. Similarly I
  welcomed his questioning of the disease model that has people
  always defining themselves as an addict and powerless. However he
  has to keep coming back in every chapter to go over and over the
  evils he sees in 12-step programs - and in very derogatory
  judgmental language. He often even implies they are all
  deliberately manipulating and exploiting people. I got very
  uncomfortable with his imputing these motives to everyone. There
  appear to be many genuine people of good intention in these
  movements (and many who clearly seems to get a lot out of them
  and have recovered). I would have rather he had used his own
  rational methods rather than resort to such abusive language. He
  could have suggested modified views and tools, and alternatives
  to consider. I can't imagine that he would lure anyone away from
  the 12-step programs he criticises by attacking everything they
  have been standing for. However a gentler exploration of
  limitations and evidence and suggestions for alternatives may
  have opened up a welcomed middle ground</Text>

  are very few shots of Ryan that last more than 10 seconds at a
  time. Her dialogue is kept short and simple, and when she does
  have more than 3 lines at once, the complete lack of feeling,
  expression &amp;amp; emotion in her voice makes you consider
  turning off the movie and doing something worthwhile, like
  cleaning out the fridge or picking at your hang-nails. That is

  <Text category="dvd">In this sixth (but not final) installment of
  the movie series, what we get is little story and too much
  senseless action (with a sprinkling of hot tub sex). This is a
  very disappointing film. Although it is the last such LWnC movie
  from this creative team, it does not end the storyline (with 28
  volumes in the manga series, we probably would have needed
  another 3-7 films). So the patient, constant viewer gets instead
  a hack-and-slash film of mid-caliber. The ending -- an
  over-extending action sequence set on a snowy slope -- is very
  unsatisfying; so are the characters: unlike other LWnC films, we
  do not get to meet any new incidental characters. As a result,
  the film is less about "Edo" soceity (which one cannot argue is
  the secondary if not primary goal of the manga team) and instead
  just a big showdown waiting to happen...waiting, waiting to
  happen. The film is way too long and its pacing is horrible. I
  think the fault with the film lies in these two things: 1) the
  writers/filmmakers chose poor source material. The "five wheel"
  assassin team denies Itto and son the chance to mingle with
  regular Edo joes. As a result, you do not get as I argued the
  best part of the series: the rich detail of Edo life. 2) the
  filmmakers must have been overwhelmed with James Bond films like
  "On Her Majesty's Secret Service" and whatnot with their decision
  to make this movie "samurai on skis". After the first few minutes
  of fighting on the snow, I was thinking "Enough already, I get

  <Text category="health">This dryer made my wavy hair straighter than a
  seperate brush and dryer ever could. THe problem is that it just
  shuts off. The first time I used it, it shut off twice within a
  20-minute period. It wouldn't restart when I plugged it back in,
  or even when I tried a different outlet. No matter what I tried,
  it wouldn't restart for about 5 minutes. I've used an older model
  of this dryer and the same thing happened. I wouldn't recommend
  buying this product</Text>
  <Text category="health">To get hot lather, which is nice, you first
  have to get the device installed on top the can. I would not
  recommend this if you are easily frustrated. The directions
  provided are sparse in several languages. First you have to pry
  the top off the can of shaving cream. They provide a pry tool for
  that purpose which works well on some brands of shaving cream
  better than others. Then you have to fit the device on top the
  can. It worked well with one brand in a large size can. When I
  tried it with a smaller size can of shaving cream it emptied half
  the can during the installation process. Using a different brand
  in a large can, I had trouble prying the top off the can. If you
  have time and patience, and are willing to spend some money on
  various brands of shaving cream to find one that works well, give
  it a try. Otherwise, be forewarned it may lead to frustration and
  bad language. It would be nice if companies intending to sell
  products in the US (apparently manufactured somewhere in Asia)
  would provide a clear set of instuctions in English, in
  reasonable large readable type, with illustrations. In this case,
  they need to clearly specify the type shaving cream can the unit
  is designed for. I do not need instructions in foreign languages,
  and get tired of limited instructions in six languages</Text>
  <Text category="music">Imagine buying this CD after seeing "The
  Mirror has Two Faces" fully expecting the SOUNDTRACK music to the
  movie, and reading overall great reviews on Amazon. Imagine the
  shock of receiving the CD and the surprise of hearing 20 brief
  cuts of plain instrumental music out of the 24 cuts - The
  remaining 4 cuts contained very short lines of verse. Perhaps
  Barbara, with her tremendous unlimited wealth, felt she would be
  giving away a "free album" to the masses if the soundtrack

  <Text category="book">I started reading this immediately after the
  last REH compilation and there could not be a greater difference
  in story telling. While REH was first and foremost a story
  teller, Pressfield uses one of the absolute worst devices in his
  recount of a grandson of his grandfather's remembering his
  conversations with a client who knew the famous Alcibiades. This,
  as previous reviewers have mentioned, creates a large gap between
  reader and story. But why do this? Why use such a crappy method
  of story telling? I guess it pads the book with unnecessary
  dialogue. All in all, it's a slow, uninspired, day dream story.
  So crappy that I felt it necessary to write this review echoing
  previous harsh reviews. I want my money back</Text>

  convince every parent to withhold from purchasing these dvds

  <Text category="music">Following 2002's self-produced and underrated
  Under Rug Swept, Morissette returns in 2004 with So-Called Chaos.
  With this release, Morissette has done a complete makeover of her
  look with a serious haircut and sporting a look of casual glamour
  like she's aspiring to take Hollywood by strom but isn't 100%
  sure. Maybe the new look and image might have worked if
  Morissette's makeover in sound was good enough to go with it-but
  it's not. This CD starts out good with the opening cut "Eight
  Easy Steps," a fast-paced rockin' tune with Alanis at the wheel
  of leadership but also ready to bust her own chops at the same
  moment. "Out is Through" follows and also stands out, but then
  So-Called Chaos begins to turn problematic by not having an edge.
  And Morissette should never have brought John Shanks or Tim
  Thorney(or both)on board for assistance because she was left with
  bland arrangements behind many of the tracks. "Doth I Protest Too
  Much" is without a doubt the worst song Alanis has ever recorded.
  The title song attempts for a gritty and gutsy feel but even that
  attempt becomes overshadowed by Morissette's lyrics(yes, not her
  best work)when she refers to heartburn, headaches, and breached
  contracts as primary results of a chaotic lifestyle. The tracks
  continue with "All of Me," and "This Grudge," both rather dull,
  while the closing track "Everything" was a weak choice for the
  first single. Morissette has always been a progressive artist,
  but So-Called Chaos doesn't measure up to any of its
  predecessors, and may leave many fans longing to see the girl
  with the jagged heart still spinning with her free-flowing locks
  firmly in place.</Text>

  <Text category="music">While the sound of the stream is relaxing and
  well recorded, there are way too many birds around. The CD
  describes their sound as distant and faint, but that's far from
  accurate. The parts of the CD where all you hear is the stream
  alone don't add up to more than 10 minutes, and never last more
  than a minute. For the most part you will hear the stream and
  plenty of birds, rather close and sometimes very loud. Buyer
  beware: the 30 second samples you get here are precisely from the
  parts with no birds at all! Very misleading</Text>
  <Text category="health">Although I am definitely on the 'Sonicare'
  bandwagon in so far as this product's ability to clean my
  teeth--it does a great job--this model brush is made quite
  poorly. The battery compartment (the e3000 uses 'AA' batteries)
  on mine, regardless of it having an o-ring on the door, seems to
  be continually wet inside, with the negative (-) terminal on one
  of the AA-cells rusting after only two weeks use. Philips
  acknowledges this is a problem but offers no solution. Also,
  there are many small crevices in/around the nameplate on the
  side, and a large gap under the nut for the brush-head that
  accumulates 'gook' on a daily basis. Philips advises that this is
  probably 'mold' and the brush should be 'disassembled and
  air-dried' after every use. It takes longer to do this than to
  brush my teeth-- Again, while this is probably one of the best
  ways to clean your teeth at this point in time, and an economical
  way to try one of the products that normally start out at $64e
  (and up), there is no reason why the e3000 shouldn't be made as
  well as the better units, or hold up to water/daily use as well
  as some of the $9 Crest electrics we commonly see</Text>
  <Text category="book">First let it be said that this book leads you
  to believe that he hikes the whole trail... He does not. He hikes
  less than a third. You dont find this out until 2/3 through the

  to an ill effort to fulfill a contract. My conclusion on this
  book is that he was contracted to hike the trail by his
  publisher, could not, and stuffed the remainder of the book with
  verbatum history lessions and whole cloth inserts of useless
  statistics. As others have said in this review forum. This book
  can be snide, highschoolish and down right mean. I fail to see
  the "wit" in his endless negitivity and bashing. This book has a
  few funny parts, but I cant help but feel that it is a huge
  exageration of real events, and is mostly contrived fictional
  accounts which he uses to air is nasty comments. It is so

  <Text category="music">I bought this cd after hearing Tony on one of
  the am morning shows, and really likings some of his past
  offerings, but I have to say that this cd was the pits and a
  waste of my money. I was ticked off to have bought this cd from a
  talented brother and not have gotten my money's worth. Tony has
  been on the scene for quite a number of years, and I expected a
  more mature offering from him than this latest. There is a great
  lack of maturity on this cd, and it's an overall disappointment.
  Unfortunately, I have to say here that Toney is not alone. What
  on earth possessed veteran soul singers the O'Jays to sing a song
  like Let's Ride? Who are they singing about girls their
  granddaughters ages? Hoochie mommas? What? Babyface? Even he gets
  in on the foolishness of trying to sing like the hip hop crowd!
  And what's up with the explicit lyrics? We all know you can curse
  like sailors, but why is this language necessary in music? And I
  know that artist have always performed their music, but will
  someone tell me why it's necessary to perform with so few clothes
  on? I would rather hear your music, not see your booty! Sorry,
  but a review I just read triggered me, and I'd been thinking
  about the Tony Terry cd for a while. Hope he comes up with a more
  mature offering the next time. Meanwhile I think you're safe in

  <Text category="book">Perfectly in keeping with the imperialist
  ethos that he so proudly and loudly espouses, Boot has foisted
  upon us a book that rests entirely on the labors of others.
  Lacking even the slightest trace of shame, he plunders concepts
  and ideas from anyplace in the intellisphere he chooses. As a
  result, there's nary a new thought nor insight to be found
  anywhere within these pages. Even more pitiably, like a renegade
  third world nuclear scientist trying to "sanitize" his
  clandestinely-acquired apparatus of any markings that might
  possibly identify its source, Boot assiduously scrubs away any
  subtleties and nuance that the original thoughts may have
  possessed. One wearies quickly of the Manichaean results. And
  like any ideologically-driven but technically inept would-be
  nuclear (or social) engineer, he fails utterly in his attempt to
  enrich his raw material even minimally, succeeding only in
  rendering it more toxic and hazardous than it originally was.
  Why, even the title itself has been purloined from Alistair
  Home's 1977 underground classic, "A Savage War of Peace"!*
  Considering that Home's tome arrives at essentially the opposite
  conclusions from Boot's, this is irony most profound. It is
  scarcely surprising, then, that recent history has thoroughly
  discredited the philosophies and policies so ear-splittingly
  trumpeted in Boot's book, thus rendering moot any lingering
  interest one might have had in perusing it -- unless one wishes
  to take counsel for the future by ruminating upon the Ozymandian
  ruins of Boot's espoused belief system. * Recently reprinted and
  highly recommended!</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">While the story may be entertaining in its own
  right, and ANY chance to see Donald O'Conner dance is worth it,
  this can be a very disappointing film to Porter buffs. The plot
  has nothing to do with the stage play except that some of it does
  take place on a ship. The story line is totally different and
  therefore some of Porter's original songs have been taken out and
  replaced by songs of Sammy Cahn and James Van Huesen which do not
  live up to Porter's quality. The best examples I can give is the
  fact that there is no Evangelist so the title song "Anything
  Goes" turns into a second act number, sung by Mitzi and chorus
  (with horrific word changes) and "Blow Gabriel Blow" becomes a
  finale in the broadway show (sung by the four main characters)
  that comes at the end of the picture and has nothing to do with
  any character or plot line. If you haven't seen it on stage it's
  pleasant enough, but if you're expecting the broadway show it's a
  major disappointment</Text>

  kitchen for imaginative play. Bullpies, I say. I have tons of
  dollar-store food. I have ultra-realistic foam food from a
  kitchen set I got. I prefer the dollar store food. Dollar store
  food is better because it has more in one package, looks real, is
  cheap, pretty durable, and looks nice. I have a really silly play
  food set that came with a stovetop (small, but the knobs turn!),
  a pink and purple propane tank, a can of "barracuda" (seriously),
  and a can of "barracuda hash" which included barracuda, ham and
  eggs, chicken, turkey, potpie, and more eggs. But the logo has
  spam and a hotdog, and the front of it has beans, turkey, fish,
  sausage, and lots of weird meat. But it says "Eatable, 100%
  dainty, Present!, Daintiness, Dainty". Just wanted to let you
  know. So, bottom line is, dollar store play food is much better
  than you think it is. It comes with lots of things that the
  expensive companies would never have dreamed of</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My daughter's birthday was to take place the

  actually sing happy birthday the next morning to my 2 year old! I
  installed the software on my desktop (XP machine), but the real
  headache came when I hooked this thing to the computer (and I am
  a computer guy, so it shouldn't be that hard). I plugged in the
  doll with the USB provided cable, and Windows XP loaded the

  this on a new computer, I loaded this software on my laptop.
  Hooked the doll in. Had Windows XP update the USB driver. Then

  <Text category="dvd">Melanie Griffith, Rachel Leigh Cook, and Hugh
  Dancy star in this straight-to-video film about one female
  transporter, who gets into trouble because of someone plotting
  against her. Well, that's all about it, apparently, but the film
  tries to give something unique to the otherwise unoriginal plot.
  I mean, the slightly original character of Sarah by Melanie
  Griffth, who plays that smuggler in trouble. Given a special job
  by Malcom McDowell with his customary 'I-could-be-very-baaaad'
  smile, Sarah agrees to carry a pack hidden in her bag. But as you
  know, someone also wants that package, and ... well, that's
  nothing new, but she is attacked on the way. DON'T EXPECT ANY
  THRILLER, however. The film's focus is not about that; it is the
  relations about Sarah and Jack (Dancy) who live together in a
  fancy Paris apartment. But while Sarah is away from Paris on
  business, Jack is attracted to a younger lady Jenny (Cook) who
  also falls for him. Thus the film makes an effort to include both
  love and crime. Nice try, considering this interesting point
  about the character of elder lady Sarah, but if the factor is
  taken away from the film, the end result is nothing but a flat,
  tired suspence -- suspence as to its relations and its crimes
  alike. Either way, the film is emotilnally very void. OK. two
  fatally bad things: one, too incredible characters. See, Sarah is
  a professional courier who must know the rules of the job, which
  could be dangerous. But instead of renting a car (and it's
  Europe, where that could be pretty easy), she takes a train (and
  a night train!) in which she becomes an easy target. In this way,
  the film misses every chance to make it more suspenceful. When
  some character(s) must die, they die like characters in old video
  games -- they fall, that's all. The other one; acting. Let me be
  honest. It was painful to watch the one-dimentional performance
  of Melanie Griffith, who was very good in 'Another Day in
  Paradise.' Maybe she is not the greatest actor, but certainly she
  can act. But as far as 'Tempo' is concerned, no, I don't think
  so. Only the location of Paris saves this film from utter
  forgettableness. Forget about this one.</Text>
  <Text category="book">Other reviewers have taken pains to outline
  the "plot" of this baby boomer bodice ripper. Suffice it to say
  author Kathryn Harrison, scrupulously adhering to some private
  conviction that "more is better" , offers estrangement between
  identical twins, loss of a child, incest, paternity confusion,
  mid-life crisis and spiteful erotomania as it crops up in the
  life of one understandably confused New York shrink. This reader
  was aching for the hero, Will, to book himself onto Jerry
  Springer while feeling immensely shortchanged by lines from Ms
  Harrison like "It's just...it's...What is it? Will doesn't have a
  word for what he feels." (Perhaps the character lacks the
  emotional vocabulary to communicate with the reader: the author,
  however, should not. In any case, those are lousy, lazy sentences
  among so many examples.) In addition to being insufferably,
  cartoonishly silly, the book is wounded by a dreary internal
  structure. Bad things happen to Will-the-shrink, Will then
  regurgitates them at length to HIS shrink, then buttonholes his
  wife to regurgitate what happened, what he thinks happened, and
  what he thinks about what his shrink thinks. As for Ms Harrsion's
  "famous" sex scenes. They practically lie on their backs,
  fondling their adverbs and panting for Penthouse approval: "She's
  unbelievably wet and tight and impossibly, almost unnaturally,
  slippery." "Envy", by the way, is Ms Harrison's 11th book and she
  should, by now, be getting things more right than wrong</Text>

  <Text category="book">I thoroughly enjoyed the author's earlier work
  on how the Irish saved civilization. But this book was a
  disappointing compendium of Greek myths, legends and history that
  never reveals a plan behind the book. Taken in its subparts, many
  sections are engagingly informative in an elegant if sometimes
  pretentious prose. Yet the author ambles from here to there in a
  disjointed narrative with interesting nuggets but little insight.
  Where's the big picture? The author attempts to wrap it up at the
  end with a sentence about the Greeks' "variety of human response,
  lightening quick transmutations, resourcefulness, and
  inexhaustible creativity." A subtitle like "A Greek Treasury of
  Personal Vignettes" might have been more descriptive and merited
  another star. But it falls short as a "hinge of history" with
  impoverished and even maladaptive connections (FDR as Solon -
  really?) to the modern world. I am sorry to not recommend
  it.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Agree that it was beautifully filmed, but....
  there must have been a great deal lost in the translation</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Francisco was right, this film is about as
  well-conceived as buttcrust. The review on the back of the dvd
  says "jaw dropping, " but the full quote probably reads "jaw
  dropping (because i was lulled to sleep like a baby)". There is
  about 30 seconds of truly jaw dropping footage, in the zombie
  attack scenes, but these scenes only account for maybe 5 minutes
  of the movie. The rest of this film consists of the ear-bleeding
  whines and yawn-inducing infighting of the human characters,
  ill-conceived and extremely unlikable caricatures of a
  pseudo-cynical and extremely redundant "evil side of human
  nature" message that would be better left to Jean Renoir (or even
  Adam Sandler considering the results here). I don't watch zombie
  movies for the characters, especially characters so vapid and
  unengaging. It seemed like the script writer read a novice's How
  To pamphlet and said "yeah, it needs some CONFLICT". If these
  characters weren't so constipated and bloated I'd give them a
  chance. One Amazon reviewer tries to justify all of the
  one-dimensional absurdity by crowning it with the weighty title
  of "social commentary," but that's just a mindless knee-jerk
  observation that fails to ascertain whether it was carried out
  sucessfully. It wasn't. You'd get more insight watching a kid
  frying ants with a magnifying glass. The critical ambitions of
  this movie are ill-fitting and embarassing, and ultimately just
  plain disappointing since they allot almost no time to showcase
  the director's real talent, which is (you guessed it) the lovely
  undead. The rest is monotonous dreck. I don't know why horror
  directors have so much insecurity about the worth of their
  strengths that they feel they need to shroud them in a poor man's
  dramatic rags. All that aside, the ending is the worst
  anticlimatic cop-out in the history of horror movies. A horror
  movie that sucks for 3/4 of its duration needs a cool climax to
  redeem itself, but the cut-away at the end makes you wanna kick
  the director in the gonads. Sorry, but anyone who calls this a
  classic is a friggin soundbite-repeating moron.</Text>
  <Text category="book">I really didn't enjoy this book. I am half
  Italian-American, and I've read a few books about growing up in
  an Italian-American family in an effort to learn about my roots.
  I have also read several books about 2nd generation Americans
  struggling to find their identities while caught between what is
  &amp;amp;quot;normal&amp;amp;quot; and their immigrant parents. I
  normally enjoy such books, but not this one. I know that life
  wasn't always a bowl of cherries for these familes, but this book
  makes it seem as if it was absolutely horrible. Yet, I couldn't
  find anything about the daughters' lives that are really that bad
  or even different from many people's lives in this country. Where
  is all the anger coming from? I really don't know. This book is
  dark and depressing. Some say it is funny at times, but I didn't

  why. Wack MC: MF Doom is a bad rapper, not the worst, just bad.
  He can flow but his rymes are weak, corny, and somtimes it doesnt
  make sense at all. The corniest ryme I heard was- "We rock the
  house like rock 'n roll/ got more soul Than a sock with a hole."
  LMAO! It gets worse "Take it from the Tec-9 holder/ They bit and
  dont know they neck shine from shinola" What is he talking
  about??? He is not a genius MC, Nas is, he is even worse than
  Aesop Rock. Which they rap with words and dont even make any
  sense. Filler: This Cd has too much filler, they have like 10
  songs that last only 50 secs. Some of them is not even neccasary.
  Average Beats: The beats are either average or just sucks. I can
  make better beats on Fruity Loops. However Track 22 "Rhinestone
  Cowboy" had the best beat on the entire album. The beat was hot
  to tell you the truth, but that only gives it one star. Overall
  this album sucks, just download "Rhinestone Cowboy" and call it a
  day. I think Madlib can make good beats its just that he didnt
  show it here. I dont recommend this album, if you want a good
  album get Mos Def "Black on Both Sides" It 10x better than

  <Text category="health">I am an African American woman with long,
  chemically relaxed hair. As a full-time undergraduate student, I
  cannot afford to visit the salon on a weekly basis. I purchased
  this flat iron on a whim at the market because my previous flat
  iron had recently shorted out (it was an older model with no
  swivel cord). I chose this flat iron because it was the same
  brand as my last one, and I was overwhelmingly satisfied with its
  performance. I cannot say the same for this product. In
  retrospect, it does exactly what it claims to do, but nothing
  beyond that. With my previous flat iron, I could straighten and
  style my layered hair at the same time, which significantly cut
  the amount of heat and damage my hair had to endure. Any attempts
  to style my hair were underwhelming to say the least. After using
  the flat iron, my hair looked fizzy and unkempt, and even a bit
  damaged. Any curls I managed to produce looked undefined and
  limp. It was by chance that I purchased a curling iron in
  addition to the flat iron, and was able to successfully style my
  hair after wrapping my hair overnight and applying frizz control
  serum. Needless to say, you won't be able to produce that "fresh
  from the salon" look with this flat iron, which is sadly exactly
  what I needed. I do not feel confident about my hair when
  stepping out of the house after using this product. If you don't
  use this tool for anything but sleek, straight looks and have a
  bottle of frizz serum handy, then this is a great product for
  you. While I am not happy with its results, it will have to do
  for now. I'll be saving for a better iron while praying that
  straightening AND curling my hair doesn't leave it severely
  damaged.</Text>

  <Text category="book">I read Bill Bryson's "A Walk in the Woods" and
  laughed hysterically at many parts of the book, and through the
  rest was either duly entertained or pleasantly educated (for the
  "educated" aspect, Bill interlaces the book with fascinating
  factual tangents). I started into "In a Sunburned Country" with
  similar expectations, and especially since I have always longed
  and planned to visit Australia. To state that I was disappointed
  is a severe understatement. After reading this book I now have
  little to no desire to visit the "land down under;" my only hope
  is that I will completely forget what I read in Bryson's book so
  that I may one day look forward to and enjoy visiting Australia.
  (Senility be merciful and consume me hastily!) My best estimate
  is that Bryson was commissioned to write a ~350 page book about
  Australia. During and / or after his trip, his creative sense
  must have taken a vacation of its own. I have rarely struggled so
  much to get through a book as I did with this one. Bryson even
  stooped so low as to use an urban legend as a "story" relayed
  second-hand from one of the Australians he "met." Such a stunt
  makes me question if any of his accounts are real in any of his
  books. The only saving grace to this book was the educational
  tangents. These, at least, provided for some interesting reading.
  After comparing notes with another person who ventured to read
  another of Bryson's books ("I'm A Stranger Here Myself") after
  she read "A Walk in the Woods," it would appear that "In a
  Sunburned Country" is not the only snore-fest that Bryson has
  churned out. Perhaps he isn't a "one hit wonder," but I for one
  am not going to waste my time or money finding out. So, if you
  are looking for the same caliber of writing that Bryson provided
  in "A Walk in the Woods," look to another author or prepare to be
  greatly disappointed.</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">this is a ridiculous overkill of two
  fascinating characters in the 'lonesome dove'. the whole 2 dvds
  were just a bunch of idiots kept blabbering, small talking,
  yammering, blah, blah, blah from the first second to the last
  minute, just like mcmurty's novels, all the characters were just
  kept talking, talking, talking in meaningless small talks, almost
  talked your ears off. it's so controversial and contradictory to
  those two characters first appeared in 'lonesome dove', gus
  talked and talked, but call never talked like what was protrayed
  in this pathetic 'dead man's walk' and the 'comanchi moon', the
  more logic one is the real sequel, 'the street of loredo', at
  least gus was dead, and call remained not just silent but more
  quiet. by watching this horrible movie adaptation from the
  original book, scripted by the author, the whole movie was doomed
  to be horrible. because mcmurty simply couldn't omitted those
  yammering spread all over his original novel, page after page,
  blah, blah, blah, and we have to find the storyline among those
  conversations, dialogs, and dug them out of those garbage-like
  paragraphs. watching this movie was no different. those idiotic
  morons never kept their mouths shut. blabbering day and night,
  even during the comanchi attacks. what call showed in this movie
  and the novel could never developed into a character like what he
  had become in 'lonesome dove'. because from the very beginning,
  everybody just quacked and quacked like a school of chickens.
  drive me nuts. how come these two young characters portrayed in
  this blabbering novel would and could have developed into the
  profound older characters in the 'lonesome dove'? once a moron, a
  coward, an idiot, always would be a one, no matter how old you
  have become. adding experiences and sophistication in the aging
  process never happened to a moron, coward or an idiot. how could
  these two jokes would have survived in that harsh environment is
  simply beyond me. at least the 'lonesome dove' movie adaptation
  was close to what the novel read like. and 'the street of loredo'

  <Text category="book">Dr. Hawkins first book, Power vs Force was
  interesting and presented a useful way to dowse using
  kinesiology. However, he began to venture into misapplication of
  this method, and has now gone off on a tangent where he seems to
  wish to delude himself into thinking he has developed a
  fool-proof way to judge the level of consciousness of any entity,
  concept, or construct and the truth or falsehood of any
  statement. There are serious logical, philosophical, and
  practical flaws in his work, and his attempt to quantify matters
  that aren't quantifiable leads to meaningless data that probably
  matches the bias &amp;amp; beliefs of those carrying out the
  muscle tests. This book is a good example to present to show how
  people can deceive themselves and misuse muscle testing and
  dowsing techniques. The actual technique is worthwhile, but much
  of what Hawkins presents in the book is utterly meaningless and
  invalid. The levels of awareness that can be tapped into with
  dowsing are wise enough to NOT let us ask just anything we wish
  to and be able to receive accurate, valid answers. Hawkins
  explores issues about media, politics, religion, spirituality,
  history, philosophies, healing arts, entertainment, and more, and
  reveals his own gross ignorance on many matters. He seems unaware
  that many of the people he trusts in politics and media are
  professional gangsters, liars, and two-faced sociopaths. He has a
  negative view of conspiracy theorists, many of whom are genuinely
  determined to find the truth and don't resort to Hawkins'
  misguided shortcut attempt to identify truth. Hawkins also
  fosters confusion with his description of his muscle test method,
  as it really has little to do with applied kinesiology, but is a
  form of dowsing where the muscle is directed to remain weak or
  strong in lieu of muscle response moving a pendulum or rod. I
  hope Hawkins gets to reconsider his current
  efforts...consciousness and spiritual research are vital
  endeavors and there are others doing useful, responsible work in
  those areas. For now I'd encourage Hawkins to recognize that 911
  was in part an inside job, many conservative politicians and
  pundits are corrupt frauds, and the overall maturity of
  consciousness in America is not greater than the rest of the
  world</Text>

  <Text category="music">I live in Buffalo and I'm a big prog rock fan;
  so when I saw this CD at the library, I knew I had to give it a
  free listen. But make no mistake - this CD under-delivers on many
  levels. I always wanted Asia to be a great band - it had my
  favorite guitar player (Steve Howe), a top-shelf drummer (Carl
  Palmer), and a proven bass player/vocalist who was up to the task
  (John Wetton). But there was always a bit too much "pop",
  simplicity and repetition in their music to totally engage me.
  Hey, progressive rock is mostly about "different", complexity and
  change, right? Asia was a progressive-pop band (akin to the later
  albums of Todd Rundgren's Utopia) that made good music, but
  didn't really pioneer much of anything. Same with this CD.
  There's little here that's new or better than the studio versions
  of the songs. Palmer's long drum solo got boring after a while.
  Steve's acoustic solos can be found on other Yes recordings, and
  done much better there - here, the recording quality is so bad
  that it sounds like he's playing tuned rubber bands at times.
  (Honestly, I remember hearing better fidelity from my old Kenner
  Close'n'Play!) O.K., it WAS cool to hear Steve express his
  pleasure at playing in Buffalo again! But the so-called "keyboard
  solo" by Geoff Downs was underwhelming to say the least, and
  reinforced my suspicion that he was sort of the weak link in this
  group of otherwise great prog virtuosos. I guess if one loves a
  band too much, they can blindly overlook some shortcomings on
  almost any CD by that band, and that's just fine for those
  people. However, the OBJECTIVE reality of this CD's value comes
  creeping in on many other's existing reviews: namely, the
  production quality is sub-par (to the point of being annoying at
  times); the vocals and harmonies are often off-key (you really
  shouldn't have to wince this much during 79 minutes of music!);
  this is clearly a single disk album that was issued on 2 disks
  for some reason; the packaging and liner notes are scant; and the
  performance just doesn't add much to the studio versions. This is
  for Asia completists only. Asia did make a solid 5-star
  progressive-pop CD with their first studio album. I love it. But
  they never improved upon it, and never stretched out into new
  territory. Perhaps this 1982 live recording exposes some of the
  weaknesses that kept this potential supergroup from going from
  "good" to "great". Support your local library. (And in this case,
  save some cash!)</Text>

  <Text category="book">Mark Twain once said that (and I
  paraphrase)the definition of a classic is something that everyone
  wants to have read and no one wants to read. That is my
  experience with this book. For some reason, A Tale of Two Cities
  never made it onto any of my high school reading lists, and I
  figured it was one of those books I should have under my belt. So
  I picked it up. What a slog! A book that might have been
  fascinating due to its French Revolution subject matter was a
  mass of rambling descriptions and melodrama. We were supposed to
  shed tears for Sidney Carton, a character who you barely get to
  know, and root for Lucie Manette...the highly unrealistic paragon
  of unspoiled goodness. The only thing I liked about this book was
  how Madame Defarge knitted a list of people on which she planned
  to take revenge. An admittedly cool concept. Maybe this book
  speaks to another era, maybe it's past its prime, maybe I don't
  have the required literary sensibilities, or maybe I couldn't
  relate, but A Tale of Two Cities bored me to tears.</Text>
  <Text category="book">As a fan of Gitlin, I was hoping that he'd
  give me the bottom line - his bottom line - on the air we breathe
  today, the same way that brave souls such as Lasch, Marcuse, and
  Bell have done. But Gitlin isn't brave. He admits, honestly, up
  front, that he will reach few conclusions, and merely wants to
  lay out what we face each day on the streets, on TV, and on the
  net. What follows is a stream-of-consciousness depiction of life
  today. I want more than that from Gitlin. I want his conclusions,
  not some lame statement that he hasn't reached any yet. He's not
  getting any younger. Lots of other fabulous thinkers have failed
  at this stage of their lives. It's time for his masterpiece - the
  next book, perhaps</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">You know, I actually enjoyed the first Mummy.
  It was funny, the idea, not often seen in modern films, was good,
  and the characters were each, in their own way, entertaining to
  watch. Why, God, why did they have to go and make a sequel? I
  don't understand. Was it for the money??? I'm not sure when
  exactly I began to hate this; maybe it was somewhere in between
  the horrible and almost nonexistent plotline and the stupidity of
  the main characters making the same mistake AGAIN. Really, you'd
  think after the first time they accidentally woke a mummy from
  it's thousand-year rest they'd learn their lesson. But oh, no;
  the first time wasn't enough. And, also, the whole having a kid
  thing, didn't seem to work. The relationship between the
  characters wasn't the same anymore. I hate it when they do that
  in movies: make sequels and give the once-cool, main characters
  children. Nothing against it, just felt wrong for this movie.
  Throughout most of this movie, I felt stupid, and I don't like
  for things to make me feel that way. I also felt embarrassed to
  have actually paid for my tickets at the theater. Maybe it's just
  me; I just didn't like it. Question of the day for American
  Cinema: What's the deal with being obsessed with sequels?????
  Come on, the first was good enough. You know what the worst thing
  is?-I was actually looking forward to seeing this</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">I saw this movie about two weeks ago and I
  can't believe how disappointed I am for this. I was expecting
  fireworks; instead I got a truckload of bad karma on my head. Not
  only that but it maybe the most over-the-top film I ever saw and
  it will be on my list of the worst movies I ever saw. To begin
  with half of the characters die in this film and I was like 'What
  is the meaning?' then there's the film's signature moment in
  which Sinatra wakes up from his nightmare and they do it in such
  a matter that they put his face right at the camera. Again I said
  to myself, 'What's the point?' And then there's the chilling
  climax which would be totally ripped off a year later by the
  Kennedy assassination-from the scoped rifle right down to James
  Gregory's character getting shot in the head. In one of the
  documentries to this DVD director William Fredkin says that there
  is no doubt this movie caused Lee Harvey Oswald to kill President
  Kennedy because 'Oswald realized that he was Raymond Shaw.' If
  he's right that raises the question: Did he do it by his beliefs
  or did someone push him over? Then Fredkin ends his obseravation
  by saying that the release of "The Manchurian Candidate" and the
  death of President Kennedy are the two events that made the
  1960's what it is and why people today (including me) are still
  obessed with that decade. In conclusion, I think this was a big
  disappoinment. And this movie is on the list of AFI's 100
  greatest films? Please.</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">I have always had a morbid fascination with
  that segment of the population that believes that the Bible is
  the only book one has to read, and that great literature consists
  entirely of the Left Behind series. I bought this movie to get a
  sense of this group. Banal is the kindest word I can find for
  this tripe. Third rate actors, low-rent science fiction
  backdrops, and completely out of touch with reality. The movie
  opens with the Israeli agricultural "miracle." What it does not
  tell the audience is that Israel would be a dead state if it were
  not for the 20% of the Israeli government's budget funded by US
  taxpayers through the US Government's very unwise investment in
  this apartheid regime (see Jimmy Carter's new book) and if it
  were not for the blatant Israeli underground pipes that are
  literally looting the Arab aquifers at long range and from way
  beneath the earth. Israeli agriculture is not a miracle, it is a
  travesty--it consumes 50% of all the water used in Israel, and
  produces less than 5% of the Gross Domestic Product. The movie
  goes downhill from there. Just to place it in a proper religous
  movie context, if the "Ten Commandments" was a perfect 10, this
  movie is no more than a 1 and certainly not even close to a
  2</Text>

  working on the classic car in the garage, or watching football on

  men answer questions about womanly stuff, and women answer
  questions about manly stuff. We have played it twice now, and
  even though the men's team has always had 1 male more in touch

  <Text category="book">The premise put forth in the title is
  supported by some keen insights into "leadership by Calling" and
  comparisons to it with "modern leadership theory." Les Csorba
  writes about the danger of pursuing results without compassion; a
  point with which I agree. Unfortunately, some of the examples he
  chooses are questionable... After warning about the danger of
  weak character in powerful leaders, Csorba chastises German
  Chancellor Schroeder for turning back on some promises to George
  W Bush regarding the war on terrorism and then goes on to deride
  him for his four wives. Meanwhile he praises Jack Welch for going
  from Neutron Jack to a gentler Jack (which Jack says he would
  abandon if needed)while still making the "tough" decisions that
  got the "results" for the shareholders. Jack can change is mind
  and go back to compassionless results... OK. Also, there is no
  mention that Jack was getting results with his personal secretary
  whilst the wife was at home... Unfortunately the theme in
  Csorba's examples becomes one of bashing the mistakes of
  Democrats and forgiving the sins of the Republicans. He does
  sprinkle in some condemnation for a few wrong-minded Republicans
  in a meek attempt at balance. It's a shame that he turned this
  into a politcally tainted work. It started off so well. It
  started off well even though it will turn off readers who are not
  people of faith as faith is central precept to this book. It also
  started off well even though he chose to make George W Bush the
  role model for how to be a trust-able leader. Unfortunately this
  conservative/political bent turned an even harder right from
  there and kept going. It kept going to the point that I could no
  longer plan on sharing this book with some folks I know who
  really need it. They would simply say its a Bush-ie/right-winger
  book and dismiss the valuable and otherwise soundly argued
  premise. Too bad. Csorba almost had a classic instead of a
  politically tainted leadership manual. I say this even though I
  am Republican, am one of the few folks who would admit they were
  voting for Bush BEFORE the election, am a person of faith, and
  tend to find the Dems an easy target. But this book was supposed
  to be about so much more than Republican politics. Too bad</Text>

  very poorly designed. Once you have opened the velcro cavity in
  the dog's tummy, it's nearly impossible to keep it closed again.
  The dog's hairs get caught in the velcro and the battery box is
  too big so the cavity keeps busting open. Now, if I handle the

  sound effects are pretty bad. The sounds quality is poor and it

  where the precious document is : another useless quest. People
  are murdered by the half dozen, the characters are outrageous,

  <Text category="dvd">"The Door In The Floor" is difficult to like,
  even, (or perhaps especially), if you're a fan of John Irving's
  book, "A Widow For One Year," which was the source of this film.
  The movie is dark, depressing, &amp;amp; slow-moving. It also
  showcases the least likable characters from the book. To make
  matters worse, it focuses only on the first third of the novel's
  story, which leaves us with an entire movie about an alienated,
  (&amp;amp; alienating), couple's suffering. The film is
  completely devoid of the novel's interesting &amp;amp; more
  enjoyable journey through this tragic period of a family's life
  &amp;amp; into the more fulfilling chapters in the lives of
  characters who aren't well developed in the film, but who are
  central to the book's satisfying end to an otherwise hopelessly
  sad story! This may give you an idea why the film wasn't very
  successful with audiences. The theme is of deep personal loss and
  the devastating effects it can have on people. Unfortunately, the
  film version of the story concentrates almost entirely on the
  agony experienced by the parents, played by Jeff Bridges
  &amp;amp; Kim Basinger, in the aftermath of the accidental death
  of their two teenage sons. It wallows in the empty chasm that's
  grown between them &amp;amp; delves into the sad, meaningless,
  &amp;amp; even cruel love affairs they each engage in, in vain
  attempts to ease their sorrows &amp;amp; escape the pain of the
  love lost between them &amp;amp; of course, the greatest loss,
  the loss of their sons. The film also highlights the rather ugly
  way this couple inflicts damage upon the people they use for this
  purpose. And finally, we witness the pain of their very young
  daughter, who was born out of yet more of the parent's attempts
  to fill their empty, sad lives, and we're treated to a view of
  her pitiful childhood, growing up with parents who truly "aren't
  there." The greatest mystery for me is why the screenwriter chose
  to tell just a small slice of the story of this great novel, and
  even worse, why they chose to "bring to life" only the most
  depressing and frankly least interesting parts of it! If the
  theme of loss is one you're very interested in, you might find
  this movie quite affecting. As for me, a great fan of the book, I
  can only hope that someday someone makes a better &amp;amp; more
  complete adaptation of this great book. It's not nearly as
  desperate &amp;amp; sad a story as this film version! On
  subsequent viewings I've grown to appreciate this film a bit
  more. Taken completely apart from the novel, it's not a "bad"
  film. Undoubtedly, the performances are wonderful, however little
  fun they are to watch.</Text>

  <Text category="book">This book devotes from 4 to 9 pages to every
  American president. Each individual section includes a brief
  summary of the president's successes and failures while in
  office. The "secrets lives" aspect includes a description of his
  temperament, character and personal habits. For example, John
  Adams is said to have been vain and irritable, while Frankin
  Pierce is depicted as an alcoholic. Also much oddball trivia is
  mentioned, such as that George Washington had dentures made of
  hippo bone rather wood. The biographical information is at least
  somewhat educational, especially on the lesser known presidents
  such as Millard Fillmore and Zachary Taylor. But most people who
  study history will already known much of what is written here.
  The truth is that O'Brien is not an actual presidential historian
  with scholarly credentials. But rather a freelance writer who
  apparently just read a few books, such as "The Reader's Companion
  to the American Presidency," and then gathered together the bits
  he thought would be the most scandalous and entertaining. Also
  O'Brien provides no original research and some of what he reports
  as being factual is still subject to debate among scholars.
  However, what I found most disturbing about this book is
  O'Brien's tone and attitude. His so-called "humorous style" is
  basically a series of lame wisecracks and insults directed
  against the various presidents, especially those he dislikes. For
  example, he jokingly suggests that Andrew Jackson had "some
  unknown frontal lobe damage". I have no problem challenging the
  policy decisions of a particular president. In fact, I disagree
  with much of Jackson's presidential agenda, especially his
  bigoted policies directed against American Indians. However, I
  also think it is possible to have political disagreements without
  resorting to the sort of cheapshots that O' Brien uses. Overall,
  I found the book to be juvenile, mean-spirited and overly
  negative. There are many better researched and well written books
  on presidential history out there. So don't waste your time on
  this one.</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">With the New Year just more than six hours
  away, I must tell you that no matter a full moon, half moon,
  quarter moon, or no moon at all, please avoid the flick
  "Darkwolf" for many moons to come. What a joke. What a silly,
  stupid, insult to one's intelligence. The script could have been
  written by my dog Stan...and even then, I give him the benefit of
  the doubt to come up with something much more canine. Let's put
  it this way. Have you ever seen a film that contained people that
  irritated you so much, you simply didn't give a ^&amp;amp;^%* if
  they got blown away? I was hoping the entire cast got mulched by
  Mr. Wolf less that 30 minutes into this loser. Go "Darkwolf".
  Take a few chucks out of this cast, its director, producer,
  writer and editors as quickly as possible...and don't wait until
  the next full moon. "Darkwolf" is an insult to motion pictures.
  More so, it is an insult to such credible werewolf classics as
  "The Wolf Man", "Wolfen" and "The Howling", not to mention the
  tongue-in-cheek horror classic "An American Werewolf in London".
  Need I say more? "Darkwolf" has no bite. It's claws and fangs
  have been chiselled to oblivion. The box claims this flick to be
  "Half Man. Half Wolf. Pure Evil." In reality it is Half/Whole
  Stupid. Half/Whole Worthless. ...and...Pure ^%&amp;amp;*! Get my
  drift? At midnight...as we turn another page and the new year
  unfolds...I promise you you will enjoy reruns of every episode of
  "Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman", much more than "Darkwolf". I'm off
  to watch yet another New Year's flick before dawn. I need to make
  amends to Lon Chaney, Jr. before midnight. Bottom line, it was a
  film you didn't really care "where" the "wolf" came from, or
  where the werewolf was going. Pitiful...embarrassing..."I've seen

  reasonable, nay, likely path we'll follow should selective
  physical laws break down. Quick! Stop me! I feel the need to wave

  <Text category="music">When I first saw this album I thought "Heavy
  D....WITHOUT The Boyz?! That can't be a good thing." Here's the
  problem with this album: Heavy D took the "jiggy" route. When I
  heard "Big Daddy" for the first time, I thought it was pretty
  tight and that it had that Heavy D feel to it. So after hearing
  that, I went and copped the disc. When I got home and read the
  liner notes, my jaw hit the floor. There was Heavy D....smoking
  cigars, iced out, and playing the big willie role (the popular
  theme for the "jiggy" crowd in '97). At that point, I realized
  that original MCs were quickly becoming extinct. After years of
  success with his group, Heavy D had jumped the fence while
  simultaneously alienating his fan base all at the same time. That
  might not have been such a bad thing had this album been at least
  somewhat decent. There are about three tracks on the entire album
  that are even worth a listen. There's a lot of lazy and
  predictable production (we're talking obscene amounts of beat
  jacking). On "I'll Do Anything" Heavy D and Tony Dofat COMPLETELY
  jacked Hall &amp;amp; Oates for their tune "I Can't Go For That
  (No Can Do)" and it only gets worse throughout the album (I won't
  even get into how the Gap Band's "Yearnin' For Your Love" was
  abused on "Keep It Comin'"). There aren't enough good songs on
  this album to make Heavy's change of heart seem very believable.
  Avoid this album y'all. It's not completely terrible, but it
  comes dangerously close. There are songs that border on wack and
  there are songs that are completely wack. Sadly enough, this can
  be said for the majority of the songs on this album. I was very
  disappointed in Heavy D and lost a little respect for him after
  hearing this. I can only reccomend buying this if you can find it
  used for less than $3.00. Otherwise, avoid at all costs. Standout

  in a way that makes it confusing. They openly admit they dont

  <Text category="book">One tiresome, heavy-handed simile after
  another; agonizing, descriptive detail that unnecessarily
  prolongs action; simplistic, trite phrasing and dialogue --
  characters constantly express vague but contradictory emotions in
  the same sentence, an obvious effort by the author to provoke
  interest or conflict which falls flat; routine characterization;
  a sentence or two slipped in during a scene or an unexpected
  circumstance placed at the end of a chapter meant to build plot
  and suspense read as forced and predictable; proofreading errors;
  fragmented, poor sentence structure -- this book is amateurish
  writing all the way around. I cannot fathom the reasoning for the
  quality of the professional reviews which this work received. I
  cannot understand the lack of proper editing. I am an avid reader
  and approached this book with much enthusiasm, so imagine my
  disappointment when I was ready to put the book down a couple of
  pages into the Prologue! In fairness to the author (and with a
  hopeful attitude), I forced myself through the first 70 or so
  pages, however with each turning page I found myself reading
  along just for sport, my mind constantly drifting and more and
  more incredulous (and annoyed) with this juvenile effort. What
  could have been a fascinating read due to the intriguing premise
  is instead a colossal waste of time.</Text>
  <Text category="book">This book has its good points. If anything, it
  helps you put into words what you want from a supervisor, but it
  is not very accurate. The online test does not account for a
  difference between when 2 of their options are both exactly like
  you, or if they don't describe you at all. This messes up the
  results, and it did not describe me very well. I am not just in
  denial. I have taken a lot of personality type tests, like the
  Keirsey Temperment sorter and have a pretty good idea of my
  strengths. So, although this book is pretty good in making you
  understand the importance of incouraging your strengths, it still
  leaves you wondering about how you fit in to their terminology.
  As for using this book as a manager to better serve your
  employees, I'v seen it done and it does not necessarily work
  because the strengths spit out for people were not wholly
  accurate. The company I work for has done this, and most of the
  people who were shifted around to better serve their strengths
  (according to this book) are very unhappy in their new positions.

  <Text category="book">I think in retrospect I wasted my time on this
  one. It had a great premise that indulged me into buying this
  book but who knew dark days lied ahead of me. As I read through
  the last chapters trying to uncover the mystery, I kept on hoping
  that there would be something more to it, something more
  enigmatic, a brilliant twist but I was left with despair. My
  major problem with this novel was there were not enough, in fact
  hardly anybody whom the reader could suspect as the possible
  killer. And bringing out a totally new character at the very end
  to describe the proceedings only shows a lack of respect to the
  mind of the reader who had been guessing until now about various
  other possibilities. I will never touch this author's book again!

  return home to Babylon after his recovery. Such a disappointment

  <Text category="book">As I read this book, When Madeline Was Young,
  I felt as though I was lost, wandering through a forest,
  searching for something - a beautiful butterfly, a perfect
  flower, a mystical cottage. But there's nothing there. It's just
  a forest full of a confusing tangle of leaves and vines and
  nothing mystical at all. And that's how this book is written. It
  is a tangle of thoughts and words, spread from the first page to
  the last. Nothing special at all. I've read all of Jane
  Hamilton's books. I loved The Book of Ruth. Adored A Map of the
  World. They were both wonderful and I will always have positive
  comments for them, but I doubt I will ever buy another book by
  Ms. Hamilton. It's not that I want a "formula" book. But I do
  want to read something that I can relate to and I don't relate to
  this at all. I don't like Mac, the narrator. His mother is just
  plain strange and not endearing or believable at all. I can't
  stand Buddy, his cousin. The rest of the characters I barely know
  and, quite frankly, don't want to get to know. Perhaps I've
  changed since her first book came out. Perhaps the author has.
  But whatever the differences, my love of Jane Hamilton's books
  has ended. Sadly</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My 7 year old saw the ads for DigiDraw and
  drove me absolutely crazy until Christmas rolled around last

  unwrapped this toy was short-lived. It was nearly impossible to

  straight line was too much for an adult let alone a 7 year old.

  <Text category="dvd">This movie was so horrible I don't know where
  to start. Maybe I could start with the fact the actors were so
  horrible it was as if the director picked them randomly off the
  street. Or maybe he just casted his own family...at any rate they
  were untrained and stale. Secondly, I had a serious issue with
  this movie not following basic christian principles. If Tyler
  Perry manages to tone down the swearing in his semi-christian
  plays, why wouldn't this movie director have enough sense to
  follow suit...If you're trying to actually sale to a christian
  audience. Furthermore, I thought the bible said a little
  something against divorce; like it wasn't permitted unless your
  spouse commits adultery/fornication. This movie seems to say it's
  okay to go against the word of God if you're in love. In fact,
  christianity was more of a theory in this movie than it was a
  practice....by even the protagonist! I laugh as I think of the
  scene where Ce-Ce Peniston's character says seductively, "I'm
  looking for a man with his mind on Jesus" Yet she's dressed like
  a hooker. Speaking of clothing, why did Ce-Ce seem to change
  outfits even in the middle of scene. They go on a date and she's
  dressed one way, by the time they come home she has on something
  different; with no logical explanation. And please explain why
  they had someone's grandfather playing the role of Rico Suave.
  Maybe the movie would have actually been worth while had he
  looked more like the man of any woman's dream. I felt more like
  telling him about AARP than I did falling in love with him. In
  addition, the soundtrack, IT-WAS-JUST-ANNOYING. At some parts it
  was even hard to hear what the characters were saying because of
  the music. I just wanted the maddness to stop! Lastly, It seems
  as if the director tried to portray single church women as being
  overwhelmingly desperate (although some are) However, having
  pamela fall so quickly for bryant was just, well, almost
  juvenile...perhaps even a disrespect to women at large. Overall,
  this movie made me want to puke. PASTOR Larry "Flash" Jenkins
  really needs to get some true insight on the conditions of the
  church and maybe even go back and read the bible for himself for
  clarity</Text>

  comes off very easily, it is not heavy enough for them to pull up
  on without tipping over onto them, and the seat is very wide and
  square so their legs will have to grow considerably before they
  would be able to ride it. Also some of the stickers are starting
  to peel off and we've only had it a month. For an older child it
  would probably make a decent ride on toy, but if you are wanting

  When you first place the discs in the player, it skips over the

  There is no Spanish or Portuguese dubbed audio on the discs
  (despite what the menus and packaging claim) and the episodes
  automatically play with Spanish subtitles even when the subtitles
  are turned "off." The only way to avoid this is to choose "other"
  subtitles with the remote. This appears to be an authoring issue,
  as I am using a two year-old Sony Dream System DVD player and
  have not had these issues with previous seasons. I'm exchanging

  <Text category="book">I bought LeapPad Plus Writing on impulse at
  the store, wanting to help my son with writing, phonics, etc. He
  used it a few times, but I almost have to beg for him to use
  it...and that's sad. I wish I would have gotten the original
  LeapPad or perhaps even the Leapster. For one thing, the book
  doesn't recognize all pencil movements. A child could make an
  incorrect number or letter, and it doesn't seem that the LeapPad
  would recognize it. Also, the child has to keep erasing over and
  over, providing limited usage. Not only that, there are only a
  few books published with LeapPad Writing in mind, and the
  exercises are repetitive (e.g. writing the number 6 ten times).
  I've bought quite a few LeapPad books and Quantum Pad books for
  my son, and he is just not interested after initial use. I'm sure
  he's learned a little bit of phonics using the phonics books and
  such, but I think he learns more from workbooks bought at a
  bookstore or a department store--and they're cheaper! Not only
  that LeapPad books are very short...much shorter than workbooks
  you can buy. Considering that LeapPad books are usually around
  $15 a pop--and that Amazon doesn't carry/list them all and there
  is a VERY limited selection in Stuff Mart-type stores (at least,
  that's the case in my geographical area)--you may want to
  re-consider investing in the LeapPad system.</Text>

  <Text category="book">I am not going to repeat other reviewers
  discussion of the lack of character development. My issue is with
  the lack of basic research. One incident has Hawke's Zodiac being
  fired upon by a French Patrol Boat's missile. Bell uses the
  Harpoon missile as the weapon. The French have their own very
  effective ship to ship missile in the Exocet. Very unlikely that
  the French would use an American made Harpoon. Later in the
  novel, Hawke is taking off from a carrier deck in the latest VTOL
  aircraft, the F-35. The catapult fails and Hawke is put in grave
  danger. My problem, this is a VTOL aircraft, which the author
  goes to great lengths to mention and describe. Why would there be
  a "cat shot" at all. VTOLs are designed for vertical takeoff and
  then transistion into level flight, which, again the author
  describes. Also this scene has nothing to do with the story. Just
  another "Saturday Cliff Hanger" episode. This is my second
  attempt at a Ted Bell novel, ASSASIN being the first. There are
  too many other writers out there than give a sense of

  it will turn backwards. But once you get it lined up right it

  <Text category="music">Following on from the fantastic 'The Duel'
  Allison Moorer's latest release 'Getting Somewhere' is a massive,
  massive disappointment. Quite simply the material on 'Getting
  Somewhere' is weak and gutless. On the rare occasions Moorer
  tries to emulate the beauty and feel of 'The Duel' - such as on
  Hallelujah &amp;amp; New Years Day - Earle rips the heart out of
  the material with such an amateurish, pedestrian and thin
  production that you feel cheated ! Business and pleasure rarely
  mix and Moorer should take a long, hard look at this release and
  give serious consideration to re-installing RS Field next time
  around. If Moorer wants a guitar groove that burns , drums that
  drive and vocals that mesmerise then Earle is simply not the man
  for the job. Moorer is a fantastic talent who has one of the
  finest female voices of any genre (she can write a mean song too
  ! ) . This CD showcases none of her abilities and should be
  consigned to the bargain bins immediately</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I bought these slippers after reading these
  reviews, thinking "they are really cute, how bad can they smell?"
  Well, let me tell you on Christmas morning they lasted about 20
  minutes in the living room before they were thrown outside on the
  porch, and they were back at the store 2 days later being
  returned. The smell is beyond awful, and is absolutely
  unbearable. As cute as these slippers are for your princess, do
  yourself a favor and get something else. These are

  <Text category="health">The concept is cute, although the size makes
  it a bit difficult to store when you are not wearing them, but
  the main problem is that they give you hat hair, compressing your

  go in between the hairs, so everything fluffs out. If you never
  take off your reading glasses, have a buzz cut, are bald or
  otherwise wear your hair flat against your head (but be careful
  of buns), the clic connect reader may be fine for you. Otherwise,
  conventional glasses are a better bet</Text>
  <Text category="music">As others have noted, this was a time of
  turmoil for the group. Now trimmed back to a fourpiece (they had
  just lost guitarist/singer Bob Weston and singer Dave Walker),
  they also changed producers after 5 straight albums they had
  either self-produced or collaborated with Martin Birch on. This
  CD also leans really heavily on material from Bob Welch (this
  would be his last release with the band) and it suffers deeply
  for that. Most of the few highlights here are furnished by
  Christine McVie. The title cut is a nice lament about male
  prevarication. The understated "Prove Your Love" is also a
  winner. Of the Welch contributions, the only real standouts are
  the mystical "Bermuda Triangle" and gentle closer "Safe Harbour".
  There are plenty of miscues, filler, and outright bad material
  here. McVie's "Come a Little Bit Closer" is produced like it
  WANTS to be a hit, but it's much too slight to stick in the
  memory. Welch's "She's Changing Me" sounds like Chicago colliding
  with the Mac...the horns don't work here. The handclap bridge in
  "Silver Heels" seems too poppy and out of place in the context of
  the rest of the tune, which is execrable anyway. The silver
  lining to this disc is that what might have been a death knell
  turned into the band's finest hour just one album later..</Text>
  <Text category="health">Hello, (I trully hope you don't lose your
  money, because it trully hurts to buy something so expensive with
  high hopes). =( trust me, this doesn't work, i sadly bought both
  of them Body Bare and LAdyfair. I spent over $300.00 including
  s/h and boy was i dissapointed. I would like to say, that if you
  would like to purchase a personal trimmer or private area shaver
  you should think about it, i would like to tell you so that no
  one else is fooled by the looks or sites. I also bought
  everything with it! i got the entire combo and more. Since i
  wanted to be completely shaven without having to go through
  brazilian waxing pain i researched for over 2 weeks!!!! 2 weeks!
  none stop to make sure i bought the right product. Body bare or
  Ladyfair are the same. These trimmers don't do anything, sadly a
  normal shaver is better than this. Plus it leaves BUMPS AND

  <Text category="dvd">I used to think he was great, till I caught
  the Director's Cut of 'Das Boot.' All of a sudden you're
  confronted with this ridiculous synthesizer music that wasn't in
  the original, and the spell is broken. Let's not even talk about
  'Air Force One.' Now I've seen 'The Perfect Storm' twice, and I
  own the book, but I still haven't read it because I'm reasonably
  sure the book MUST suck if the movie is this bad. And I'm sorry
  New England, but what are Gloucestermen anyways, except for great
  rapers of the high seas? What will they NOT do for a buck, you
  might ask. Ok, they are not as bad as the Japanese, but they all
  stalk the world on floating slaughterhouses like there's no
  tomorrow. Watching this movie definitely made me take fish off
  the menu. Sure you will find excitement aplenty, amped up to
  eleven. Even experience fleeting moments when you might ponder
  the plight of seafarers throughout history. I even like some of
  the principal actors, but in the end all they do is make a pretty
  bad movie slightly more interesting than it should be. This just
  doesn't stand up to repeat viewings. Unless you enjoy feeling

  <Text category="dvd">Undoubtedly the worst 'Best Of' DVD ever made,
  even if someone gives this DVD as a gift you should punch that
  person in the face...after watching this DVD I felt like burning
  down the company that made this DVD . If you want to play a
  practical joke on someone then might as well give this DVD to him
  as a gift. There might be emotional reasons why there were some
  positive reviews of this horror, but it can't be for the actual
  DVD. There aren't words to describe how bad it looks and sounds.
  Shame on the band for putting this out. Obviously all them cares
  about is getting the money and run with a 'Best Of' on DVD. This
  item should be removed from the shelves for poor quality in
  picture. My taped videos on VHS from MTV and VH1 sound and look
  better than these ones, really. This essay in amatuerism may have
  some interest. For worse, is unforgivable is not including the
  whole video stuff from 90's to 2000. 'Love Is Blindness', 'Walk
  On', 'Elevation' and several alternative videos were edited out.
  Didn't they have another filmed version of 'Gone'?. Mexico City
  1997 was just a below average performance. Shame on U2 for keep
  going with 'Gone' from that bad shaped Bono's rough night. I
  still don&amp;#x1A;t understand why we must to keep watching the
  same footage for a particular song. I&amp;#x1A;m talking about
  'Until The End Of The World'. In case you don&amp;#x1A;t know,
  THERE&amp;#x1A;S an actual video clip from that song. Rather,
  they just put the well known Sidney 1993 version here. Rumors say
  they're going to release a DVD Boxset by late this year. I really
  don't want 'remastered' versions of shows we've been watching for
  even 22 years. Rather, I'm fond of watching previously unreleased
  footage. Just in case, here's a list of several unreleased
  PRO-SHOT filmed concerts from early 80's to Pop Mart Tour (I
  didn't include Elevation because there're 2 DVD's out there from
  the same Tour). Cheers 1- Belfast 23-01-1981 (AWESOME CONCERT!)

  <Text category="dvd">I'm watching the film right now, and it is
  perhaps the most moronic and stupidly annoying film I've ever
  seen. There's nothing amusing going on. It's all fluff and show.
  It is such garbage. I find it offensively stupid</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Maybe it's because I had never read the book
  and never heard of Hunter S. Thompson before this movie, but I
  found this movie to be unbearably boring and so utterly
  pointless! At what point in the movie-making process while
  reading the script aloud, did they realize that this isn't a
  movie? Or maybe that the book couldn't be made into a commercial
  movie? The "story" if it can be called such, is apparently about
  a journalist and his fat hispanic friend (called his lawyer) who
  go to Las Vegas to write an article on some motorcycle race of
  some sort or something. That's completely irrelevant, because
  probably 5-10 minutes is actually spent on that subject, with an
  additional 20 minutes at most devoted to the guy actually trying
  to accomplish the task. The rest is just Johnny Depp as the main
  character rambling mindlessly about a variety of subjects, most
  of which deal with drugs, or drug-related things. Others having
  nothing at all to do with anything. They are quite literally
  taking every drug known to mankind, and the movie chronicles them
  taking drugs. There are some scenes in which the duo are in their
  hotel room, where the "lawyer" freaks out in a bathtub and
  threatens to kill himself. In other scenes, they are in the hotel
  club, or at a restaurant. No matter where they are, they are
  always high on some drug, and Johnny Depp's character (Thompson
  himself based on his experience, under a fake name) is rambling
  or talking very very quickly and nonsensically. There are cameos
  by minor celebrities, some of which are world famous today. Gary
  Busey is on screen for all of three or four minutes as a highway
  sheriff who sexually harrasses JD's character. Tobey Maguire is
  on even less as a hitchhiker who bails out of the car when he
  realizes the duo are stoned out of their mind and crazy. The only
  moment in which I had a great laugh was in the beginning, where
  they are hallucinating that they are being attacked by bats as
  they drive down a desert highway. When the "lawyer" stops to pick
  up the hitchhiker, JD's char says "We can't stop here! This is
  bat country!". That line and its delivery alone deserve the movie
  its one miserable star. I expected better from Terry Gilliam. If
  this movie was attempting to be shocking or pro- or anti-drug or
  stylish or artistic in some way, it is obviously only a most
  acquired taste, like a group of people who think consuming waste
  is an acquired taste. There is no moral message here, nothing
  pro- or anti-drug, nothing shocking save that these two aren't
  dead by the third day from taking so many drugs, or stylish or
  artistic. Not the worst movie ever, but definitely one of them. I
  don't know what orifice people pull this "great movie" idea out
  of, but I'd like to examine that, and find out why</Text>

  <Text category="toys_games">After receiving, putting together and using
  this toy with myself and children, I overestimated what it would
  be. I remember the old school Rock 'em Sock 'em Robots, and this
  product isn't even close. The old characters stood 6-8" tall and
  both necks sprung up with metal parts when a blow to the head was
  delivered. This version has only plastic parts, the characters
  are 4" tall at best, and the 'win' is from a blow to the chest,
  not the head. Metallo's head springs up, but Superman's head only
  nods backward. It is difficult to discern the 'winner' from the
  set up. It was only an $11 lesson for me to learn, but if you
  truly want a real Rock 'em set, try eBay, or yard sales. This
  replica is not comparable to the original</Text>

  <Text category="toys_games">We loved this pool for three weeks, which is

  amount of rain water from the cover to find that the cover with
  roughly 1/4" of rain had collapsed the top tier and that we had
  grass growing up through the bottom of the pool, through plastic.
  I could see both happening had the pool sat in one place for a
  long period of time but this was after less than 24 hours. A
  total waste of money</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This is fun and a good idea, but the quality
  of the stand and the plastic is very poor. It fell apart the
  first time we had it up, and while you can put it back together,
  unless you want to be doing it every ten seconds, it isn't worth
  it. The keyboard itself is fine. The microphone overpowers the
  keyboard music and has no volume on it, but the keyboard does.
  The microphone stand is really cheap plastic and broke right
  away. I would suggest buying a cheap keyboard and microphone and
  just using it on a table instead, or if you buy this product,
  don't expect to use the keyboard stand for long, but it can work
  without it</Text>

  <Text category="book">Communism is one of the most evil ideologies
  in human history, responsible for the extermination of 100+
  million people. This book (which started it all) holds at least
  much of the blame. Communists were and still are a threat to the
  free world, and communism is a slave system. Some "intellectuals"
  actually support the tired mantras of Marx's philosophy, whether
  because they are insincere or simply pedants who haven't seen
  enough sunlight, I don't know. In any case, if they ever step
  foot in the real world they would take note that communism denies
  private property, and is totalitarian and slave-driving (the
  government owns everything, including you). And the deaths caused
  by communism are hardly necessary to bring up. Pol Pot, Mao,
  Stalin (of course), etc etc...who are these people kidding</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">"House of Mirth" is one of the most depressing
  movies I've ever seen. To be clear: I've seen movies like, oh,
  say, "Schindler's List," or "The Heart is a Lonely Hunter" that
  treat tragic events, either in the macrocosm or the microcosm,
  that did not leave me depressed. Rather, they were powerful works
  of art that moved me and made me think. "House of Mirth" deals
  with tragic themes, including human society's ability to destroy
  its own, and the power of hypocrisy and hypocrites. It wasn't,
  though, moving or thought provoking. I wasn't moved by Gillian
  Anderson's portrayal of a betrayed woman who lives by her own
  sense of honor. I didn't believe Gillain Anderson's portrayal of
  a betrayed woman who lives by her own sense of honor. Rather, I
  was bored. I kept wanting the film to go faster. It's a great
  irony; Edith Wharton's novels are real page turners. Quick, to
  the point. Hollywood has yet to adapt one of her books in a way
  that honors this quality. "House of Mirth" has gorgeous clothing
  and sets. I didn't care about anybody onscreen, though. I didn't
  believe anybody onscreen. I felt that this movie had a
  misanthropic agenda, and it moved its players around as if they
  were chess pieces, as if to prove these points: people are
  hypocrites, see! People are insincere, see! If a person has any
  decency at all, that person is destroyed, see! I would tend to
  agree with all of the above points. So ... why do I need to watch
  this movie? Also, as a woman, who, as Lily Bart was meant to, has
  lived her life by her own code of honor and paid the price for
  that, I felt that this movie, no less than the Polite Society it
  depicts so brutally, betrayed Lily Bart. Lily Bart is just a step
  above a passive masochist in this film. She all but participates
  in her own destruction. You want, just once, for her to show some
  initiative, some intelligence, some ability to create her own
  fate. The film denies her those abilities. In this crippling of
  Lily Bart, the film seems to hate her as much as polite society
  does. Movies like "Gone with the Wind" that depict spunky
  heroines occasionally winning, and occasionally gaining some
  power, imo, are much easier to watch. One might argue that such
  films are not realisitic. I don't know. Even we real-life Lily
  Barts have our resources, and our triumphs. And, again, watching
  Lily Bart in "House of Mirth" slowly being eroded onscreen was
  not a feminist experience for me. It was more of an art house
  snuff film that utterly disempowered its female heroine.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">If you are planning on getting a good deck
  then do not waste your time with this..it has the essentials,
  sure, but your money is better spent at one of the 4 "STRUCTURE
  DECKS"!! They are much better than this..I can say so beacuse my
  sis owns this deck and I can beat her every time :) Konami needs
  to put some better stuff in this deck - like Senju of the
  Thousand Hands X 2. Also they need to take away the change of
  heart since it's "advanced" forbidden. but still, this deck
  deserves an OK rating since it has all the essentials..this is no
  better than the first yugi starter deck. So if you ALREADY have a
  starter deck, do not get this as it is not worth it - a lot of

  <Text category="book">The writing was not what I expect of Andre

  people to capture his sister. The book covers over 2 years, but
  you hardly hear of this again. I cannot imagine the sorcerer
  would just have let it drop. I am a long-time fan and retired

  <Text category="book">The book is well-written. Most parts of it I
  can agree with. But there is a crucial mistake in Parson's
  message --- oneness likes to play separation. I can say clearly
  that oneness does not play separation. Duality/ego is simply a
  mistake/illusion caused by mind-evolution. Saying that oneness
  plays separation is giving reality to this illusion. Also, his
  message that we can not do anything still gives one a feeling
  that one is under the "mercy" of something, and this is clearly
  very dualistic. Without ego, both doing and not doing are actions
  of oneness, to intentionally emphasizing not doing is a mistake.
  There are many illuminating sentenses in this book, but be aware
  of the neo-advaitan trap. In my life, it was understanding,
  especially of the process of ego-illusion-image helped me to come
  to oneness. The one who is doing the understanding is still
  oneness. There is no duality in doing and not doing. At right
  this moment, you can chose to continue to read this review or to
  stop. Of courses, you make choices in daily life. If you really
  understand what is meant by "nond-duality", you will not make
  such statements such as "there is no choice".</Text>

  <Text category="book">This book is offensive to at least one of the
  two genders, though it's hard to say which. It suggests that a
  man whose brain was transplanted into that of a sensual woman
  would become a wanton harlot, more or less. Whether that's more
  insulting to the male brain or the female body, I'm not sure, but
  the book portrays neither gender realistically. I like Heinlein,
  and the first 100 or so pages of this book show a lot of
  potential, but after that the book descends into vapid sexual
  morass, and it's not even particularly good at being that. The
  gender-swapping theme has been a common one in fiction and film
  in the last 30 years or so, but Heinlein joined the ranks of the
  many authors and directors who treated it as a chance to write
  pseudo-enlightened erotica instead of literature. More's the

  <Text category="book">Susanna Rowson's &amp;amp;quot;Charlotte
  Temple&amp;amp;quot; is not the first novel and certainly not the
  last to deal with the topic of the morally fallen woman. Poor,
  pitiful Charlotte finds herself in the midst of an immoral and
  unforgiving world where one transgression sends her on the road
  to permanent ruin. Rowson encases her heroine Charlotte Temple
  within a world of virtue and vengeance. Charlotte has no possible
  means of escaping her inevitable fate because the author/narrator
  makes it clear from the onset that she has written this story as
  a lesson to young woman. She has no real interest in Charlotte as
  a dimensional character. Charlotte simply serves as a symbol of
  lost virtue and symbols do not have real emotions or feelings.
  &amp;amp;quot;Charlotte Temple&amp;amp;quot; was written in 1794
  and became one of the first best sellers of the newly formed
  America. A morally abhorrent woman who pays for her sins almost
  always guaranteed a best seller in the eighteenth century and now
  &amp;amp;quot;Charlotte Temple&amp;amp;quot; has been
  rediscovered and published in a Scholarly Press edition. Was this
  reclamation of Charlotte really necessary? In the past twenty
  years, feminist scholars have rediscovered authors and texts that
  have gone out of print or been totally ignored by the literati.
  Authors such as Anne Plumptre, Frances Burney, Aphra Behn, Sarah
  Fielding and Charlotte Lennox have been dusted off and given new
  literary lives. Feminist scholar Cathy Davidson has taken
  Charlotte Temple in hand and aims to join Rowson to the above
  list of rediscoveries. Unfortunately, Rowson does not warrant
  such treatment. Rowson has a flat, humorless approach to the
  fallen woman story. Unlike Burney's
  &amp;amp;quot;Evelina&amp;amp;quot; or
  &amp;amp;quot;Camilla,&amp;amp;quot; Rowson does not imbue her
  narrative with needed levity. Her pedantic iron-fisted preaching
  smothers the modern reader in a moral morass that confounds
  rather than illuminates. In many of the fallen women stories,
  authors would use the genre as a subversive technique to
  criticize the patriarchal structures. Rowson does engage in such
  subversion within the novel. She seeks to preach to the young
  women who may fall victim to the unscrupulous man -- in England
  and America, it was not considered altogether lady-like to read a
  novel, so Rowson would be preaching to young women who had
  already transgressed. Rowson does not criticize men within the
  novel. She does not censure Montraville for taking Charlotte as
  his mistress, impregnating her and abandoning her for a wealthier
  woman. When he believes that Charlotte has becomes his best
  friend's mistress, he does not believe that she would soil her
  reputation even though she has ruined her life by engaging in an
  illicit affair with him. He aims to enact revenge upon the friend
  for acting &amp;amp;quot;dishonorable&amp;amp;quot; against her.
  Yet if he had not acted dishonorably towards her, she would not
  have been reduced to a penniless, pregnant ex-mistress scrounging
  the streets for food and shelter. He never takes responsibility
  for his role in Charlotte's downfall. Rowson had the perfect
  opportunity for savage criticism of the patriarchy with
  Montraville but she fails to take it. Instead, Rowson places the
  blame for Charlotte's ruin on the women within the novel. When
  Charlotte leaves the safe bosom of her morally upstanding family,
  she enters into the deviant world of the female who fail to
  protect her from licentious men. Madame Du Pont errs in judgment
  by hiring the morally loose Miss La Rue. Madame Du Pont sets
  Charlotte's downfall in action. Rowson does not punish the
  ignorant Madame Du Pont by killing her, she ends up an hysterical
  mess after the Montraville/Charlotte
  &amp;amp;quot;elopement.&amp;amp;quot; Miss La Rue, the woman who
  pushes Charlotte into the arms of Montraville, must be punished
  for being a promiscuous woman. She ends up poor and begs for her
  last scrap of food. She ends up dying painfully as Rowson takes
  the opportunity to lecture her readers on the improper behavior
  of loose women. Why would modern readers want to read this? I do
  not think any intelligent would reader would want to subject
  themselves to the depressing experience of reading this novel. At
  125 pages, it seemed to progress at such an excruciating pace. No
  character has any shadings. There are no subplots to divert the
  attention from the static Charlotte. Rowson does nothing to keep
  our interest. Unfortunately Rowson has become a heroine to
  feminist scholars for her feat as the first American woman to
  have a best-selling novel. That accomplishment is noteworthy as
  literary trivia, but it does not make for engaging reading</Text>
  <Text category="health">I use three razors. Last year's model of this
  Braun, a triple blade rotary from the leading manufacturer of
  rotary razors and standard double edged disposables from the
  major manufacturer of razors. OK, now, let's do some math. I get
  10 great shaves from a disposable razor. I pay, on average, 40c
  or so for a disposable razor. That is about a nickel a shave
  including the shave cream. At a nickel a shave, it would take
  3000 shaves before I would spend $150. Would take me over 8
  years. Now, anyone that says any electric razor shaves better
  than a double edged high quality blade razor (not even the
  expensive triple edged ones, just cheap disposables) is dreaming.
  The blace does a much better job and much faster. But, sometimes,
  they can irritate the skin, but electrics can too. I can get
  irritated by both, sooooo, I rotate between them, and find that
  reduces my skin irritation problem quite well. I bought this
  Braun (last year's model) after reading the positive reviews
  here, and later bought a rotary razor. The basic difference is
  that the cheap model rotary from that major manufacturer is much
  quieter, shaves just as well, and cost me about 1/3 the price.
  The only thing that is better in the Braun is the battery lasts
  longer. It is possible also, that in some cases, it gives a
  slightly closer shave than the rotary, but it also tends to miss
  spots no matter how many times I go over them. The Braun also has
  a problem with my beard when it is longer, like when I have two
  to three days growth. The rotary and disposable razor breeze
  through that three day bush. The cleaning machine/charger that
  comes with the Braun is a joke. Yes, it cleans the razor great,
  but it is way oversized and you need a large space for it in your
  bathroom. Even then, say you have that larger space, you can pay
  between $5.00 and $8.00 each for the cleaning cartridges. I have
  found they last about a month before drying out. Add $60 to your
  annual cost to just clean your razor. The rotary cleans fine with
  a brush and the disposable razors with water. Finally, the switch
  that turns on the razor is right where you hold the razor and it
  also locks the blade. So I am constantly locking the blade
  position by accident. Inexcusable design flaw in a razor this
  price. Don't get me wrong. This razor shaves fine. It works best
  on short beards and works better than cheap razors. But for $50
  you can get a better rotary razor and for $150 you can shave for
  over 8 years with a disposable twin blade. Does the price
  difference sound rational to you? If it does, click "Proceed to
  Order"</Text>
  <Text category="book">I have read other books by Alesia Holliday and
  enjoyed them so I looked forward to reading this book.
  Unfortunately, I could not get any farther than the first 25
  pages. I even tried diving in further into the book to see if it
  got better and I still could not read more than 5 pages without
  turning away. The best I can do to pin down why I dislike it so
  much is to say that it tries too hard. No character seems to even
  approach reality. They are all, including the main character and
  her love interest, over the top</Text>

  <Text category="music">that this great music sounds so awful on this

  seemed a very good way to start. When I put it on, I couldn't
  believe how muffled and dull it sounded. I could swear I'm
  listening to the music through a wall of cotton. I went to the
  existing reviews here on Amazon, and, sure enough, Ferrara Brain
  Pan's spot-on review stated exactly what I was feeling upon
  listening to these recordings. It is inexcusable that an artist
  of Bush's stature is represented in such poor technical fashion -
  and a shame, considering how good the songs are. Another little
  beef is that the CD clocks in at under 49 minutes - in other
  words, there's room for 30 more minutes of music, which I'm
  certain could have been well-used, considering the vastness of
  her catalogue. I will be looking for the remastered individual
  albums, but if I didn't know how good Kate Bush was outside of
  the context provided by this butchered collection, I wouldn't
  bother buying any more of her material. Shame on EMI for allowing
  this. I give it two stars (instead of one) simply because the

  <Text category="book">I love mysteries set in WW II and like old

  junior varsity Tom Joad but,OK, I was game. The cast of
  characters that seemed to number in the low 80s and be
  interchangable "baddies" and "goodies". They were hard to keep
  track of without a scorecard but there is no quit in this reader
  and I pushed on. Then when we got to the Jersey shore, I found
  out that in 1942 with America fighting for it's life against
  fascism, and losing, our hero knew why. All the servicemen were
  bullies (A drafted station employee) or morons (the Coast Guard
  beach patrol). The 4F "hero" was the real McCoy however. Although
  not actually mentioned I bet he wished that dratted ear injury
  hadn't kept him from joining the Abraham Lincoln Brigade. He was
  moderate enought to think Marxism had some problems; the murder
  of 10s of millions of Ukrainians and the Nazi-USSR Pact probably
  and I say probably, didn't elude our observant literary genius.
  He was also a 1975 era feminist; all those plucky WW II women
  throwing off the handcuffs chaining them naked to the kitchen
  sink had his unhesitating support. Most big businessmen, probably
  wearing spats and silk high hats, were the bad guys needless to
  say. I wondered how someone could write such a truly awful book.
  I couldn't finish it and it's a point of honor for me to finish
  all books. Then in the bio it all became clear. The author was a

  <Text category="health">I would give this kit zero stars if I could.
  The instructions say that it takes 6-8 weeks for the seeds to
  sprout. I kept them in moist peat and warm temperatures for over
  three months after the recommended period of refrigeration. Not a
  single seed sprouted. I finally had to throw out the whole kit
  when mold took over. Complete waste of time and money. But if
  you're feeling lucky, you should know that most of the seeds in
  this kit aren't much bigger than pinheads, and they all come
  packaged together in the same tiny plastic bag. So if you want to
  have each type of plant growing in a different section of the
  plastic tray provided in the kit - like that shown on the box
  cover - you need to separate out each seed under a strong
  magnifying glass. And even then you won't be successful, as most
  of these seeds look just like ground pepper. I accidentally
  spilled a few on the floor, and after sweeping them all up I
  literally couldn't tell them from the other debris in the
  dustpan. By the way, it takes a minimum of 6-8 years living in
  ideal growing conditions for any of the plants in this kit to
  reach the sizes shown on the box cover. These are NOT plants that
  can simply be put on a windowsill. They need an environment that
  is not easily provided in the average home - LOTS of very bright
  light (about 15 hours a day), LOTS of humidity, an acidic growth
  medium (such as sphagnum moss), and about 80 degrees. And even
  then, these are VERY slow-growing plants. To keep the humidity
  level high, you'll need some kind of terrarium, preferably
  covered to keep the humidity level high. But if you use
  incandescent bulbs to provide the necessary level of light, the
  amount of heat they produce can easily raise the temperature to
  lethal levels. For this reason I recommend a combination of
  fluorescent bulbs and a moist/dry heating pad at the bottom. Be
  sure that whatever heating pad you use isn't the type that shuts
  off automatically after one hour of use. Some warnings... These
  plants flourish only in a very limited range of environments and
  nourishment. The care you would normally give a houseplant will -
  in all likelihood - kill these plants: NEVER feed them animal
  protein (like hamburger). The fats in meat aren't digestible and
  can kill them. NEVER use tap water to water them. The mineral
  build-up can kill them so use distilled water only. NEVER feed
  them insects that have been killed by insecticides, like RAID.
  Carnivorous plants should be fed soft-bodies insects like small
  slugs, ants, termites, etc., rather than hard-shelled insects
  such as beetles. Well-stocked pet stores will carry dried
  mealworms, but even these will need to be cut into very small
  pieces. Just as a baby needs tiny mouthfuls of food, so too do
  Venus flytraps. NEVER fertilize them. These are very slow-growing
  plants and any attempt to force them to grow will kill
  them.</Text>

  care about this song, its not like these lyrics mean anything to
  him, as he did not write. And on "No Promises" thats even worse
  than this, yes he might of wrote it I don't know, but does the

  <Text category="dvd">After watching Spirited Away I was excited to
  watch other movies by the same director. Unfortunately every
  movie seems to be an excuse to preach his simplistic "it's bad to
  hate" message. What the creators of Princess Mononoke and others
  like them refuse to admit is that hate is a natural reaction and
  even healthy when directed towards the destructive, disgusting
  things of the world. Yes, hate can become overly consuming, just
  as any other emotion can overcome us, or we an hate the good
  things of the world making us the bad one's,(just as loving that
  which is evil wouldn't be a good thing) but placed in its proper
  context at the proper time, at that which deserves hate helps us
  avoid dangers and deal with certain problems. And the people who
  claim that hate is all-evil themselves hate the "haters", which I
  find comical. The movie also has strong pro feminist/anti man
  messages. I wanted to like this film but I don't appreciate being
  duped into listening to people rant and rave about
  nonsense</Text>
  <Text category="music">I bought this album because I loved the title
  song. It's such a great song, how bad can the rest of the album
  be, right? Well, the rest of the songs are just filler and aren't
  worth the money I paid for this. It's either shameless bubblegum
  or oversentimentalized depressing tripe. Kenny Chesney is a
  popular artist and as a result he is in the cookie cutter
  category of the Nashville music scene. He's gotta pump out the
  albums so the record company can keep lining their pockets while
  the suckers out there keep buying this garbage to perpetuate more
  garbage coming out of that town. I'll get down off my soapbox
  now. But country music really needs to get back to it's roots and
  stop this pop nonsense. What country music really is and what it
  is considered to be by mainstream are two different
  things.</Text>

  <Text category="book">I'm the sort of guy who has a bit of trouble
  adapting to normal life. I'm still bemused and puzzled the
  mechanics of toilet-flushing. My wife (may she rest in peace)
  bought me this book as an anniversary present last month before
  she was tragically torn apart by a rabid pack of alligators at a
  Wyoming nature preserve. Anyway, life moves on. Much to my
  disappointment this book did not teach me everything I should
  know how to do. "But Fred," you might be saying (and I'll be
  saying "Fred isn't my name, idiot!"), "how do you know what you
  should know if you don't know what it is to begin with?" Ah,
  well, let me explain. See, if Tchikavoslky taught me one thought,
  it was this: I know nothing. So it is with this deep insight into
  my own mind that I came up with the following Things I Should
  Know, based on what I currently do NOT know: 1. How to start a
  hurricane. This is very important. 2. How to kill a man with a
  toothpick. What if you met a hitman at a fancy restaurant and
  found out your were his next victim? Scary. 3. How to run a
  nuclear powerplant with a one-man army. I don't want to be the
  next Homer Simpson! 4. How to raise children. I've raised ten and
  still haven't figured out what a diaper is. 5. What a diaper is.
  I don't know, my wife used to talk about them a lot. 6. How to
  drive. Sure, technically we're supposed to learn how BEFORE we
  get our driver's licenses, but like many people, I just got a
  fake one when I was 12 and have been driving since then. I've
  been in over three hundred vehicular accidents and been charged
  with five counts of manslaughter, so I figured it might be good
  to learn how to drive. 7. How to stalk a celebrity. You just
  never know. 8. How to put on underwear without leaving stain
  marks. You fellas know what I'm saying! 9. How to make coffee.
  People ask me to all the time, and because I don't know how, I
  just take some warm water and pour mud in. Thankfully no one's
  noticed my inadequacies yet, but I'm sure soon enough they will,
  after another person dies of food poisoning and internal
  infection. 10. How to kill yourself. I don't want the aliens to
  get anything out of me when I'm taken hostage. I saw it in that
  Tom Cruise movie, and it was sure scary! So with these things in
  mind, I'm severely disappointed by this book, and feel it is
  mis-marketed and stupid. Please, Barbet Schroeder (or whoever the
  author was), write a better book next time</Text>

  he's this bad. The whole thing looked like monkeys flying around
  the screen. Nevertheless, it has some funny moments like when
  Jessica's parents found all the poo sticking all over the toilet.
  The whole idea of a 'special class' was just so stupid. Nothing
  made sense. I didn't see a single point of the whole plot in the
  first place just to get a little extra cash. The first one was a
  lot better than this one. Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels were a lot
  dumber and a lot funnier. These 2 were worse than dumb and
  weren't even funny at all. I guess 'Dumb and Dumberer' would be
  better if it were still Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels starring but
  nooo, it had to be these 2 who I don't even know. Please don't
  watch it guys. It may be funny for some guys but it's mostly
  corny like kindergarteners gone wild. Watch the first one!!!

  I went to a dermatologist who did a biopsy and said that I had

  was put - the elastin in those areas was destoyed and there was a
  scarring like pattern of collagen. The normal architecture of the

  <Text category="book">While I think the basics of the book are good,
  I don't like how fat-free items are treated as always being the
  best option. I did much better on the South Beach Diet, where
  good fats in moderation is emphasized as well as natural foods.
  Fat is what makes us feel satisfied. After years of trying to
  diet by limiting fat, it was a revelation to me I could lose
  weight without feeling hungry and deprived. An omelette made of
  egg whites and fat-free cheese is not at all satisfying and not
  necessary. Secondly, many foods are altered in a negative way to
  make them low-fat. I just noticed this week that Cool Whip lite
  has high fructose corn syrup and hydrogenated vegetable oil as
  two of it's top ingredients. This can't be better for you than
  actual cream. I also prefer the book "French Woman Don't Get
  Fat", which emphasizes enjoying food by eating smaller portions
  of good, natural food when it's in season. The pleasure of good
  food makes you stop thinking diet and start thinking about
  lifestyle. I feel that the G.I Diet is oversimplified and written
  to appeal to an audience that has never thought about eating
  right before. I think this book is about the mechanics of healthy
  eating when the cause of overeating is a lot more complicated. It
  certainly can help get people on the right track, but I think
  there are better books available.</Text>

  <Text category="music">I bought Kayslays Pain From the Game about a
  week before it came out in most stores(my local cd store likes to
  sell their copies ahead of schedule;). I read that it featured
  production by Swizz Beatz, Kanye West, Eminem and the Heatmakerz.
  And as far as rappers go, most of the Shady/Aftermath camp is on
  here somewhere along with a ton of other big artists (fat joe,
  Ghostface Killah, Raekwon, Scarface, Memphis Bleek and Prodigy,
  etc). So I expected this cd to be a big step up from the
  Streetsweeper Volume 1 mixtape (which I would give 3 stars at
  best). But for all the talent on this cd there's not many good
  songs. I thought the production was pretty weak. Some no name guy
  produced most of the cd but even the kanye west, swizz beatz and
  eminem tracks are pretty bland. If you have to have every song
  your favorite rapper or producer ever made, grab this disc. If
  your looking for good music leave this one alone</Text>

  <Text category="book">As a student of urban development and

  work of a parochial mind. Davis offers a hardline Marxist view of
  Los Angeles that, by employing simply economic analysis, does not

  plays a much smaller role in the sprawl of Los Angeles -- anyone
  outside of the ISO should be discouraged from reading this
  baseless drivel</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This movie has such wonderful reviews from
  both professional critics and Amazon customers that I was
  expecting great things. While I agree the acting (especially the
  girls playing Christy and Ariel) is excellent the story is just
  too implausible and I got that impression from the minute we see
  the family crossing from Canada to the US (yes they are Irish but
  for some reason they have to sneak in to the US from Canada).
  Anyway why on earth would an apparently intelligent couple enter
  the US with their two kids illegally, without jobs or much money
  to settle in the most expensive city in the country? I know the
  dad is an actor but couldn't he have settled the family in one of
  the less expensive boroughs and taken the subway in to Manhattan?
  The mom is a teacher but can't find a job but no wonder if they
  are in the country illegally. Yet there is money for private
  school, fixing up the dump of an apartment, an expensive
  camcorder, betting the rent money on an ET doll etc. I can't
  imagine any parents moving in to an apartment building known as
  the "drug house" with two young girls and then letting the girls
  wander about as they please. Mind you the parents are a couple
  supposedly almost crippled by the guilt they feel over a third
  child - a son - that has recently died. I kept expecting someone
  to call Social Services. And the medical situations with both
  Frankie and the mom and new baby are not well thought out or
  researched. The symbolism between Mateo, the new baby and Frankie
  is very heavy handed. Though the film is told through the oldest
  daughter's eyes because of several scenes and elements the movie
  is not suited at all to children. And there are also several
  scenes that are really not connected with the oldest daughter at
  all. Maybe if I had taken it more as a fable I would have
  "gotten" this movie more but I was expecting a straight forward
  drama and was disappointed.</Text>

  She is now three months old. I practice attachment parenting so I
  know exactly when she has a bowel movement. The past two bowel
  movements the diaper has leaked horribly. She was sitting on my

  <Text category="music">The problem with America was that started out
  great. The first album was fresh and different from everything.
  Three young boys and accoustic quitars was a song all it own.
  "Horse with no name" and "SandMan", was what pave the way for
  them. The problem was that each album after that they got farther
  away from their roots and into the middle of mainstream pop. They
  should of left "Muskrat Love." to the Captain and Tennille. This
  album does a fine job of showing their career from beginning to
  end. The problem was that there was their first two albums, (
  America and Venture Highway) and there was their others. My
  recommandation would be to pick up the first 2 and leave this for
  the die hard fans</Text>

  uncool. they should at least stop doing songs about it. They have

  <Text category="dvd">... for giving every dance studio and popular

  The dancers are all talented, if self-consciously hip, and in
  great shape. But the numbers that focus more on T &amp;amp; A
  than fancy footowrk really did this show in for me. I love it
  when risks are taken with conventional dance forms, but ballroom
  dance is OTT enough ( if you've ever watched a competition) and
  doesn't need to be tarted up beyond recognition, the way it is
  here. Add the disjointed lighting and editing effects and what
  you have is a hot mess</Text>
  <Text category="book">I thought this book would be great and was
  really looking forward to making some of the recipes, but I have
  to admit I'm disappointed with the recipes and with what I've
  baked from it so far. I was surprised that so many of the recipes
  called for vegetable shortening instead of or in addition to
  butter. I know the book itself explains that shortening is used
  to achieve a certain texture, but I have read in other baking
  books that shortening is a crutch and doesn't deliver the flavor
  punch of pure butter. So I was a little skeptical, and then
  reading through the recipes, although they are very clearly
  written, there aren't a lot of extra tips on technique or
  anything for individual recipes. The book already assumes a level
  of competence. I made three recipes from the book: the essential
  chewy sugar cookie, the essential chewy chocolate chip cookie,
  and the Fudgy Brownies. All three recipes tasted delicious, so I
  can't complain there, but the brownies came out a little tough
  for my tastes, and both the cookies spread too much -- way too
  much, and I even refrigerated the dough for the sugar cookies. I
  consider myself to be an intermediate baker and have made these
  cookies from other recipes in the past with better results, so
  right now I'm wondering if I should even try any more of the
  recipes in this book or just give up. I think it's okay for a
  "base" cookie recipe book, but you would need to look elsewhere
  for better techniques or to tweak the ingredients</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This movie was cheeseball beginning to end...I
  thought the concept was corny even before I watched it but
  decided to give it a try anyway. Big mistake. A robot who can
  love? Lame! And with all this high tech stuff the docs can't
  bring the couple's real son out of a coma (or whatever was wrong
  with him) so the parents forget all about him and get some robot
  kid who can 'love' but lacks the common sense of a human making
  him a danger to himself and everyone..Brialliant plan (especially
  considering the amount of orphan human kids there must be in this
  messed up futuristic world)..Then the real son wakes up and comes
  home and thats when the problems with the robot kid begin. The
  family decides they don't want the robot and the mom 'loves' him
  so much she dumps him somewhere instead of sending him back to
  the lab to be humanely disposed of...It was then I knew I was
  smelling a stinker but NOOOOO someone else wanted to watch it
  till the end until he soon found out the horrible truth...I have
  since nicknamed it Artificial Idiocy...The worst part was the
  end, Ugh, I don't even want to get into it but those of you who
  see the title of my review above and have seen the movie know
  what I mean. The whole plot was muddled and full of holes with no
  sense of realism. For those of you who have not seen it, I
  suggest renting it before you buy it. Maybe this movie is great

  <Text category="toys_games">I saw an advertisement for this toy on the tv.
  I was SHOCKED that they were still selling it! Years ago, my
  young son got his arm trapped inside the hole where the balls
  come out. We had called Playskool and they had us return it to
  the store and they sent us a free 'I'm sorry' gift. The one
  pictured on Amazon is the DANGEROUS one that many kids have
  gotten their arms stuck in. If you look on the Playskool website,
  they have a newer version which offers a cover over the hole
  where kids like to stick their little paws. Be sure you get the
  newer version! It is a super cute toy, and I am glad they have

  <Text category="toys_games">Santa gave this to our daughter this year. I
  am thoroughly disappointed with it. We put the batteries in and
  started it up. After reading the how to part, the graphics are
  terrible. I had to prompt her to which flower to step on, not
  that that was necessary. The princesses started dancing without
  stepping on the flower, it just made a funny sound. The dancers
  go fast and fuzzy. You can't tell for sure what the foot work is
  doing for the ballroom steps. I even went on the mat and "tried."
  My daughter lasted all of about five minutes and was done. I hope
  Santa will take this back</Text>

  <Text category="book">I have written software for development
  projects for 30 years and I have managed several projects. Martin
  Fowler has extraordinary insight, and I enjoy reading his papers
  for the gems of thought I find. The main lesson I pick up from
  this book is: Break your large project into projects sufficiently
  small that you can sensibly abandon Refactoring for each of the
  small projects. Refactoring works well in some cases, I suppose.
  Refactoring works well for some people, I suppose. I'm skeptical,
  though. Fowler filled the book with page after page of the
  detailed Refactoring method applied to a problem he acknowledged
  as too simple for application of Refactoring. He assures us that
  Refactoring may overload small projects with methodology, making
  it unsuitable for them, and it works really well for larger
  projects. I suspect, however, that the burden it imposes enlarges
  as the job enlarges. Fowler gives me no good reason to think
  otherwise. If I'm to risk this methodology on a large project, I
  want to see it perform well on a smaller project first. Fowler
  conceives methodologies that attract zealous disciples. In the
  case of Refactoring, the methodology may succeed for its
  attractiveness rather than for its practical utility</Text>

  <Text category="music">I can't believe none of the other reviews of
  the Ultra Lounge series state that these CD's contain almost all
  instrumental music, with very few songs that feature vocals. I
  expect a lounge music CD to have a mix of both vocal and
  instrumental tracks, and of the four Ultra Lounge CD's I
  purchased, I count only three songs with vocals on all four of
  them. While the instrumental songs do fit the genre of lounge
  music, they tend to blend into one another and become mundane
  after hearing several of them. The titles of the Ultra Lounge
  CD's (such as Bachelor Pad or Bossanova) mean very little, as
  each CD fails to distinguish itself from any other because of all
  of the instrumental tracks. The best lounge CD I have heard so
  far is from an unlikely source. I purchased it at Pottery Barn,
  and it has a great mix of vocal and instrumental songs. Keep this
  in mind when buying lounge music CD's so that you won't be

  bought this razor. The razor cleans and lubricates automatically

  closer inspection I found out that the fluid had leaked out all
  over, and this fluid destroys everything it touches that isn't
  metal or plastic. I thought maybe I had done something to cause
  the problem so I refilled the cleaning base and started the
  cleaning process. Immediately the fluid in the base started
  spewing out of the cracks where the top of the base and the
  bottom of the base come together. It is now headed to the

  <Text category="dvd">You know the feeling...that feeling of "Oh my
  gosh, how did I ever spend money on this movie and when is it
  ever going to end?" Well, that's what unfortunately accompanies
  this dull and somber film. Unfortunately, because of its all-star
  cast, although this wouldn't be the first time in movie history
  where an all-star cast is wasted. Aside from an interesting peek
  into the world of Yale's secret Skull and Bones society, a
  delightful cameo by Joe Pesci and a few too cute-by-half zingers,
  this movie has little or nothing to offer. It doesn't keep one's
  attention and by the time you try to care enough about what is
  going on, you realize that you don't even care about the
  characters. Matt Damon's skulking and scowling leading role lacks
  rhythm and chemistry, especially with the beautiful Angelina
  Jolie, and he is laughably miscast as a father. In fairness
  however, with the script he's been given, it's hard to see how
  Damon could have done much better. The pacing of the film is
  extradinarily slow and one can just imagine people walking out of
  the theater before it ends. A huge disappoinment especially since
  director DeNiro is such a talented actor. Skip it</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I am an active 48 year old and I own a Vurtego
  Pro Pogo stick. I ride motocross and I mountain bike regulary and
  I like the exercise and fun factor it offers. I chose the Vurtego
  Pro after doing some online research and I am totally pleased
  with the performance. The guys who designed and developed the
  Vurtego Pro and Fit sticks were looking for a way to offer a more
  affordable model for beginers and people looking for a fun but
  still high quality stick. The Power model came up short of their
  extpectations and they pulled thier endorsement due to quality
  and safety concerns. For the money the Power Pogo is a fairly
  decent pogo stick but its not going to stand up to the abuse and
  demands of an expert or extreme pogo stick rider. It takes allot
  of effort and experience to go 6' or higher on any pogo stick. I
  am pretty good at mine, after about a month of use I am getting
  up in the 3' range and bouncing 500 plus consecutive times in a
  session before taking a break and going for another session or
  two, a great workout! I have pogo stick experience and can pull
  off most of the basic tricks, I consider myself a beginner to
  intermediate at the most. I doubt that I will ever reach the six
  foot level at my age, but that was never my goal. I know that the
  people at Vurtego are still working to develope a model that will
  be safe and affordable for those looking for a capeable, high
  quality and durable stick. If your looking to go 6' and pull off
  serious stunts I would buy the orignal Vurtego Pro or the Fit
  model for a great workout. If you are looking for a little less I
  would wait for the next version that the Vurtego people will
  offer and endorse. I personally would avoid this one.</Text>

  <Text category="toys_games">This was big on my 8 year-old son's Christmas
  list, mainly because of the Ben 10 game. He even wanted it more
  than any other game system. Although I wasn't about to pay full
  price for it, we got it at about 60% off for the main console. So
  we got it, paid for an extra controller, the Ben 10 Game CD, and
  a couple of Ben 10 Booster Packs. The unwrapping was a hit, and
  the excitement of the first play-through went over great with my
  son. But I noticed right away that it was not going to last. The
  game itself contains graphics from about 10 years ago. The game
  play is difficult, and both my son and I would find it easy to
  die, thus restarting the game for both of us. You can only play
  with the characters that happens to have come in your game or
  booster packs, and that's not many. (Want more? Fork out more $$$
  for more booster packs.) And finally, it takes so long to load
  from the CD (and it has to load EVERY level) that it must be a 1x
  drive. Seriously slow. Although my son still loves the IDEA of it
  and has not admitted he's disappointed, he does comment on how
  slow it is, and how he wishes he had other kids to trade the
  cards with so he could get more. Apparently we were the only
  suckers to buy it around here. It hasn't been played but maybe 4
  times in the one month since Christmas. If you notice it to be on
  a HUGE discount, it may be worth it. But remember, you have to
  pay extra for more cards. Personally, I wish we'd bought a used

  yet because she's a raw talent and not yet coherent in theme. I
  saw her live on the Chicks with Attitude tour with Liz Phair and
  the Cardigans and Charlotte Martin and Rose was the worst
  performer of the night. The first problem is that her voice just
  isn't that strong, secondly, her lyrics never come out as if
  they're honest and as if they are always a pretension that people
  feel a cool girl growing up should say. Throughout her set, there
  was only one song that stuck out as an interesting and unique
  thing (passingly honest as well) and that was "Snowflake." It's
  fitting that the song was preceded by an ironic intro about how
  she's lived in California for a long time, but she hates warm
  weather, sounds impossible, but she must be truthful because it's
  the only song that breaks out of the leaden grunge guitar mix and
  hits the audience over the head with songcraft. I'm sure she has
  potential for the future, but I think on her next album she
  should take a hint from Beth Orton who's known previous to her
  most recent album for being a popular artist in the realm of trip
  hop. Stripping down your sound brings the utmost fundamentals of
  your idea and sound out, and I think that could be helpful for

  they hit rock bottom with this one. The 2 stars is 1 because it

  Can he please be institutionalized? I admit the pictures were

  unscientific baloney around page 30. All in all, I just don't

  you are just looking for fun and imaginative creatures. But in
  that case, why restrict your mind with the laws of evolution? Why

  <Text category="book">Mr. Dennett's book demonstrates the ignorance,
  irrationality, and dishonesty of humanists. Discussing the
  meaning of word materialsim, Professor Dennett says: "In its
  scientific or philosophical sense, it refers to a theory that
  aspires to explain all the phenomena without recourse to anything
  immaterial--like a Cartesian soul, or "ectoplasm"--or God. The
  standard negation of materialistic in the scientific sense is
  dualistic, which maintains that there are two entirely different
  kinds of substance, matter and ...whatever minds are supposedly
  made of." (p. 302) Philosophers stopped believing in dualism a
  thousand years ago with the development of metaphysics. A modern
  view is that man is an indefinability that becomes conscious of
  its own existence. The philosophy that God does not exist is not
  materialism, it is naturalism. Materialism is the view that all
  that exists is matter. Materialists frequently say that free will
  is an illusion and that the experience of the existence of
  oneself is some kind of epiphenomena. (In a quote below, you will
  see that Dennett puts free will in a list of things people belief
  in.) It is not clear from the book whether Dennett is a
  materialist, but he is certainly a naturalist. Concerning the
  proof of God's existence, he trots out David Hume's "Who made
  God?" which is based on a misunderstanding of the principle of
  causality. I refer the reader to my personal website for my
  version of the proof. Let's look at two quotes, the first is at
  the end of the chapter "Belief in Belief" and the other at the
  beginning of the chapter "Morality and Religion": "That is, isn't
  it true that, whether or not God exists, religious belief is at
  least as important as the belief in democracy, in the rule of
  law, in free will? The very widespread (but far from universal)
  opinion is that religion is the bulwark of morality and meaning."
  (p. 245) " Without the divine carrot and stick, goes this
  reasoning, people would loll about aimlessly or indulge their
  basest desires, beak their promises, cheat on their spouses,
  neglect their duties, and so on. There are two well-known
  problems with this reasoning: (1) it doesn't seem to be true,
  which is good news, since (2) is is such a demeaning view of
  human nature." (p. 279) In the first chapter, he mentions
  "bulwark of morality" and "meaning." But in the second chapter,
  he leaves out "meaning." If our purpose in life is not to get to
  heaven, what is our purpose is life? Whether religion supports
  morality can be determined by observing whether there is a
  correlation of moral conduct with religious belief. Mr. Dennett
  makes such a correlation to the detriment of religion by citing
  the high divorce rate of fundamentalist Christians. There are
  worse things than divorcing your spouse. Disingenuousness can be
  worse and can take the form of leaving unsaid what should have
  been said. Mr. Dennett should have explained why he did not
  discuss the idea that religion gives meaning to life. The only
  miracle mentioned in Mr. Dennett's book is the Shroud of Turin,
  which has on it a mysterious image of a crucified man. Since no
  one claims to know how the image got there, it can be called a
  miracle. However, Mr. Dennett does not tell us anything about it.

  I found it to be dark, depraved, disgusting, and depressing! An

  <Text category="book">I was extremely disappointed with "After

  Brad Davis. His homosexuality, or perhaps bisexuality, is
  mentioned only in passing, and anyone in New York or Hollywood
  that knew him will tell you that this was a huge part of his
  life. I guess a book written by his wife can't be expected to
  delve too deeply into this area, but even other interesting
  details - his drug addiction, his acting technique, etc. are only
  minimally suggested here. I wanted to put the book down after two
  chapters, but kept waiting for it to get interesting. I suggest
  the publishers retitle the book "My Life with Brad Davis - The
  Saga Of A Wife Kept In The Dark", or something similar, to
  indicate to readers that this book is about Susan Bluestein, and
  tells very little about Brad</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I really tried to come to this movie with and
  open mind. I'm a huge fan of Jane Austen and I thought the 1995
  BBC miniseries actually came close to doing justice to her novel.
  Still, I was looking foreward to seeing a new interpretation.
  Unfortunately this one seemed to miss the point of the story.
  Jane Austen had a hilarious way of satarizing the social
  conventions and mores while being in their midst. This film
  ignores the social conventions altogether and therefore misses a
  great deal of Austen's humor. For example an unmarried man and
  woman would NEVER greet each other in their pajamas. A man would
  never visit his fiancee while she was lying sick in bed in her
  nightgown. When these rules of propriety are ignored by the film,
  how are we supposed to understand or believe that it's a big deal
  when Lydia runs away with Wickham!? Another example is Lady
  Catherine. This is a woman who lives and dies by her snobbery and
  rigorous adherance to social conventions. Yet in this film we see
  her barge into the Bennet household in the middle of the night
  and wake Lizzie up to ask a question that could easily waited
  until morning (when Lady Catherine wouldn't have had to get her
  carriage driver out of bed to drive several miles in the dark- no
  streetlights remember- to the Bennet household) Because no one
  adhere's to societies rigorous, and for the most part arbitrary,
  rules, the movie misses the opportunies to subtly wink at the
  audience as it laughs at such things. Another weakness lies in
  the casting. Granted these actors had big shoes to fill. Colin
  Firth and Jennifer Ehle seemed to embody their characters in the
  1995 miniseries, but as I said, there are other ways to interpret
  and play the characters. Unforunately here everyone seems as if
  they're reading lines with dramatic inflection- not acting. You
  can almost imagine Keira Knightly's script having notes saying
  "insert spunkiness here". While the scenery is lovely, the
  windswept cliff and farm images seem to recollect the tortured
  landscape of a Bronte adaptation more than a manacured Austen
  setting. Overall this film comes off as one big missed
  opportunity</Text>
  <Text category="book">Let me first say that once upon a time I liked
  Larry The Cable Guy. After reading this book, I now think he is
  one step above slime. To be fair, some jokes ARE funny and some
  stories ARE enjoyable and amusing. He is anti-PC which is totally
  fine with me and even goes as far to pick on some appropriate
  targets like Rosie O'Donnell, Michael Moore, Barney Frank,
  Barbara Streisand, and "that fat girl from the Dixie Chicks",
  among others. No problem there in my opinion. That is the
  entirety of the positive things I can say about the book. The
  rest is just babble, often repeated over and over again, that
  even Larry lovers will find annoying. A couple things that really
  bothered me. The first is his constant and unrelenting picking on
  and making jokes at the expense of "retards" and Down's Syndrome
  children. He must use the term "retard" at least fifty+ times in
  the book. This is appreciably different than making a joke about,
  say, Michael Moore. Moore made the decisions and taken the
  actions in his life to make him an apt target for jokes. The
  Down's Syndrome children did not. My opinion of Larry The Cable
  Guy dropped to zero or below after reading his attack on
  "retards". He also racially sterotypes in the book. Many of these
  jokes can be funny if taken in context and at least those people
  can respond. The Down's Syndrome kids can't. Larry, I can only
  hope God (in whom you so mightly believe in according to your
  book) grants you a "retard" child to love and care for. Then, I
  would like to read your next book. I suspect you would gain some
  sorely needed wisdom very quickly. The second theme in the book
  that came through loud and clear is that Larry is a fraud in many
  senses. He plays the good 'ol Bubba. He ain't too bright and he
  ain't ever changed since he left the farm. His "celebrity" - his
  word not mine - has not gone to his head. OK, Larry. Why then the
  better than thou tone throughout the book - including speeches
  and lectures, including serious topics such as abortion? Why do
  virtually every one of your stories and jokes involve putting
  someone else down? Why the unrelenting references to your
  "celebrity"? The terms "meet and greet" and "after-party" were
  used over and over and over, as an example. Do you really think
  your fans have ever been to one of these events or even know what
  they are? Well, you are wrong. They are mentioned constantly to
  remind everyone how big of a star you have become. That's
  Hollywood-speak my country, fart loving, nose picking friend.
  Overall, this book is a true disappointment and Larry The Cable
  Guy is a true moron (see doesn't that sound better than
  "retard"). My Father always taught me there are two types of dumb
  people. Those who are dumb and know they are dumb. And those who
  are dumb but are so dumb, they don't realize it. The former
  category usually shuts up (knowing they are dumb). The latter
  category normally rambles on and on like some drunk in the
  gutter. The first group is obviously smarter than the second.
  Larry The Cable Guy falls smack dab in the last group. The fact
  that he has stumbled into some sense of success is fueling his
  rambling and babbles in this book. Make jokes, Larry, and forget
  about your opinions on say abortion and the like. Unfortunately,
  Larry can't see the obvious. Like virtually every celebrity he
  cites and makes fun of in the book, he has become exactly one of
  them. A thin layer of "Good 'Ol Boy" on top, covering a core of
  venom and "celebrity". He plays the role pretty good until one
  gets under the sheets. My suggestion: Don't buy Larry's act and,
  by all means, don't buy the book.</Text>
  <Text category="book">This is one of the silliest books I have read
  for a long time. It could be categorised as belonging to the same
  genre of "action fantasy" as a number of Hollywood films.
  Examples of the rules of reality being abandoned: The action
  takes place in the middle of Antarctic winter, and the author
  even notes at one point how it's pitch dark outside, yet there
  are scenes on the ice that play out as if the characters could
  see each other. People spend minutes in freezing water, yet pop
  out none the worse for the wear. Two close allies of the United
  States attack a US installation on no better motivation than a
  claim that a "spaceship" has been found there, shouted once
  through the radio. A 12-year-old girl goes through hours of
  commando troops shooting at each other in a closed facility
  without getting hurt physically, nor, apparently, mentally. A
  prototype airplane that has been buried in ice for over ten
  years, but that works perfectly on the first attempt to fly it.
  The stupidity goes on and on, but that's perhaps enough to give a
  taste. There are perhaps people who do not care about any of
  this, but I don't enjoy books whose author doesn't have one bit
  of interest in any sort of realism</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Black Hawk Down hasn't got an interesting
  story on offer. When a bunch of marines is stranded in Mogadishu,
  Somalia all hell breaks loose as militants start attacking them.
  From there it is just angry men running and shooting. Although
  this is what you would expect from a war movie, Black Hawk Down
  remains way below average. I think this movie could have done
  better with some obvious main characters. Now you barely get a
  chance to start caring about what happens to the soldiers. Now
  you have so many qualified actors doing nothing but firing guns.
  As this movie was based on events that truly took place, probably
  Americans will appreciate Black Hawk Down a little more.

  will barely stay together after a few plays. the jewelery,
  subpar. the crown and rings are OK, the rest very cheap and

  <Text category="book">Warner Bros is putting out a series of
  "Signature Collections". They are nothing of the sort. They are
  studio collections. The word signature implies the best of the
  best. A signature collection of Hitch's work would not include
  several of these titles. The rarely seen Foreign Correspondent
  and I Confess. The failed comedy Mr. &amp;amp; Mrs. Smith. The
  experimental Dial M for Murder and The Wrong Man. The middling
  Stage Fright. Only Strangers on a Train and North By Northwest
  are signature Hitchcock. Where are Psycho, Vertigo, The Birds,
  Rear Window, Notorious, Shadow of a Doubt, Rebecca, The 39 Steps,
  The Lady Vanishes and, purhaps even, The Lodger? A signature
  collection would include all or most of these titles with North
  by Northwest and Strangers on a Train. Of course this would
  oblidge the different studios to cooperate with each other. God
  forbid. Warner Bros is developing a reputation for shortchanging
  and lying to its customers. You're much better off buying your
  favorite Hitchcock titles individually new or used</Text>
  <Text category="music">I love this show! That said, I do not care for
  this version of it. The inclusion of the word "concept" in the
  title means it is just that. This was, thankfully, not the final
  version of the show that would later spawn the hit song, "One
  Night In Bangkok". With most Broadway musicals, the musical
  numbers tell the basic story of the show. If you listen to the
  recordings of Phantom, Mama Mia, Beauty and the Beast, you can
  discern the basic storyline of the show. Listening to this
  particular recording of Chess, though, will leave you wondering
  "What was that?" The Broadway arrival of Chess saw a much needed
  reworking of the storyline and arrangement of the musical
  numbers. This recording seems too much like a mish-mash of songs
  that don't really relate to each other. For musical fanatics
  (like myself), I say "yes, you should have this recording in your
  collection", if only to understand how much work went into the
  show before it opened on Broadway. If you are only buying the
  album because of "One Night In Bangkok", purchase the Broadway
  recording instead; you'll be much happier with the performance by
  Phillip Casnoff rather than Murray Head</Text>

  combo as thoroughly as these guys have. I feel like I need a bath
  after just looking at their picture. As far as the "music" is
  concerned, the singing is awful(deadpan monotone voice), the
  instrumentation is very limited, and the overall production is
  2nd rate. The ONLY plus, if any, is that the band manages to show
  some progression on the newer material, which is still not very
  good. The fact that this band has been successful over the years
  just proves that a lot of people have REALLY bad taste.</Text>

  <Text category="book">I had to read this book for a political theory
  class in college. After talking with several other members I was
  happy to find out that I do not have the reading skills of a
  third grader...Benhabib goes out of her way to use vocabulary
  words that most educated people are not familiar with. The book
  is also not organized well. In order to really understand this
  book you will have to read it while taking notes. Points that
  could be grouped together for arguments are scattered throughout
  entire chapters and even the whole book. Benhabib may have used
  her vocabulary and lack of organization as tools to hide that the
  points she makes are not very well argued. Throughout much of the
  book Benhabib is trying to shoot down the theories of John Rawls
  and other theorists to support her views on migratory rights. To
  be honest, I disagree with her views and admit that I might have
  found her organization and vocabulary more tolerable if I agreed
  with her. Still, I do not have a problem with her making these
  claims if she did so logically. Much of her work is based on
  telling the reader why other people are wrong and she will use
  theories she supposedly already disproved in one arguement to
  justify her later arguments for disagreeing with other theories.
  In short, I do not think anyone would want to read this book for
  pleasure, or intellectual curiosity. If you have to read The
  Rights of Others for a class, I extend my condolences.</Text>
  <Text category="book">This book is trying too hard to emphasize in

  few samples, the reading becomes stifling, knowing that you are
  not going to learn anything new that other magic books cannot

  blends magician bios and history within. But one can do better

  <Text category="dvd">I was very disappointed with this film. The
  premise was really intriguing, with Elvis switching places with
  an Elvis impersonator who as we all know goes on to die at
  Graceland leaving the real Elvis to scratch out a living as -
  what else - an Elvis "impersonator." And now, at the end of The
  King's life, he's a semi-invalid in a nursing home being attacked
  by a killer zombie mummy. Since it's Texas, the mummy has a more
  than passing resemblance to Stevie Ray Vaughn. And oh, yeah, JFK
  is also in this nursing home, having inexplicably been
  transformed into Ozzie Davis. How can you miss with a setup like
  this? Well, for starters by assuming the premise is so funny
  there's no real need to provide any additional comedy. The movie
  is flat, with very little humor. As other reviewers have noted,
  it moves at a glacial pace, even allowing for the protagonists
  being 80-somethings who don't move like they used to. Sure, the
  acting is several notches above the norm for a low budget film,
  but there's no point in making a comdey that isn't funny. Nice
  try, but booooooooooring. Not at all recommended.</Text>
  <Text category="music">I know, I know - I never thought it possible
  either, that Gwen Stefani could produce something more awful than
  anything her (ex?) band No Doubt and reduced to house-husband
  Gavin Rosdale's band Bush ever could combined. Take No Doubt's
  attempts at reggae, their use of guitars and trumpets (together?
  Never good), take.. well, every Bush song ever recorded and
  "Hollaback Girl" is STILL a hundred times worse. Let's talk about
  WHY. First of all, that fake music thing I hate. If you've read
  any of my previous reviews (and if not, why not?) you'll know
  that if someone is singing something, even if they've written it
  or not, you've got to BELIEVE it. I mean, Aretha Franklin didn't
  write "Respect" (Otis Redding did), but when she sings it - you
  believe it. Not so with this, a laughable attempt at a
  football-chant soundalike. Here, Gwen tells us that "uh-huh, this
  my s**t" and "this s**t is bananas". And then helpfully spells
  out bananas, all under a "Hey Mickey" type repetitive drumbeat.
  Gwen attempts to sound a number of things.. a) 17 b) black c)
  "street" d) like she had any idea what the hell a "hollaback
  girl" actually WAS until someone told her a week before the song
  was written. She fails on all accounts. What she DOES come across
  as being is everything that, well, she is. A white, 35 year old
  rich married woman bringing in expensive young talent to help her
  sell albums. It's not only an unconvinving song, but a crass,
  ugly, tedious NOISE. But it has the word "s**t" repeated loads
  and loads of times, so of course it sold by the bucketload. Sigh
  and double sigh. I shudder to think what she'll come up with next
  to top it. Gwen Gangsta Rap?

  <Text category="dvd">I've been a longtime fan of Seagal's movies,
  but I was greatly disappointed by this film. First, there were
  clearly sections where Steven Seagal's voice was done by a
  different actor who sounds nothing like him. (Clearly done when
  the film was cut together after the main filming) It was
  surprising that they could not take the time to get Seagal to do
  the vocal tracks for those sections. There were also very few
  action sequences that demonstrated Seagal's skills with martial
  arts. In many ways, this film was more of a slasher flick than an
  action film. Little action, but lots of bloody corpses lying

  deals with a woman who has an accident and is "touched" by a sex

  and the music are way beyond "below average." There is next to no

  <Text category="dvd">Therese, Lux, Mary, Bonnie and Cecilia make up
  the five Lisbon girls, ages 13, 14, 15, 16 and 17. Cecilia, the
  youngest, lives in her sisters shadows because they are all older
  and of much more interest to their male neighbors. As a cry for
  help, she slits her wrists and lays down in the bathtub, she
  survived the incident. After a psychiatrist highly impresses upon
  the strict Mr. and Mrs. Lisbon that it would be benificial for
  Cecilia to be exposed to environments which have boys her own
  age, Mr. and Mrs. Lisbon decide to allow the girls to throw the
  one and only Lisbon party. Some of the neighborhood's boys are
  invited over and while the party is in session, Cecilia is pretty
  inanimate, sitting on the couch while her sisters flirt, talk and
  laugh. Midway through the party, Cecilia asks to be excused and
  Mrs. Lisbon - though somewhat reluctantly - allows it. Cecilia
  goes up to her room (on the second floor of a two-story house)
  and jumps out the window, landing on the spiked fence on the
  front lawn of the Lisbon house. In this way, Cecilia Lisbon
  commited suicide. Only four girls remain. The act which Cecilia
  committed did not go at all unnoticed. The father saw her
  immediately, the party ended there and all of the boys went home
  rather glum. Four of the Lisbon's neighbors, four young boys,
  suffered a rapidly growing obsession with the Lisbon girls, who
  were beautiful and a total mystery to the outside world. They got
  hold of Cecilia's diary and tried to explain why she committed
  suicide. The eldest decided Cecilia was a dreamer, and she did
  not think she would fall when she jumped out her window, she
  thought she would fly. With their youngest sister gone, the
  remaining Lisbon girls grow closer to each other, stranding
  themselves further from the outside world. When school starts
  again, they attempt to go on acting as if nothing happened, not
  ever mentioning their youngest sister. The run-of-the-mill
  awkward act is taken part by the rest of the school however. The
  usual profuse apology to the mention of the word "death" and the
  like. Trip Fontaine is the most popular guy in school, the object
  of desire to all of the girls at school... Except for the Lisbon
  girls, which is of no importance to Trip until he sets eyes on
  Lux. Trip cannot help but be enchanted by her flawless beauty. In
  the beginning, he is unsuccessful in his quest to even catch her
  attention for she bluntly shows she's not interested. But after
  his consistent courtship, Lux falls for his charming ways. Trip
  then attempts to convince Mr. Lisbon to let him and three of his
  football team pals take the Lisbon daughters to Homecoming. After
  Mr. Lisbon talks to his wife, he agrees to Trip's request,
  knowing nothing but Trip's sincerity and claimed honorable
  intentions, on the understanding that Trip have all of the Lisbon
  girls returned to the house by curfew. After Trip explains the
  situation to his football peers, he gives in to those who bribe
  him the most handsomely. Meanwhile, the Lisbon girls are picking
  out fabric for the dresses they shall wear to the Homecoming
  Dance. Though one pattern is used for all four dresses, each
  dress looks unique when concentrating on detail. Once they pick
  up the girls, they stop midway to the Homecoming in order to
  smoke, Lux being the only girl volunteering to smoke. They then
  drive to the dance. Trip and Lux sneak away and sneak swallows of
  alcohol. Another one of the Lisbon sisters and her date follow,
  but leave soon afterwards, not being as wild nor daring as Trip
  and Lux. At the time they all decided to meet back at the car so
  they could make the girls curfew, they are all there... Except
  for Trip and Lux, who at that time were alone in the middle of
  the football stadium field. Deciding they must make their own
  curfews, Therese, Bonnie, Mary and their dates leave without
  them. After fooling around, the intoxicated Trip and Lux fall
  asleep in the middle of the football stadium. Trip awakens in the
  middle of the night and leaves Lux there alone. When Lux wakes up
  early the next morning she is confused as to why Trip is not
  there. She takes a taxi home and her parents were worried sick
  (of course). But they take measures as far as pulling the girls
  out of school and stranding them inside the Lisbon residence. The
  girls, in a desperate attempt to hold onto a connection to the
  outside world, begin using morse code to interact with the four
  boys who so closely follow their lives. One of which boys lived
  across the street and the rest which came over daily after this
  in order to contact the girls. Soon following, the boys begin
  talking to the Lisbon girls via phone. One day, the girls invite
  the boys to come over once Mr. and Mrs. Lisbon are asleep. The
  plan being that the boys were to drive the girls somewhere, the
  boys hastily agree. They sneak over and Lux invites them to wait
  inside for her sisters and Lux goes to wait in the car. The boys
  wander down to the basement while waiting for Therese, Bonnie and
  Mary, verbally expressing their hopes for the night. But then
  they realize they have stumbled upon one of the sisters. She had
  hung herself. The boys, scared to death, run all the way home.
  Time passed, things changed, girls came and went... But no matter
  what, those four boys NEVER forgot the Lisbon suicides.
  Ultimately, the movie was nothing short of queer. When trying to
  sum up the story in a few lines (such as "Follow the lives of the
  Lisbon sisters and how they connect to their neighbors. A story
  full of obsession, gossip, lust, love, desire and isolation.")
  the story sounds quite unique and intriguing, but the story fell
  short of that for me personally. Partly because the Lisbon
  sisters really committed suicide for a reason not much deeper
  than isolation. The movie, in places, is also extremely flawed. I
  do not believe Mr. and Mrs. Lisbon could've removed their
  daughters from school for so long without their daughters being
  taken from them by social services. In many parts of the movie,
  they should've used upbeat music to fill the deafening silences.
  The whole movie was filmed in a style that I can truthfully say
  makes me rather bored. I would only suggest this film to,
  perhaps, people who like movies such as "Elizabethtown" which
  Kirsten Dunst is also in. But I personally disliked this movie
  which was not very tasteful and will not be watching it again in
  the future</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">I think I understand what Camp is. "The
  Damned" is a film taking upon itself the allegorical rise and
  fall of Nazi Germany in such an overindulgent manner that one
  cringes and giggles at the same time. I guess Gay folks
  everywhere can blame Luchino Visconti the "great" director for
  making a laughing stock out of homosexuals in Nazi SS garb. Mel
  Brooks realized in his film "The Producers" that Nazi's are damn
  funny, but not even Brook's vision could foresee the downfall of
  the Essenbeck family as the currents of early Nazi bloodshed
  swirls about. The uniforms are Art Deco at its worst. The young
  blonde, Aryan, cross-dressers are a bathhouse dream until they're
  lined up against the wall. Rome may have had Caligula, but The
  Reich had blonde pedophiles. What a thrill to see Helmut Berger
  swishing about in Marlene Dietrich bodice and stockings. I
  watched the whole thing and I'm going to end this review to take
  a shower</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I bought this shopping cart for my
  grandaughters age 22 and 23 months old. They love pushing it
  around without the baby seat, without the basket. In other words
  they are quite adept at taking it apart &amp;amp; rolling around
  the frame. The doll is difficult to put in, the cardboard
  groceries were put away until they are older. The other groceries
  are fine, the pouring milk container is great as are the pretend
  veggies &amp;amp; mac n cheese. They both put them in the
  containers. I am disappointed and was looking for a shopping cart
  that my own daughters had, that actually looks like a cart
  &amp;amp; doesn't disassemble so easily</Text>
  <Text category="book">Although I have only read a few specific
  subjects in this book, I am only giving it 1 start because the
  information in the section on hyperemesis is extremely inaccurate
  and perpetuates outdated myths about this very serious and
  life-threatening disease. For anyone who has had hyperemesis
  gravidarum (HG), reading that a spa day would be beneficial, is
  not only absurd, but also insulting. Many women with HG cannot
  get to another room of the house without help, much less drive a
  car to a spa! HG is a disease and not a psychological condition.
  Women cannot stop the disease at will. This myth has resulted in
  a century of poor and sometimes abusive treatment of these
  afflicted women, causing excessive and unnecessary stress and
  misery, not to mention preventable complications during pregnancy
  and in their resulting children. Some women have life-long
  effects. (...</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">We bought this item for my Daughter's
  Christmas present and the strings do not work at all. All it does
  is play the 3 songs, and the microphone works. But the other
  functions (anything to do with the strings) do not work at all.
  We bought this at Toys R Us and we're taking it back tomorrow. As
  I can see from the reviews (which I wish I'd read earlier), we'll
  be getting a different brand of guitar. These seem faulty as a

  <Text category="dvd">Not what I expected when renting this movie.
  As others have said Clarissa came off too pure and innocent.
  Futhermore, I don't understand why such a viriginal woman would
  run off to be with one of the most horrid men in the world?
  Everyone knows what Lovelace has done..there are numerous
  accounts. Yet she goes with him anyway? Blah. The acting was OK.
  The costumes were excellent(I love period movies) but the plot
  dragged and dragged and dragged. And as another put it, I was
  very glad when Clarissa kicked the bucket. I read a lot of
  historical fiction, classic novels and love period movies, but
  there was no liking this one. It just couldnt be done</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">My boyfriend and I went to this movie we both
  hated it. It was really pathetic. Perhaps the fact that we
  actually know men who are engineers and physicsts who are like
  this is part of it. Yeah there are people who cannot interact
  with women or people. It is pathetic. I would feel sorry for
  anywoman dating this man or any man like this because they lack
  confidence and are so hard to deal with. Low self esteem. Do you
  want to see a pathetic portion of the population yeah this is
  them there are actually people like this. Perhaps it is funny,
  but just do not be around one of these people in reality. It is a
  painful reminder of how screwed up they are. Not all men are
  virgins like this man, but some might as well be because they
  have no clue about women. they do not know how to open a door or
  hold a hand.</Text>
  <Text category="book">I was quite disappointed by this book, I was
  expecting something with more professional level content. It's
  all very amateur however, the artwork used in the examples is
  sub-professional at best. I was hoping that the book would deal
  with some of the specific Pre-Press issues relating to comics
  artwork, but the chapter there was frustratingly slight. You
  would be much better to buy a a more general pre-press book. The
  quality of the packaging and printing were also quite poor for a
  book that cost this much</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">As the other reviewers make clear, this is a
  disturbing film in that the college girl forced into prostitution
  ends up by developing feelings for the man who "ruined" her. So
  you may immediately assume that the director has a deeper comment
  to make beyond this trite observation. Problem is, having just
  watched the movie, I am not convinced there is anything below the
  surface. Prostitution is a fact of life in Asian cities, the
  theme of women overcome by their desires and in thrall to strong
  men a common one, and I searched in vain for any subversion of or
  challenge to that fantasy (as fantasy it is). Is this any more
  than a homage to the inutility of futility? Not that I can
  see</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I bought this for my daughter when she was 2.
  I agree with the other reviewer about the weight of the product.
  It is so heavy that it can actually hurt a child if it turns
  over. I still let my daughter play with it but only when she's
  being supervised around it. And I have to make sure that the toy
  is not on any type of unstable ground. There are other good shape
  sorters out there - I wouldn't waste the money on this one
  because of the potential safety hazard.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Okay, I gave a pretty bad review of this dvd
  originally because it didn't play right. But after viewing it
  without the technical problems, I would like to say that it is a
  pretty good program and given the rarity of the subject matter, a
  good addition to any collection. Ancient muscle conditioning? Not
  many dvd's out there on the subject. I've edited my original
  review and it won't allow me to give it more stars, but I'd give
  it 4. Sorry, Mr. Keen, if I cost you sales on this. I commend you
  for putting this out</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My son LOVES to "drive" cars. I saw this and
  thought he would love it. It is totally unrealistic, doesnt make
  much noise (which for some parents that would be a +, but in this
  case its not) and it is not entertaining at all. Paid entirely
  tooooo much money for something that he will not play with at
  all. I have tried letting some of my friends children play with
  it, and they dont seem to enjoy it either.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I picked this up on clearance, but I still
  think I spent too much. The older versions were made of much
  sturdier material; the cards the questions are printed on are
  very flimsy compared to the original game. The questions are
  okay, but many are very obscure. Trivial Pursuit is a great game
  and it's one of my favorites, but this version is a dud. Save
  your money if you have the older version; it's still a lot more
  fun to play</Text>
  <Text category="health">Returned right after I tried it... does not
  get hot AT ALL. Very disappointed since it is so expensive</Text>
  <Text category="book">Two huge problems with this book. One, this
  self righteous club is leaving clues to a killer and "traveling
  and learning" when they already know his identity, so I guess he
  can keep on dismembering women until the psychiatrist figures it
  all out and then gets teary eyed over his new special wine glass.
  Two, the city of Los Angeles functions as a character in
  Kellerman's other novels and adds alot of realism to the novels.
  This thing drags on in some unnamed, nondescript city</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">The movies and stories are classic westerns,
  the quality is horrible, these are not remastered. It looks like
  they found the oldest copy of the film and transfered it to DVD.

  <Text category="health">I was surprised to find positive reviews for
  this heating pad, since I just returned mine after one use.
  Perhaps the one I got was defective, but even on the highest
  setting this heating pad was barely warm to the touch and wasn't
  hot enough to penetrate my sore back muscle. I also thought that
  the convenience of strapping the pad on would be excellent to
  target the lower back area, and found the shape of the pad and
  the flimsy elastic strap provided to be very uncomfortable to
  wear. The placement of the strap doesn't allow the pad to conform
  to the body, but only to press against it where the strap runs
  through - just the center, not the rest of the pad. I realize
  there are probably now safety standards for heating pads that
  preclude them from getting too warm, but hopefully they are not
  so stringent as to not allow any electric heating device from
  getting warm enough to penetrate sore muscles properly. For the
  time being I'll keep wearing Thermacare(TM) back wraps (which are
  expensive - could have bought two heating pads by now) but do
  last 8 hours at a time and provide intense enough heat. Also,
  this disposable product is surprisingly comfortable to wear and
  more directly applies heat to the area where I need it. If you
  need intense heat for a sore back, I'd skip this heating
  pad</Text>

  <Text category="music">Although it KILLS me to write anything less
  than glowing about Edwin McCain (I think he's probably the most
  talented singer/songwriter we've seen in the last ten years), I
  just can NOT get into this album. Like others have said, I too
  have every Edwin album and have seen him in concert. I love
  everything he's ever done.... but this album just doesn't do it
  for me. And I know people will say... "Give the album a
  chance"..... or... "Let Edwin grow and move in new musical
  directions". BUT..... I've listened to this album at least 10
  times all the way through and it's just not growing on me. It
  feels "flat" and just doesn't feel EDWIN-ISH (if that makes any
  sense). Even Grammercy Park Hotel, which I saw him debut live and
  which is on his live DVD doesn't feel the same on here.... just
  doesn't have the feeling or soul. I would pick up Austin Sessions
  over this album any day. THAT is Edwin doing what he does best.
  Maybe he feels the pressure to write some "hits" so that he
  doesn't have to spend two solid years on the road in the Black
  Pearl (his tour bus)..... and who could blame him??? But this
  feels like he's trying too hard. I SOOOOOO hope he comes back
  with a better album next time, so I can rave about it, because
  although I gave this album 2 stars.... Edwin, as a
  person/singer/performer/songwriter deserves 10!!!!!!</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">We bought this dollhouse, because when we went
  to the store, it had an adorable display and looked like a step
  up from the Twintime Dollhouse, which has very small rooms. You
  could press the button on the display, and the people would talk
  to each other. My kids thought it would be great. When we were at
  Toys R Us, I looked for accessory furniture/people/animal sets to
  go along with this dollhouse. I did not see any. I thought it was
  probably due to Christmas just having passed. We got home, opened
  the dollhouse and discovered that there really were not many
  phrases that the provided people/furnitureanimal did, so I went
  to Amazon to try to find more sets in order to achieve the
  purpose of this dollhouse (to get the 200 phrases). Thats when
  reality set in that we had just made a huge mistake. You cannot
  find ANY accesory pieces for this set. You can go on Ebay and pay
  many times more than the original price for USED furniture. I was
  really disappointed. I even tried the Fisher Price website, only
  to find that they are marketing the Twintime Dollhouse furniture
  for this Sweet Sounds Dollhouse. What a shame and a sham.... I
  really like Fisher Price toys and we have many, but I am very
  disappointed in the fact that they are trying to fool the
  consumer. What good is a dollhouse, if you cannot get it to
  accomplish what it says it will do---200 phrases. Not to mention,
  what is included with the Sweet Sounds Dollhouse is not much.
  Just a Mom, Dad, girl, baby, swing, cradle, radio, cat, and a
  scant few more pieces. Definately not enough to keep the kids
  interested for long! There are actually three Fisher Price
  dollhouses that are still available, this one, the Twintime
  Dollhouse, and the one we eventually ended up buying at Value
  City (also available on Ebay)--the Fisher Price Special Edition
  Townhouse. It has a doorbell that rings, doors that open, birds
  that sing, phone that rings, lights that come on, fridge light
  comes on, computer lights up(and is part of a desk set attached
  to the dollhouse), and a fireplace that crackles and lights up
  (which is also attached to the dollhouse). These things are all
  ON THE DOLLHOUSE itself. No accesory furniture or people are
  needed to make this happen. The battery replacement compartment
  is on the back on this dollhouse not the bottom, like the Sweet
  Sounds one. The front of the Townhouse has flower boxes with
  likelike flowers you place in them (comes with the set). You can
  get it A LOT cheaper than the Sweet Sounds Dollhouse, too (almost
  half the cost). It comes with a great deal of furniture: 2 beds
  with pillows and comforters and blankets, a lawnchair, 3 people,
  potted plant, real curtains, kitchen table and chairs, clothing
  for the people, computer chair, lounge chair and more. The
  kitchen counter, stove, microwave and fridge are part of the
  dollhouse. It also has closet doors that open and stairs the
  people can walk up. You practically do not need to buy anything
  else, but if you do, you can get the Loving Family accesory
  people and furniture sets. This dollhouse is so much larger to
  boot. There is plenty of room to put everything. It shuts and
  closes together just like the Sweet Sounds, but it is clearly
  larger. We also thought about the Twintime, but it had too many
  comments on how small the rooms were and the display at Toys R Us
  looked jammed packed. I did not know how more than one child
  could play with it and not have a shoving match, because they
  could not play, as well. My kids absolutely the Townhouse with
  all of its sounds, especially the doorbell. The great thing about
  it is that these are greatly reduced in price, because they are
  an older model, which is what they should do with the Sweet
  Sounds Dollhouse. Let the public know ahead of time, so their
  kids do not get disappointed, because it does not live up to what
  it says at the store. Thank Goodness I was able to take mine
  back, because I had my receipt and box. Be careful and keep the
  box and receipt if you do choose to buy this dollhouse even after
  all of the warnings, because after your kids see that it does not
  do what it says and because it is on the small side compared with
  the Townhouse version, they may not want to keep it. When we took
  ours back, a Toys R Us worker stopped and talked to us and agreed
  that Fisher Price is just trying to get rid of their extra stock
  of Sweet Sounds Dollhouses. Unfortunately, it is at the consumers
  expense and disappointment!!</Text>
  <Text category="book">Typical Feinstein ("A Season on the Brink"
  excepted). Quick, gossipy, superficial, fawning, etc., etc. This
  book is about the 2002 U.S. Open Golf Championship at the
  Bethpage Black Golf Course, a New York State Park course on Long
  Island. The subtitle, "Inside the Ropes at Bethpage Black," is
  used here as a figure of speech, meaning "behind the scenes."
  ("Inside the ropes" is normally used in the context of a
  professional golf tournament to refer to the actual playing area
  itself -- spectators are separated from the golfers, caddies,
  officials, and other chosen few by thin ropes that tell the
  spectators how close they can get to the action.) Feinstein's
  purpose is to give the reader a look at the unfolding of a golf
  tournament from its conception to its completion. We see U.S Golf
  Association (the organization that conducts the tournament)
  leaders in action and learn something about the logistics of
  putting on a golf tournament (e.g., 4,850 people willing to
  volunteer their time so that the professional golfers and
  U.S.G.A. can have a huge payday), about random qualifiers and
  random competitors, and about the resurrection of the Black golf
  course. Yet the book does not fulfill its promise. My guess is
  that Feinstein's indebted to too many golf people for both his
  past and anticipated future lifestyle to offer the kind of
  critical insights and analysis I had hoped for</Text>

  painted on, a gold-tone, and the paint looked like it was
  chipping off. The base of the item is separate from the top of
  the item, which seems to be attached with springs? It did run,
  but was very loud, like it was working too hard. There is a note
  not to use it more than 20 minutes, which I'm not sure is because
  of a potential adverse affect with the user, or because the unit
  might overheat. There were some spelling errors on the outside of
  the box (a few places said "reflexology" and a few places said
  "relexology")-- but maybe that just bothers me? I think it is
  also important to note that the buyer pays shipping, and if
  returned -- also pays RETURN shipping charges; and when combined,
  nearly equals the original cost of the item. ;o(</Text>
  <Text category="music">Ok, first off, this is the first Corrs release
  i've listenend to. I'm offering my opinion without knowing
  anything else they may have done. I've listened to the cd 10
  times or so, on random occasions when i need a break from my
  normal diet of punk and garage rock. It sounds good. A little TOO
  good. I agree that it's overproduced, doesn't sound even remotely
  spontaneous. The studio work is well done, but OVERdone. I'd like
  to hear something else to see what they REALLY sound like. The
  content of the songs is what bothers me. Aside from being sappy,
  sentimental drivvel (this is pop music, after all - i wasn't
  expecting anything else), everything sounds like a commercial
  ditty or a part of a movie soundtrack. Mmm-hmm. Track 1 - I see a
  not-so overweight soccermom smiling on a treadmill at Curves(TM),
  then hopping in the Ford Expedition(TM), and cheering on the kids
  at their soccer game with a SunnyD(TM) in each hand. Track 2 -
  Helicopter pans out as mid-20's girl drives curvy mountain road
  in VW Cabrio(TM)(R) with top down, thinking about handsome
  lover... "LMN"(R) watermark in lower-right corner of screen...
  Track 3 - Sad animals. Images of puppys in cages. Track 4 -
  Actually, I like this one. Mellow, laid back. Track 5 - Ugh.
  Track 6 - This one is the MOST clever! I see the band members - 3
  girls, 1 guy - on one side of a table under a hanging lamp in an
  otherwise black room, while 3 gentlemen in suits open a breifcase
  full of money, push it towards them and say, "As you're aware,
  the radio has lost it's credibility. The kids are figuring out
  that there are other bands out there, beside what we pump across
  the airwaves at them. We need to entice them back. If you want a
  single, and this pile of cash says you do, then you'll do what
  you can to save this dying medium. Hell, you work in the word
  "radio" and we'll double what we're giving you." Come on, the
  song even SOUNDS like a PSA for the International Radio Marketing
  Council... Track 7 - Sounds like a Pepsi commercial. Track 8 -
  Ugh. Wait, wasn't this Track 5? Track 9 - Sappy, but ok. Sounds
  like they actually put effort into the lyrics. Thumbs up. Track
  10 - Not remotely original, but alright. Track 11 - Interesting
  sound. Good beat. Correct me if i'm worng, but was that a
  semi-Pagan reference there? That would be a bold move, for which
  i'd applaud them, if in fact it is. Not that i'm Pagan or
  anything, but hey, its a religiously positive, non-Christian
  reference that doesn't involve Marilyn Manson, and that takes
  guts. Especially for radio-loving girls bands. Track 12 - Laid
  back. Almost has a jazzy, lounge feel. Track 13 - Produced by
  former Ace of Base member? Bubbly, upbeat, not too bad. Track 14
  - Written and produced by Avril Lavigne... Track 15 - WOW! A
  RELATIVELY CELTIC-SOUNDING SONG FROM A RELATIVELY CELTIC BAND!!
  And instrumental, too - big thumbs up! In fact, maybe that's the
  key. Whatever. Long-winded, i know, but fair. This album didn't
  turn me off to the Corrs completely, but i don't have very high
  hopes now. Flame away, kiddies.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Bought this for daughter for Christmas, and
  when I opened the box and saw the cardboard backing, debated on
  returning it. But they love the Pegasus Barbies, so figured okay,
  let's try it out! Is really beautiful when all put together, and
  my daughter LOVES it! But, that stupid cardboard backing. Nope,
  no way does it stay on at all. Am going to tape it to the wall
  behind the playset, and it will be fine. Right now is just
  standing up behind the set. Really, couldn't they have made a
  plastic piece with a big sticker with clouds/pegasus horses on it
  that attached to the back? When assembled, the whole thing will
  fall apart if you literally move it a couple inches. My 3-year
  old daughter understands this, not to move it, and so far she has
  been fine with it. I showed her myself moving it and it falling
  apart, and said see, don't move it, okay!? But when it comes
  apart, is very easy to pop the sections back together - which in
  my house, the kids play with toys for a while, and then I like to
  put things away in the closet for a bit - which this I can easily
  break down some of it to store, and then in seconds have it
  snapped back together again to play with. Yes, durability-wise is
  a piece of junk - but a beautiful piece of junk, and is worth it
  if your child loves the Pegasus Barbies</Text>

  <Text category="music">I bought this cd for one song,
  &amp;amp;quot;Walk Away&amp;amp;quot; which was one of their best
  known songs. I was hoping since that particular song was so good
  that maybe the album would harbor a few more gems. There wasn't.
  The rest of the album is like an anti-climax. I would suggest a
  greatest hits instead. If you see this cd just turn your pretty
  head and walk away</Text>
  <Text category="music">This album isn't not very good at all. There
  are about four songs I like. First off, the production on this CD
  is disgusting considering some of the producers make great beats.
  Then, the guest artists do a sub-par job lyrically. Then, there
  are no new verses from Biggie, on the album. They should have
  stopped with Born Again, because album will be a forgotten one,
  not a great way to close out the legecy of Bigge Smalls</Text>
  <Text category="health">You could get the same info on "percentage" of
  body fat by going online. Think about it: how does a scale
  "measure" your body fat? Good question. So I went to the website
  of the manufacturer and...surprise, surprise...there were no
  details about HOW this worked. It did, however, note what it was
  SUPPOSED to detect and how that might connect to body fat. The
  scale supposedly measures something called "electrical impedence"
  which sounds pretty complex but really isn't all that hard to
  understand. All it means is that the more fat you have in your
  body, the more "impedence" you have and the higher the body fat
  reading. Electricity doesn't flow as well through fat and the
  scale is supposed to detect that. BUT HERE IS THE CATCH - getting
  an ACCURATE body fat measurement can not possibly be done by just
  stepping on a scale, especially if the consumer (buyer) of that
  scale doesn't understand the factors that are VITAL to an
  accurate measurement. What you have in your body when you step ON
  the scale is one vital factor. Here is just one example of how
  easy it would be to get a bad reading: If you are dehydrated from
  not drinking enough water or, conversely, you are OVERhydrated
  from drinking too much water or you haven't measured your body
  fat within a certain amount of time AFTER exercise or you've been
  standing too long or you've eaten recently.....you are very
  likely to get an inaccurate reading and you'll be confused by the
  variation in readings from one day to the next, not knowing WHAT
  factor or combination of factors is affecting your reading. Even
  worse, you'll have no real idea of your body fat. From what I've
  seen, these scales do provide accurate weight measurements.But
  when it comes to measuring body fat,the ads or website do not
  seem to indicate that you can get an inaccurate reading if you
  step on the scale at the wrong time of day, too soon after
  exercising, if you are thirsty, etc. So save your money. If you
  are working out regularly, eating right, getting in shape,
  etc....odds are that your body fat is dropping and you'll see
  signs of this. You don't need this scale to prove it (although
  you might consider it worthwhile to discover your actual body fat
  some other way). Signs of reduced body fat are firmer muscles,
  looser clothes and (often) a more streamlined figure. Your
  metabolism is likely to be more efficient, assuming you don't
  overeat too much. If you absolutely HAVE to know your percentage
  of body fat, just ask your local physician, trainer or gym
  director how to get an accurate assesment and when to do so. If
  you workout regularly at the suggested or peak training level,
  your body fat should go down, assuming you don't compensate by
  eating too much. So don't count on this scale to give you the
  consistency or quality of a detailed and CONTROLLED body fat
  measurement. It won't.</Text>
  <Text category="book">This book contains reproducible mini-books,
  bingo cards, flash cards, some word search puzzles and fill-in
  activities. In my opinion, the fill-ins are a bit too
  challenging. I even had trouble with them. The only thing in this
  book really "worth it" that I couldn't make as well myself, are
  the mini-books. The mini-books each contain several different
  sight words, so they seem to me to be more effective for review
  of words the student has already learned than in the initial
  learning of them</Text>

  <Text category="book">I was eager to read this book, but after
  reading it I was left completely flat. The rest of the iceberg?
  Hardly. Smith barely gives us more than what we could get from
  reading Sports Illustrated, or any Minnesota sports page. He
  admits he's not a fan of football, but for the majority of the
  book leisurely describes the most basic parts of his football
  career. This book is touted as: his full and complete story. So
  we learned he was watching Ren &amp;amp; Stimpy during his NFL
  Draft. Wow, are these the types of meaty stories that we want to
  read? How about telling us more of the inside details... How did
  Smith deal with people who wanted to be his friends or
  girlfriends only because he was a star football player? Who were
  his friends that he could trust, and when did he need that trust?
  What thoughts enter your mind as you look to hire an agent? What
  was he doing when he was "goofing off and missing class all
  summer" which led to one of the most covered stories of his time
  at Ohio State? When, and why did he begin using pot? If football
  is not "smart" enough for him, why doesn't he study and break
  down some of the coaching process that is more mentally
  challenging? What happened to plans for medical school? We know
  the stories of football; those are the parts of the iceberg that
  have already been documented. I also felt Smith wrote this book
  as if he is defending himself from all of America. Who is
  attacking him? Why does he feel the need to explain why he was
  paid so much? Highly paid athlete stories are, sorry for the pun,
  a dime a dozen. He tries to compare his sitting out for more
  money to a scenario for the average guy. The truth is, many
  people will take a job for 5% less than a co-worker because yes,
  they value things other than money, and yes, they are happy to
  have a job. Leaving the grammatical errors to the other
  reviewers, it felt like I was reading an average high school
  creative writing project. 'I did this, I did that, I went to bed,
  next day.' Half of his quotes are from the wellspring of deep
  philosophy: pop music. Smith notes "less than 50 percent of
  Americans read at a 10th-grade level". Well, this book certainly
  won't tax the reading ability of too many people. One lesson from
  this book is that Smith had opportunities to swallow his pride,
  take some coaching, and come up with a better solution. This book
  is another one of those times. He should have hired an editor or
  writing consultant who could give guidance. Build the characters;
  help us feel their stories. Instead, Smith felt it necessary to
  go alone to get to the raw emotions. Sorry, but compared to other
  autobiographies, this was not an emotional book. I'm sure Smith
  is all the things that Mike Gutter says he is, such as:
  thoughtful, honest, trustworthy, dependable, passionate... but I
  felt that some of the best stories that would demonstrate these
  characteristics were left out of this book. Instead, we are still
  looking for the rest of the iceberg.</Text>

  <Text category="music">There's always the argument that if Bach had

  and rejected it as a bad idea, since it so obviously fails to
  serve the paramount musical ideals that inspired the High Baroque
  composers. For listeners who understand what Bach meant by equal
  temperament, it's worth noting that the standard temperament of
  the modern piano bears no close connection to what Bach was
  trying to demonstrate in these "pedagogical" compositions. In

  <Text category="toys_games">My husband and I just bought the Family Feud
  2nd Edition DVD TV Games. I have to say we both LOVED this game
  when it was first on (and on GSN as repeats) and I like the
  computer version. We played this once by ourself and a couple of
  times with friends and we all have found that this game was
  boring &amp;amp; as someone said they can't believe they put this
  out. If you are going to get this game then buy the computer
  version. You have 5 rounds Round #1 Round #2 Double Money Round
  Triple Money Round Fast Money Round You have Team A and Team B.
  If you get one wrong answer and you click wrong then it says go
  for steal. HOWEVER, you only get one X. Per Guide...IF an answer
  is revealed that Team A did not have written down, they press
  Wrong Answer button and pass the remote to Team B. Team B now has
  the opportunity to steal the round. So most of the game was
  passing the remote back and forth. IF the steal answer matches
  any one of the remaining answers they steal the round (even if
  you-Team A had that written down) and takes the money for any
  answer the other team has answered correctly (even if they got 4
  out of 5 and both Teams say have the same answer) The game itself
  was simple and basic. There was no real fun to it. We tried to
  play it with others and they said afterwards that they found it
  boring and not all that fun. One person said they would have more
  fun watching the game itself on TV over playing this version of
  the game. You get two markers (red and blue) to write on the two
  wipe-clean score cards. The negative on this is that the markers
  do not write all that good on these cards even though they were
  meant to. Another thing is that the same game will come up more
  than once. We had the same question and answer come up even
  though we only played twice. This is the 3rd or 4th DVD game we
  have been given or bought. This is the only one where we disliked
  it so much after playing it a couple of times that we are giving
  it away as we will not be playing it again</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">This movie is typical Hollywood anti-war,

  labeled "lumbar", it actually massages your thighs. When you try
  the pre-designed massages ("modes"), the chair vibrates very
  quickly at seemingly random spots. The whole thing is almost
  musical. Whoever designed this chair should try a different
  profession. Besides all this, the chair itself is fairly

  <Text category="book">I picked this book up at my public library
  because I had put it on my reading list a while back when I saw
  that the President(!) of the United States George Bush read it
  while he was on vacation too. I went to my local cofee place and
  got a MEDIUM regular cofee flavored cofee but in a LARGE cup (so
  theres room for plenty of milk which I like and also you only get
  charged for a medium even though its in a large). Anyway I am
  reading this book and it seems okay but then this guy with a
  laptop bumps into my chair where I have rested my cofee which is
  not at all my fault because thats why the chair has a little
  ledge there. So then this guy says he is sorry but that doesnt
  exactly unspil my cofee if you catch my meaning. And he offers to
  pay for a new cofee but it doesnt really matter its the principle
  of the thing. Anyway then he leaves and I notice my copy of the
  book has cofee spilled on it not just my pants as I thought
  previously. So I'm not about to read a book with cofee stains all
  over it so I take it back to the library. Now here I have to
  point out that I had a little incident a couple weeks back with
  the librarian and long story short they lost a book about a
  fireman that I returned and made me pay for it but not without a
  fight. Well you better believe that same librarian who yelled at
  me is watching me now whenever I go in there and she sees that
  cofee stain right off when I turn the book in. I explain that its
  still perfectly good and you can still read it and it wasnt even
  my fault and maybe they should get the $8.50 from the cofee house
  they made the cofee not me. But you can guess how this ended up.
  I am down another $8 dollars and change (I paid the .50 cents in
  pennies I got from the place I keep pennies in the car which got
  me a cross look since I counted them out one by one but it was
  worth it). And I never finished the book since it was ruined.
  But! I liked the parts I read "okay" and if the President likes
  it I guess it gets FOUR STARS only I made it TWO STARS because I
  only read half. Maybe I will read the second half later if that
  librarian retires and then I will come back and give this book
  it's missing TWO STARS if it ends well. Lesson learned is life is
  not always fair but you "keep on keepin on" like they say</Text>
  <Text category="book">Normally I like the entire "female power"
  thing but frankly the "this is wrong" or "evil" part of that
  storyline is really old. In an era where girls do try out for and
  get placed on "boys" teams, these issues seem outdated. Likewise
  rules were recently changed in Indiana (not even slightly a
  liberal state) that says any pageant receiving state funds cannot
  discriminate on the basis of sex or gender. I know, this book is
  from 1999, but we are living in a conservative backlash
  politically and this is still happening, changes are happening.
  Overall I felt the book had a very negative view of the gender
  roles and did not do anything to suggest they should be
  different. Even the disempowered girl who creates the initial
  problems with her "magic" is empowered through a pageant and her
  cooking. How much more gender role enforcement can we have?
  Really, with a strong female lead, shouldn't a Buffy universe
  story do better than this? In general the feel of the
  relationships and lingo between the main characters was fine but
  not particularly outstanding</Text>
  <Text category="health">The razor isn't bad, but the cleaning system

  cleaning solution (which is an expensive, printer-ink type of

  a decent razor if it was sold by itself without the cleaning junk

  expect to use a lot of cooling lotion with this razor. The design
  of the shaver mechanically is fine and appears to be fairly
  reliable - although its a touch hard to clean because the blades
  are super sharp underneath the foils. I have owned Norelco and
  Braun for more than 15 years and on the whole found them to be a
  more agreeable shave</Text>

  <Text category="health">After hearing about this product and reading

  thing covers only a sixth of the air in our room (12 x 12). I put
  my hand in front of the sanitizer and could barely feel any
  airflow and this was on the high setting. I've only had this
  product for a month so I will have to follow-up on durability.
  First month impression is this thing is too weak to adequately

  <Text category="music">I bought this based on reviews of "Bass Queen

  very funky at all. I listened to "Eargasm" by Plump DJ's and
  Icey's "Funky Breaks" after this and it's definitely missing
  variety, skill in mixing and that "neck snapping" funky quality
  that make the Plumps and Icey so indispensible. Not too bad but
  not that interesting either. I prefer her "Mixtress" and still
  have not heard "Bass Queen..." BTW, my speakers are flat down to
  below 30 hz and I didn't find the recording quality or the bass
  that impressive. Listen to Crystal Method's "PHD" or "Block
  Rockin' Beats" by Chemical Brothers after this to see what I

  <Text category="dvd">I wish I could give this movie zero stars.
  It's really amazing how someone can inject raw gore, violence,
  and sick humour into a movie, and try to pass it off as slick
  comedy, drama, and deep philosophy. This movie is a great example
  of how a director can actually make a deliberate and hard working
  effort to produce a despicable movie. The sheer perversity in
  this movie that is dressed up as comedy and paraded as some kind
  of dark humour is beyond criticism. Do yourself a favour and
  please don't ever watch this movie if it comes on air. It's not
  even worth watching for morbid fascination. I terribly resent the
  fact that I gave up an hour and a half of my life watching it out
  of sheer curiosity. But then, I may actually be glad that I did.

  <Text category="music">I heard stories about Michelle Branch before
  trying out her music. And i was electrified to find out that
  there is still a young, honest and rock-ish female artist out
  there working her way up. First off all, i'd like to say i wish
  to remain objective to all other listeners' opinion, so
  yup...criticism is welcomed. I'd like to let people know what
  kind of a viewer is writing this particular review too.
  Basically, my main influences are Bon Jovi, the Goo Goo Dolls and
  ELO. I'm a 17-year-old male. Hotel Paper is one big step for
  michelle. She evidentally matured her music between "Spirit Room"
  and this. Michelle is pretty much at the state where she can't
  really make big steps on her own. And that's why i think her
  authorities are limiting her potentials by pushing her to
  mainstream. Like the fact that she wrote so many catchy, boring
  and good-to-sell singles that won't last and are only appealing
  to listerners on the shallow side. Although some of her songs
  made me perfectly convinced that she CAN write decent
  music.(Tuesday Morning, Drop in the Ocean, Hotel Paper) Some
  peeps are saying how Michelle isn't quite a super songwriter nor
  a guitarist. I agree. IMO, many of her riffs are boring and
  unoriginal. Even a noob guitarist like me could tell. But
  afterall, it's pop, so that's inevitable. But she could do MUCH
  MUCH better than that. Her lyrics are ok since she doesn't write
  no emo nor punk junk, but a lot of complaining and childish
  relationships. Most are ok though. What i'm saying is, she most
  definetly has her own style...but sadly, it's surpressed at an
  extent where it's irritating and makes me feel like killing those
  studio dudes that are spending way too much time laying their
  hands on Michelle's music. Nevertheless, just because Michelle is
  young and writes her own songs and plays the "guitar", doesn't
  mean you gotta try her music out. But sadly, that's exactly how a
  lot of people out there got attracted. I believe it's more about
  how you like the music. I can't stress the fact that michelle is
  a musician with great potential and future. But to me, it seems
  like she's throwing those away for popularity. One good example
  is, as prolly you've already heard...the posing for a men's
  magazine named M----. Whatever she was thinking, it really
  crushed my impressions on michelle...the cute musical lady she
  used to be....And the terrible decision of forming a
  pseudo-country rock band with her friend. Michelle IS talented
  and hella good compared to the other you-know-who female artists,
  but let's get real here...she has a long way to go. She most
  certainly is capable of going far and i really do hope one day
  i'll be listening to her matured and true music. Afterall, IMO,
  it's only the matter of time before she surpasses Amanda Marshall
  on my list. I really hope michelle could get out of this
  situation and unchain from this game the studio peeps are playing
  on her and make every song and every note the way she always
  wants to. "Tuesday Morning" 3.5/5 "Hotel Paper" 4/5 The rest are
  just mediocre</Text>

  series, but from the sound of it, its all bad interpretations of
  popular music. I just want to say that if you want your kids to
  listen to music and you want to steer clear of the bad stuff...
  play classical music. Play stuff without lyrics. Play a show on
  tv where the characters sing. Do anything but, buy a cd where
  people that aren't the original artists sing songs that were
  never intended to be for kids in the first place. Censoring a
  song or cutting lyrics tends to ruin that song. There are just
  some songs that aren't good for kids even if you cut out all the
  bad words. Think about this... do you really want your kids
  coming up to you later in their life after hearing the real
  version of a song and asking you why the song they heard as a kid
  is so different from the one they just heard on the radio and
  then having to explain to them that the song they heard as a kid
  was a clean version of the song? Listen... I'm all for trying to
  keep your kids away from inappropriate stuff for as long as
  possible, but cds like this are not the way to go. All they do is
  make kids think that all music is going to sound just like the
  music on the cds and when they finally hear the real stuff,
  they're gonna be asking questions. Do them and yourself a favor
  and don't buy these cds</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">I really wish Amazon would let you chose from
  negative numbers when it comes to rating stars. This movie is
  nothing but anti-gun propaganda. I have gotten up and walked out
  of better movies than this, but it was like watching a train
  wreck...I just had to stay for the end. You know, for those of
  you who don't know...firearms SAVE far more innocent lives than
  they take every year, and mine was one of them. This movie CD
  might make a good coaster, but beyond that it is trash. Some less
  than truthful "NRA member" (yeah right) wrote..."I really liked
  and enjoyed this movie. The acting was excellent and the plot
  twists and action kept my attention. It will keep yours too, just
  give it a chance. Sure, it was a little bit slanted against the
  gun industry, but they deserve it and need to be more
  responsible. I may buy the DVD to watch it again, but am
  overwhelmed with the movies I have bought from amazon.com and not
  gotten around to watching. However, I may add this to my
  collection!" HORSE HOCKEY. Member of the NRA? More like member of
  the Micheal Moore fan club. This was the WORST movie I have ever
  seen. They even had to LIE to get you in the theater, as nothing
  was mentioned about it being anti-gun in the trailers! And saying
  that it was "a little bit slanted" is like saying Micheal Moore
  is skinny and has never ate a cheeseburger or told a lie!!</Text>
  <Text category="book">While this book is a good reminder to high
  school students and their parents of the kinds of illiberal
  attitudes extant on many college campuses, I cannot recommend it
  to other readers. The author unfortunately perpetuates the
  right-wing-Republican-only stereotype believed by many outside
  evangelical Christianity. She battles as much for her political
  leanings away from gun control and in favor of all Bush
  administration policies as she does for the truth claims of the
  gospel. Indeed, in reading some of the chapters, it is difficult
  to see that she has any concept of a Christian worldview that
  might veer in any part from Republican platform positions. This
  is really too bad, because she makes many good points and appears
  to be courageous in her positions. I would not have begrudged her
  political point of view at all, had she made a clearer
  distinction between that and her theological position</Text>

  <Text category="book">This book is terribly organized. I'm not sure
  what happened in writing this book, but it seems clear that
  Professor Jones did not compile this in the chronological order
  that it is printed in. My main complaint is that rather obscure
  concepts/people/events are repeatedly referred to, and then only
  later does Jones bother to define them. (I would almost prefer
  that he not define something at all, rather than offering a
  definition 100 pages after his first reference to it!) The fact
  that the book has an index only further infuriated me - clearly
  the author/publisher knew where all these terms were located
  throughout the book, yet did not bother to offer a definition in
  the appropriate/first reference to the concept. Examples are
  numerous, but here are a few: **robe nobility: referenced on
  pages 139, 152, 183. Defined? (pg. 183) **sans culottes: first
  referenced on page 189, defined on page 231. **Louis-Sebastien
  Mercier: referenced on pages 11, 138, 178, 189, 200, 204, 212,
  213. When did Jones provide information (that he was a
  "journalist, dramatist and observer of Parisian mores") on just
  WHO Mercier is? Page 215. Aside from that, there are some plain
  old errors. One such is in the text box on Saint Genevieve. Jones
  mentions that she negotiated with Frankish military chieftains in
  the 570s and 580s. She died in 512AD, so the negotiations seem
  improbable. (470s &amp;amp; 480s would be correct, but I should
  not have to figure that out.) The redeeming quality of the book
  is that if DOES offer information on Paris if you are willing to
  sift through the above mentioned annoyances. And Paris is not
  such a bad subject</Text>

  in a matter of a few weeks one of the plates burned out so only

  <Text category="dvd">That's all I could think of when my family and
  I sat down to watch this movie together. We had told the story to
  our children about the miraculous staircase built without nails
  in a small chapel in Santa Fe. The story itself is so powerful
  and moving. Built in the 1870s, the chapel was nearly complete
  when it became apparent the choir loft stairs would not fit. The
  sisters' prayed a novena to St. Joseph and on the ninth day their
  prayers were answered when a mysterious carpenter arrived, built
  the "miraculous" staircase, and then disappeared without being
  paid. The staircase is a double helix with no visible support.
  It's 23 feet tall and makes two 360 degree spirals, and the wood
  used is not a known wood in any area near Santa Fee! This movie
  however is about a mother superior who has faith but harbors real
  resentment towards Indians and also likes to curse (how this has
  anything to do with the actual story I still have no idea!). At
  one point when a nun is "shocked" to hear mother curse mother
  surperior responds "Oh Margret get off the cross and get down
  here with the rest of us". When the mysterious carpenter shows up
  and starts to build the staircase, the architect and the
  contractor decide that this is a bad thing and threaten to kill
  the carpenter. Meanwhile this carpenter who is sent by "God"
  builds the staircase with wood that doesn't work, is arrested
  after being falsly accused of attempted murder, and leaves
  everyone to believe vandalls destroyed the staircase when in fact
  he originally destroyed it before rebuilding it better. In the
  end the staircase is built and this mother superior (who is on
  death's door) is so moved that she literally crawls up the
  staircase in a very "weird"/"uncomfortable" scene until she
  reaches the choir loft and dies. Wow, inspiring. The best thing I
  could think of is this director and writer took a wonderful and
  moving story and turned it into a Hollywood flop. This was
  obviously written, directed, and produced by people who have no
  idea how the staircase was built but are pretty darn sure it
  wasn't a miracle because hey, miracles just don't happen. The
  acting was pretty good but the story was junk. Unfortunately I
  bought this movie. If you are looking for a true inspirational
  movie that you can watch with your family, rent or buy Mother
  Theresa with Olivia Hussey. Hands down the best Saints movie
  every filmed. Half way through the movie my 5 year old says out
  loud "Wow, she REALLY cares about everybody!" Inspirational
  movie, compared to this disappointment</Text>

  indicate that it was a solitary animal, occasionally hunting in

  <Text category="music">This CD and the one entitled" Night Ranger's
  Greatest Hits are almost identical, but are different in this
  way: "Best" contains "I Did It For Love". "Greatest" contains,
  instead, "Rumours In The Air" and "Restless Kind". The other 10
  tracks on each CD are the same. So, which one to buy? My choice
  is the one with the extra track. Also, in my opinion, both tracks
  on "Greatest" are better than the one on "Best". In addition,
  here's hoping that the band or record label decides to release a
  true "Greatest Hits" or "Best Of" album that will contain about
  15 or 16 songs. Or maybe a multi-disc compilation that will
  include some rare tracks. Night Ranger fans would surely delight

  <Text category="book">This novel about a community in some desert
  village is written with the simplicity of language that one
  associates with old myths, and underlying the story are indeed
  echoes, sometimes close and sometimes rather distorted, of
  ancient myths. God is allegorized as Gabalawi, the remote and
  mostly unseen owner of the estate of which the Children of the
  Alley are supposed to be his heirs. The central character in each
  of the five stories is up against the selfish and oppressive
  overseers who dominate the estate and its inhabitants with the
  help of their retinue of gangsters. The first of the stories
  evokes that of the expulsion from the Garden of Eden and the
  story of Cain and Abel; the second that of Moses and Pharaoh; the
  third that of Jesus; the fourth that of Muhammad. Then there is a
  fifth story, in which the central figure, a `magician', is
  presumably a scientist. He tries to discover the secret of
  Gabalawi He fails to find it, but in the process he is
  instrumental in the death of Gabalawi `who had been easier to
  kill than to see'. It makes no difference: the scientist, who has
  invented a weapon of great destructive power, is forced to put it
  at the service of the new overseer, and the Children of the Alley
  remain as oppressed as ever, though they remain hopeful that one
  day `magic' will put an end to their suffering. Subtle the book
  is not, either in content or in style; and in my view is far too
  long and far too repetitive. The overseers and the gangsters in
  each generation have different names, but as individuals they are
  indistinguishable one from another. A large number of the
  characters are perpetually angry or violent. They mostly `shout',
  `scream', `shriek', `yell', `cry' or `sneer', which becomes
  rather tiresome. The literary quality of this novel is, I think,
  greatly inferior to Mahfouz's rightly famous Cairo Trilogy which
  has contributed to his having become the only Arab to have been
  awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. But it is a courageous
  book for an Egyptian to have written: it has been banned in
  Egypt; its allegories enraged the Islamicists and led to an
  attempt on the author's life.</Text>
  <Text category="book">This is a pep rally on CD; an unsingable,
  emotionally charged pep rally. It really upsets me that this is
  the face of today's Christian music. The melodies are not easily
  singable at all, and the songs use all the same musical cliches.
  This is worship manipulation at it's best. If you read the words
  to learn something concrete about God, you will find nothing of
  substance. They talk about actions to give God and our response
  to God, but no meat-and-potatoes of WHY we should be doing this.
  God IS great, but WHY? This is VERY disturbing, and completely
  unacceptable for congregational worship.</Text>

  Otherwise, I'm sad to say that the average Foo Fighters album cut
  just doesn't cut it for me. All of the songs on THERE IS NOTHING
  LEFT TO LOSE are mediocre, run-of-the mill "alternative" rock.
  Only "Stacked Actors" has some real songwriting substance and it
  does have some swagger and bite, but to be perfectly honest, it
  still isn't a huge turn-on in my book. "Learn to Fly," the other
  track that got some airplay on alt-rock radio, may as well have
  been written by The Outfield or some other average rock band
  along those lines. I almost gave this album two stars, but
  unfortunately I think that rating would be just too generous. Foo
  Fighters HAVE made some really good songs, like "Everlong." But I
  honestly don't think they'd be nearly as big if Grohl hadn't
  drummed for one of the most highly revered and charismatic bands
  of all time, NIRVANA. Elsewhere, their fantastic cover versions
  such as Gary Numan's "Down in the Park" and Prince's "Darling

  he can barely get in and out safely. The balls are
  inconsistent--one will be thick and hard and the next is so thin
  you can squish the sides in a full inch. We're not trusting it to
  last a long time under everyday wear and tear. Our plan is to
  store it out of the way until the next rainy day, he's sick or
  worse, if Mommy gets sick! No need for an air pump. With two of
  us huffing and puffing we got it inflated in under 10 minutes.

  <Text category="book">You get your money's worth here--there are a
  ton of CDs in this audio book. Unfortunately, I found Bryson's
  prose (which I enjoyed a lot when reading silently, as I have
  done with his other books) to be greatly irritating when spoken
  aloud. To me, he sounds kind of 'affected' in parts, and
  sometimes there is a sort of "moist" sound when he pronounces
  words. Hard to describe until you hear the CD, but trust me on
  this one. I think a lot of the positive reviews on here are for
  the book, and not the CD. I would stick with the written word on
  this one.</Text>
  <Text category="music">Greatest Hits collections of rap artists are
  usually a pretty bad idea. Most good rappers pack a visceral
  punch on first impact, but this wears thin with repeated
  listenings. This is especially true of gangsta rap. With what
  allegedly should represent the best work of B-T-H on one disk,
  this collection falls on its face trying to get around itself.
  Arranged back to back, the rapid-fire syncopated delivery that
  constitutes virtually every track on this collection wears thin.
  The raps blur together, and after two songs, the obscenity-laced
  machine-gun vocal play loses its novelty value, sounding more
  like a stylized novelty than any type of artistic vision. Once
  the raps lose their ability to hold your attention, all that
  remains are the rhythm tracks, which are serviceable at best.
  Their biggest hit, "Tha Crossroads", appears here in a version
  that is completely unrecognizable from its better-known form,
  further reducing the value of this collection. Worse, they
  include a warmed-over version of "F- Tha Police", an exercise in
  futility that only serves to dissipate the power of NWA's
  original. Spending money on this collection is like buying old
  newspaper articles. It might have had some value when it first
  hit the stands, but who wants yesterday's papers? C Tom

  <Text category="dvd">I am leading a Christian study group using
  popular films. I was hoping this book could help me use film to
  illustrate some Scriptural truth. Unfortunately, the author was
  much less interested in a Christian message than to make sure he
  took every opportunity to insult the "church." I know that
  churches have problems and hurt people, but it is not as common
  as this author seems to assert. He seems very angry at the church
  (and for some reason, all of western culture - especially
  America.) Living in N. Ireland could make one suspicious of
  religion I assume, but despite his claims to be a Chrisitan so
  concerned about commmunity, he seems to enjoy tearing down more
  than teaching and building up. It is a good study of film (not
  movies - he definatley comes from a critical point of view and
  not that of an average person) but not very useful in the context
  of the church. That's my take anyway. God bless</Text>

  both Rocka Rolla and Sad Wings of Destiny in their entirety(the
  only thing it does NOT have is the original album artwork). Not
  leaving out important tracks like The Ripper, for pete's sake!!!
  How could you leave out The Ripper? And what about Island of
  Domination? I feel sorry for anyone that bought this that is
  unfamiliar with Priest. They got jipped and didn't even know it.
  These are my favorite albums by Priest and I hate to see them
  butchered like this... And what about the order of the songs? Why

  <Text category="dvd">This movie creeped me out and not in a good
  way. Johnny Depp is an awesome actor and I usually find him sexy
  but in THIS stinker I find him really creepy and gross. Maybe
  it's the Michael Jackson-ish look he has going on with the black
  wig and white face. Could they have picked a more horrible look
  for WW? It looked like they took him to a costume store and put a
  10$ wig and 5$ clown makup on him! I love Tim Burton's other
  movies but this one sucked BIGTIME! It gives a new perspective on
  Willy Wonka but this Willy is someone I would keep kids AWAY
  from. This movie is childish if you're an adult and pales
  compared to the original. If you're a kid it's way too dark and
  scary and has some adult humor which will leave kids asking
  "Auntie Zoe, what does that mean?" When are screenwriters going
  to figure it out? EITHER WRITE A KIDS MOVIE OR WRITE A GROWNUP
  MOVIE!!! It's really hard to do both in the same film. It seems
  like when writers try to make movies that appeal to adults and
  kids, they end up appealing to nobody! Maybe I am biased because
  I loved the original Gene Wilder version. I would have been open
  to seeing a remake if it was GOOD but this movie was
  dissapointing. It's amazing how so much money and effort go into
  special effects and expensive sets and the script itself is
  hollow with lousy characters. The whole thing just had a creepy
  vibe with almost sadistic undertones. The only reason I gave it 2
  stars instead of 1 is because I love Depp and Burton, if you are
  not a fan of either, don't waste your time with this steaming
  pile of poo!</Text>
  <Text category="book">I wonder how long it will be before Frost's
  literary stock is devalued as much as it deserves to be. These
  are trite and banal poems that do not ring true or sincere. Frost
  seems distant from both his poems and the reader. What he has to
  say is obvious and unoriginal. How he says it is on the level of
  a hallmark greeting card at its best; at its worst, it is no
  better than a limerick. Posthumous revelations about his horrific
  cruelty to others and his shrewd creation/manipulation of his
  celebrity image as the New England farmer-poet only confirm that
  there was something seriously wrong with this man and his poems
  that an earlier generation missed. How earlier generations could
  find genius in such obvious observations is astounding. Bad

  <Text category="music">With the exception of "My heart will go on" by
  Celine Dion, Horner's soundtrack is not a masterpiece but a bunch
  of stinking skunks who are masked by a field of sweet smelling
  flowers. For a soundtrack score it is not riveting and really
  lacks any emotional connection to the film. Overall it is just
  really overrated and the hit single got played so much that the
  masses just fell into a typical zombie trance and went marching
  to the store to buy it. This was after they kept returning to the
  theater to see a fictional tale of love built around a tragic,
  awful event. It didn't stop them though; they could not get
  enough of seeing all those depictions of people freezing to death

  <Text category="book">Unfortunately, for all the name brand that
  this book conveys, I think the cover seems to be the most
  intriguing part. There are much better ways for book peddling and
  the fact that a firm such as McKinsey allowed their name on the
  title of a book for the sake of a few sales, boggles this readers
  mind. The subject matter seems to be along the lines of the bull
  session with all bull and no session. No actual quantitative
  analysis is used throughout the book, and if anything more than
  an encyclopedic definition is learned from this book, I would be
  astounded. Save some money and go search online for some basic

  bookbuying online, I guess. You never know what you are going to
  get. Anyways, most the book comprises photographs that actually
  discourage me from bothering with infrared. The text portion,
  however brief, is nothing more than a bland introduction to
  infrared. The uninitiated might even be led to believe that Kodak
  and Konica are the only game in town in infrared films.
  Throughout the book the author treats these two as the
  &amp;amp;quot;Coke and Pepsi&amp;amp;quot; of infrared films. I'm
  going to look elsewhere for a good source of info on this subject
  and suggest you do the same</Text>

  Apple&amp;amp;quot; are nice enough but beyond that it's weak.
  Mulligan himself didn't speak very highly of the recording
  session, saying that he enjoyed his other dates with Desmond,
  Webster, and Hodges, but mentioning that &amp;amp;quot;Granz
  wanted that session a lot more than I did.&amp;amp;quot; Of
  course, it would be quite out of the ordinary to hear anything

  <Text category="dvd">This DVD was a total disappointment. First of
  all, this video was a rip off of Baby Genius series, but without
  the production value. Second, this video promises to introduce
  your child to fruits and vegetables and healthy eating habits. To
  be fair, there are fruits and vegetables, but not so cleverly
  disguised in this video you will find dead and burned animals
  (grilled turkeys etc.) and rotten milk (in other term cheese),
  chicken period (eggs), ice cream ( I think it's a child abuse to
  feed your 6 month old ice cream!) and other non-fruit and
  non-vegetable foods. This video shows a toddler chewing on a hunk
  of parmasan cheese that's bigger than baby's head! I believe it
  is morally right to properly advertise your product and not
  misrepresent what your product has to offer, especially when it
  comes to offering children first look at health and nutrition. I

  <Text category="dvd">This could have been an excellent documentary,
  but the makers of it decided to distort history rather than
  present it honestly. This is particularly true in the way it
  depicts Sparta as being some kind of Womyn's Power state which is
  absurd. Somewhat comically, the narrator enhances the story of
  Sparta by telling the story of its women which is quite trendy
  and also totally bogus. She tells us of laconic girls and their
  supposeed bi-sexuality. Hughes states that it would be a mistake
  to think of it as a "feminist wonderland," but that's exactly
  what is implied. I don't know how these other reviewers missed
  all the laughable politicizing such as: "Fighting wars is a soft
  option compared to going home to mother." Yeah right! Unless of
  course, husbands who shave their wives heads and leave after
  inseminating them count as amounting to the progressive ideal.
  Pretending people of the past had the sensibilities we do is
  disgraceful. To many counter-culturalists, history has no value
  if it is not used for the purposes of advancing a political
  program. Unfortunately, that is precisely what we have here in
  this spoiled work. As for Bettany Hughes, I agree that she is
  quite attractive, but she is an awful narrator as she at times is
  downright giddy. Hers is not the type of personality that should
  be discussing Sparta--I'll take Victor Davis Hanson any day over
  her. I recommend that you skip this one and look for something
  which quotes actual historians.</Text>

  happened to Jodie Foster with 1979's "Foxes". Directed by Adrian
  Lyne, who would later go on to direct the notorious "Fatal
  Attraction", "Foxes" is a cheap, lame-brained attempt at a gritty
  look into the dark side of teenage life. The movie suffers from a
  painful lack of character development and goes in a seemingly
  incoherent fashion from one scene to another, making it hard to
  stay focused. The movie isn't a TOTAL waste--a few dramatic
  scenes do at least catch your attention; and Jodie Foster, still
  under 18 when this was filmed, has a real charisma about her
  despite the fact that she isn't given much to work with. Plus,
  that piano melody of Donna Summer's "On The Radio" which crops up
  throughout adds a nice melancholy feel. Overall though, "Foxes"
  really is pretty lousy and can't be given much of a

  <Text category="dvd">This is a surprisingly poor movie. Although it
  has some well-known actors, and a notable director, the material
  was just presented badly and predictably - like a lousy late
  night TV-movie with profanity inserted to liven it up. The movie
  makes a simplified joke of the legal system and its sterotypical
  failings (though legitimate in many cases). It also glosses over
  the grieving process of the family, ignores the normal safety
  warnings to the remaining child, overdoes Kiefer Sutherland's
  character flaws (which are considerable nevertheless), and
  generally oversimplifies everything into a neat package to which
  you already know the ending because of the spoiler title. In one
  particularly-bad scene, after taking martial arts classes and
  other measures to prepare herself mentally and physically,
  Sally's character simply stares open-mouthed and dumbfounded at
  Keifer's character when they meet on the street and he talks to
  her. I don't know what I missed that the 4- and 5-star reviewers

  impossible to even figure out where to start in reviewing
  Sideline Secrets; for even untrained actors this is bad, it
  seemed that the voices were completely dubbed like in an old
  japanese movie, and i think i even saw someone moving in the
  background in the supposedly tense office scene when there wasn't
  supposed to be someone in the backgroung. i will give whomever a
  tiny bit of credit though for turning a livingroom &amp;amp; a
  garage into what was supposed to be a club - and at the end of
  the home movie, i was pleasantly surprised to see the gogo dancer
  was actually attractive (quite so too!) as opposed to the rest of
  the young cast in this trying ever-so-hard to be a soft-core

  <Text category="toys_games">I do not usually take the time to write
  reviews on products. If I am not satisfied with something I would
  return it and write a reason for the return. The kids used this
  product up in about an hour so there wasn't much to send back.
  When I was a kid we had spirograph and it was a great thing. The
  reviews for the current model said that spirograph was just a
  memory and the new one was a cheap copy that didn't work. I am
  glad that the reviews were there for that product. To save money
  I ordered this low cost Spin Doodles toy. Five year old kids are
  always excited to open a toy to check it out. I played with them
  for a little while to get them started and realized that we had a
  box of junk. Why would someone go through the trouble to develope
  and manufacture a toy and then sell it on the internet when it is
  not really usable ? The gears and holder for the paper were a
  mess of poorly designed and warped plastic. At least the cost was
  low. This one was a waste of shipping cost even if the toy was
  free. I hope this helps someone who remembers spirograph and what
  a great creative toy it was 35 to 40 years ago. I guess the
  technology has been lost for toys with plastic gears.</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">"The Last American Virgin" was literally one
  of the worst movies I've ever seen, and that's saying a lot. It's
  not a surprise no one from this film went on to any sort of
  stardom. The writing was terrible, the acting was terrible, the
  direction was terrible, the pacing was terrible, the jokes were
  god-awful, etc. Even the girls weren't really that attractive
  (with the huge '80s hair and bad fashion)! I mean, what the hell
  was that fat, ugly, dorky girl with the glasses doing in this
  movie, and, even more perplexing, why was our "hero" trying to
  lay her?? And why was our "hero" best friends with that jerk who
  kept screwing him over with the girl he was in love with? They
  would be at each other's throats in one scene and then best
  friends in the next! I would say that the only redeeming quality
  of this movie was the soundtrack, but then they started repeating
  the same songs over and over again. I guess the producers ran out
  of money to fund the rights to extra songs. They played "Whip It"
  twice, "Shake It Up" at least three times, and, at last count,
  "Just Once" like five times, when "Once" was certainly enough.
  Songs that I didn't know at the beginning of the movie I knew by
  heart word for word by the end. To top it all off, this movie had
  one of the worst, most disastrous endings I've ever seen. I can
  maybe understand if this was a heartfelt, coming-of-age drama,
  but when you're doing a mindless, teen-sex comedy, you don't end
  on a downer and depress the audience! After all the hell our
  "hero" goes through, he ends up driving home alone without the
  girl and still a virgin, and then, without any follow-up or
  warning, the credits start rolling! I was like, "What the hell?"
  The only great thing about the movie is that I had a ball paying

  On Arguing with Your "Best Friend" Over the "Love of Your Life":
  "Hey, I stalked her first!" On Sparking Up a Romance with Said
  Girl: "Remember our awkward conversation in my pizza mobile?
  Didn't that mean anything to you??" On Declaring Your Love for
  Said Girl: "I've loved you ever since I destroyed your bike just
  so you'd talk to me!" On Major Operations, "Not that Big a Deal":
  Real line (referring to the girl's upcoming abortion): "Hey, it
  happens all the time. It's not that big a deal." My line: "Yeah,
  it's a simple coat hanger procedure!" (and later) Real line: "I
  know dozens of girls who've done it!" My line: "I've helped all
  the gals in the neighborhood. They call me Dr. Abortion!" On
  Nerds at Parties: "Man, there's nothing cooler than sucking from
  a juice box with a straw! Aww, yeah!!" On Fat Girls, Inconsistent
  Characterizations of: Real line: "You know I have to be home by a
  quarter to 12!" (a minute later) "You said you had drugs! Where
  are they?" My line: "I have to be home by midnight or my parents
  will kill me! So fu*k me in the a$$ and let's do some blow before
  they come home!" On Choose Your Mate Carefully: (as our "heroes"
  scratch their balls after having sex with a promiscuous, older
  woman) "Nothing's funnier than getting gonorrhea, eh folks?!"

  <Text category="dvd">I had higher expectations when I purchased
  this DVD. I was not disappointed technically but I was EXTREMELY
  disappointed with the acting as a whole and with the uneven
  singing of Rachel York. She couldn't seem to decide whether she
  wanted a pop, jazz, or traditional musical theatre sound. Her
  voice was all over the place. Furthermore, I found her character
  very annoying...she was screechy and not at all vunerable. I
  preferred Kathryn Grayson's performance in the movie as she
  managed to be vunerable, witty, and charming, as well as
  screechy, demanding, and somewhat tyrannical. Truly, I could
  barely watch this entire video and at the end I could have cared
  less if Fred and Lilli got together. I think that was the most
  powerful statement for me. The production was acted (or directed)
  with a lot of mugging and so much of it was over the top. Can
  today's directors PLEASE leave something for the audience to
  think about and figure out themselves? Everything need not be a
  commentary! I wish I had seen Marin Mazzie because I heard she
  was incredible. Rent this before buying it or better yet do what

  <Text category="book">Murky: In his book, 1984, Orwell described a
  contrived language he called "newspeak", designed to render
  politically incorrect ideas inexpressible. But before Orwell
  there were Russell and Whitehead, who contrived a symbolic logic
  that distorts ideas they deemed philosophically incorrect by
  combining logical quantification with expression of existence. As
  Whitehead wrote in his "Foreword" to Quine's Ph.D. dissertation
  titled A System of Logic: logic shapes metaphysical thought. Thus
  in his "On Universals" Quine argued that in the Russellian logic
  realism must be expressed by quantifying over predicates so they
  reference universals as "entities". And he co-authored with
  Goodman "Steps toward a Constructive Nominalism", a nominalist
  manifesto, in which all philosophers are classified as either
  nominalists or "platonists" depending on whether or not
  predicates are quantified so they reference entities. I believe
  that anyone who says that universals are "referenced" or who uses
  the phrase "abstract entities" fully deserves to be labeled a
  Platonist. But Loux uses the rhetoric from the Russellian
  nominalist newspeak. In the "search inside this book" screens at
  this Amazon web site the reader will find him reporting (p. 20)
  that realists say universals are shared "entities" and are
  "referents" of predicates. I ask Loux: What happened to
  signification? The symbolic logician Alonzo Church recognized
  sense (i.e. signification) as well as denotation (i.e. reference)
  in the functional (i.e. predicate) calculus. I ask Loux: What
  happened to supposition, which distinguishes reference from
  signification? In his book titled Meaning and Necessity Rudolf
  Carnap explicitly affirms that intensions (i.e. significations)
  may be said to be objective without invoking any hypostatization
  (i.e. reference), and are indifferent to either concrete or
  abstract objects. I ask Loux: Since the demise of logical
  positivism does the Russellian predicate calculus have any
  applications in philosophy or anywhere else? Is Loux trying to
  appear contemporary with the Russellian rhetoric? I see murky
  writing. Muddled: Loux is sympathetic to Aristotle and
  unsympathetic to Quine, the pragmatic realist, who rejects first
  philosophies with their prejudicial ontological criteria for
  scientific criticism, and who affirms ontological relativity in
  which ontological commitment is subordinated to empirical
  testing. Ontological relativity started as an analogy: Quine
  relativized ontology as Einstein relativized time. Einstein
  posited relativistic time as real time instead of Newton's
  absolute time, and he rejected Lorentz's making relativistic time
  apparent time. Likewise Heisenberg invoked this Einstein
  precedent for his own realistic Copenhagen interpretation of
  quantum theory's positing of duality and indeterminacy. Today
  physicists describe reality in terms of superposition,
  nonlocality and Calabi-Yau spaces in eleven dimensions. Quine
  generalized beyond physics to our global web of beliefs. Realism
  is a natural, primordial, irrepressible prejudice motivated by
  disappointments in our beliefs including falsifications of our
  scientific theories. On the other hand ontology is anything but
  natural or primordial. It is an elaborately complex linguistic
  artifact that evolves and that has a cultural history. It is
  reality as cognitively captured by the artifactual semantics of
  language expressing our accepted general beliefs including our
  tested and currently nonfalsified scientific theories. But in
  Notre Dame Journal of Formal Logic and in this book Loux rejects
  ontological relativity, and he calls philosophies using
  ontological relativity "anti-Realism". In fact ontological
  relativity and relativized semantics do not oppose realism, but
  rather they enable it in this age of scientific change. I do not
  find this book contemporary. Loux's "Realism - anti-Realism"
  locution is a false dichotomy. I see muddled thinking.
  Marginalized: While a student I found Notre Dame's philosophy
  faculty unsympathetic to contemporary pragmatism and its
  scientific realism. When I left their graduate school of
  philosophy I took with me the opinion that their academic culture
  is a marginalized backwater preferring to protect the past rather
  than forge the future with new thinking. I see in this book a
  textbook in Notre Dame metaphysics for Notre Dame philosophy
  students. Readers who are cognizant of the influence of modern
  science on philosophy - notably how quantum theory occasioned the
  emergence and ascendancy of contemporary pragmatism - are likely
  to be more critical of this book than other reviewers at this
  Amazon site. Thomas J. Hicke</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">My impression watching this turkey was that it
  had to be the work of a film student desperately trying to
  impress some artsy instructor. It's all style, no substance. I
  got the vague impression that there was a story somewhere in this
  mess of flashbacks, long slow camara pans across Stephen Dorff's
  very trendy and stylish haircut, and yelling matches with side
  characters whose only function seems to be to have someone to
  yell with. Despite the very art-house feel of it, the story is
  lost, the viewer is never quite sure if the "philosophy" of the
  main character is meant to be taken seriously, and the style is
  nothing we haven't seen done better other places. All in all, I
  found it pretty vapid, painfully slow, and incredibly
  frustrating, because there is a good movie in here SOMEWHERE, if
  only the script had gone to someone else to make. On a side note,
  Toby Maguire shows up for a little while as a stoned out of his

  <Text category="book">First off I'd like to tell you that this is
  only the second Star Wars book I've ever read, 'Jedi Search'
  being the first. I actually liked the first book, it drew upon
  the Star Wars lore well and was a decent read. However, this book
  made me groan in so many places that I felt almost compelled to
  create an account here to have a little rant about it (BE WARNED,
  THIS MAY CONTAIN A FEW SPOILERS). Thusly: How much of the book
  was wasted with overly long descriptions? It reminds me of a
  'Little Britain' sketch where a woman author is dictating her new
  book and starts reading the Bible out to make up the space! I
  don't mind the story being 20-odd pages shorter if it comes to
  the point! For some bizarre reason the author seems to have taken
  every opportunity to 'ground' the story by CONSTANTLY relating to
  the Star Wars films. For example, when Wedge and the scientist go
  to that forest-resort planet and meet the alien ambassador there,
  he says something along the lines of: I was actually in the
  cantina in Mos Eisley when Luke met Han and Chewbacca, little did
  I know the brush I had with history there.... GAHHHHHHH!!! WHY!?
  HOW DID HE KNOW!? it didn't need it!! *bangs head on desk* He
  does this throughout the two books I've read so far!! how about
  the will to stick your own neck out and come up with something
  new without 'proving' that it's true by telling the readers that
  it was from a certain scene in one of the films? Then there's
  Admiral Daala. Made an Admiral because of her brilliant military
  skills and quick thinking.... so what is she doing in this? she's
  reviewing recordings of speeches given by Tarkin over military
  tactics and following them to the letter and losing! It's only
  the end of the second book and she's down to 1 star destroyer!
  She should live up to her reputation and at least have a few
  successful campaigns before the inevitable happens. (i.e. the
  rebellion win) He then goes on to waste an absolutely brilliant
  idea, that of having a Jedi Academy (the point of the trilogy!).
  There's so much that could have been done here - new and original
  training for the Jedi, but no - he has the Jedi go two-by-two
  into the forest (holding hands?) to *sense* things... it's meant
  to be a sci-fi series! something could have been done to make
  this SO much better! I was incensed to find that Luke was
  actually made 'boring' in this book. Part of my motivation for
  starting to read the series in the first place was to see how
  Luke had grown. It all started very promisingly in the first
  book, having learnt that Luke had turned to the dark side and
  come through it all with the love of his friends and was now more
  powerful than ever! (cool! I thought). It got to the stage where
  I'd dread coming back to the Jedi parts of the story because he
  was so dull. The other trainee Jedi needed serious character
  development (they were 1 dimensional!) - entering every scene
  with Luke surveying them noting how well they were progressing
  just wasn't good enough. As other reviewers have said - one of
  his students goes rogue, somehow gains the knowledge of building
  a super-lightsabre (great idea btw!! we need more of that!) then
  is discovered burnt to death in his quarters... and Luke just
  meditates about it!? *grr* Okay all that being said it was 'okay'
  and on the strength of the first book I will be reading the next
  book (it's like a car accident - you've just got to
  look!).</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">All of us have a dark side. Unfortunately AUTO
  FOCUS focuses on this small subset of actor Bob Crane's life and
  expands it out of proportion. In doing so the movie reduces the
  other voluminous and interesting aspects of Crane's life and
  career as window dressing. Even the screenplay is, at best, an
  uneducated guess at the evening escapades of Bob Crane and John
  H. Carpernter -- since both are deceased with the former murdered
  and the latter the twice-accused murder suspect. In viewing this
  film I knew that it would involve some of Crane's extracurricular
  activities. My interest in the film was as a HOGAN'S HEROES fan
  and hopeful that the movie would spend more time on the back
  stage politics and production of the successful six-year series.
  Bob Crane's professional credits alone would make for a good
  film. AUTO FOCUS unfortunately revolves around Crane's so-called
  "secret life" and is little more than a product for the risque
  film crowd. Facts are facts and there are established truths
  about Bob Crane's private life. AUTO FOCUS, however, should be
  approached as a fictionalized story straight out of a grocery
  store scandal magazine. You are better off spending your time and
  money buying the DVD releases of the HOGAN'S HEROES television
  series.</Text>

  <Text category="music">Just listening to the samples of this new
  remix of "GOLD:35th Anniversary Edition ~ The Carpenters" I found
  it to be in my opinion sadly remixed very badly. Certainly not a
  tribute to the excellent talent Of Karen Carpenter and Richard as
  well. I wonder what Richard was thinking when he remixed these
  songs? As another review noticed and I agree with, is the bass on
  some is so loud it almost drowns out the pure excellence of
  Karen's deep resounding truly perfect voice. This is not a CD you
  want to get if you really want to appreciate the true pure sound
  of The Carpenters. The older CDs (if still in production or if
  you can find them used) "Carpenters Classics 25th Anniversary" a
  2 CD disc 98:04 minute Collection remastered digitally, is a much
  better pick. Especially for those who remember The Carpenters
  when Karen was still alive and the original arrangements were
  nothing to mess with. The other CD's worth finding of The
  Carpendters especially if you like the Talent of Karen's deep
  resounding perfect voice, would be The CD "Voice Of The Heart"
  This is a hautingly beautiful collection of Love songs by Karen
  who lets each song touch your Heart and Soul making you feel as
  if you were right there as she sings each song. The other one I
  would highly recommend, if Christmas is your Holiday, would be
  "Carpenters Christmas Portrait"... "Special Edition digital
  version....Celebrating 70 continuious minutes of the Seasons
  best..." with Karen and Richard. There are 34 Carpenters songs as
  timeless as their sound,and 11 performances heard on this Holiday
  CD for the first time. These CDs are all the songs you fell in
  love with the first time you heard Karen sing. These are the
  arrangements so beautifully done with her and Richard. This new
  remix maybe OK if you have not been familiar with how wonderful
  the original songs The Carpenter's recorded and later
  remastered-Not Remixed- sounded. For this reason I give this 35th
  Anniversary remix a 2 star rating. These older CDs are how The
  Carpenders really won over their fans, took the Music Industry by
  storm and gave a generation of Music lovers reason to Love The
  Carpenders music and the sound they gave each song. Talent that
  can still win over anyone who truly appreciates the timeless
  talents only The Carpenters could deliver. As I more or less said
  in my Title for this review and taken from an old saying "if it
  ain't broke don't fix it!" or in this case Don't Remix it!</Text>

  <Text category="book">Many reviewers compared this novel to Jurassic
  Park, saying it was a better book than Crichton's. What
  absurdity. I am not saying that JP is an awesome book, but it was
  far better than Tyrannosaur Canyon. Tyrannosaur Canyon is a
  fairly intriguing story, but poorly executed and VERY poorly
  ended. It's as though Preston suddenly realized that he was going
  to have to get his characters out of the predicament he had put
  them in, and didn't know how to do it. The ending is too fast,
  too unlikely and too unrealistic. The book closes with a theistic
  comment by one of the characters, which I believe is Preston's
  way of attempting to belong to both camps, having his science AND
  being religious. Overall, I had high hopes for this book and I am
  sorry to say that in the last 100 pages, I was greatly let
  down</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">One of those cases where everything goes wrong
  in the making of a movie: low budget, unispired performances

  <Text category="music">The idea behind this toy is great &amp;amp;

  highest volume is way too low. I can't even hear anything until I
  get it to the mid-setting. My 5 yr old son takes his to wrestling

  <Text category="health">Nothing like EON. EON is the one. This was a

  <Text category="health">Unfortunately, my experience was completely
  different. Starting with the unprofessional shipping. Shaver and
  components were shipped in a box stuffed with old newspapers
  instead of professional packing material. Shaver and Trimmer are
  almost exactly lifesize in the screenshot on this page!! I felt
  mislead by the pictures. Another person said how impressive the
  shaver is. I had the exact opposite experience. I picked it up
  and I was more than underwhelmed. The shaver is about the size of
  a saltshaker and the battery accounts for the weight, not the
  motor. Not to be mean, but the shaver reminds me of something I
  might pickup in a 99 cents store. The other day I found a far
  better shaver from Remington for about $8 in my local Raley's
  store. Of course, to find out about this Seiko shaver first hand
  you'll need to open the shrink wrap which then in turns makes it
  almost moot to return the item, because Donner charges a 35%
  sanitary disposal fee if you open the item. On top of that the
  shipping charges are also non-refundable. On the other hand, if I
  return the $8 grocery store shaver to the store, I'd get a full
  refund, if I'm not happy with the product. Ok, so how well does
  it shave? Not bad, but also not any better than the $8 shaver
  from my grocery store. The blade component seems extremely flimsy
  (essentially 3 tiny blades stuck to a piece of plastic) and if
  you do decide to use this shaver, you'll be ordering replacement
  blades in no time. All in all, I was not happy with my purchase
  in the least. $60 spent on something that should be around
  $10</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I recently purchased this pad set for my #22
  Radio Flyer Wagon, but had to send them back. If you check the
  Radio Flyer web site, you'll notice that the #22 Wagon sides only
  have two wide slats. When I received this pad set, I noticed the
  picture on the package shows a wagon with three narrow slats. The
  loops to attach this set of pads are intended to be affixed to
  the center slats. Since my wagon only has two slats, and they are
  wider, the loops were in the wrong spot and weren't big enough to
  fit around the slats on my wagon. I'm only guessing, but I think
  these might be for an older model of wagon</Text>
  <Text category="music">This car pictured could be a BASE or First
  Version defintely not worth 299.00 These are going for 100.00 and
  less on the web. If you havent noticed the differences in the
  packaging it wouldnt suprise me. Lots of people dont notice.
  Heres the differences below... On these 5 cars there is TWO
  versions of each driver(5 different drivers) that were made.
  First versions or BASE version and Second versions or "Added
  Features" Version. The FIRST versions have NO "added features"
  stickers and you CANNOT race ANY TWO (or more) cars of the 5
  different drivers' cars at the same time! Dale Sr. and Dale Jr.,
  Jeff Gordon, Jimmie Johnson and Tony Stewart cars of the FIRST
  versions (no added features) CANNOT race together! Transmitter
  frequencys cannot be changed. Speed and steering are straight
  function. (no varilable anything) They either turn right FULL
  turn or left FULL turn or it goes straight. Speed is either it
  goes FULL ON or it doesnt. Same for reverse gear. Again, each of
  the 5 different drivers' cars made are two different versions of
  the same car one has more features than the other. UPDATED or
  "ADDED FEATURES" versions have "ADDED FEATURES" stickers. Those
  "Added Features" are... Digital proportional steering (variable
  steering), which means you can turn the transmitter wheel
  slightly and the car turns a little. Turn the transmitter wheel
  alot and the car turns alot. Variable speed control this means
  you pull back on the trigger a little the car moves a little,
  pull back on the trigger all the way and the car takes off! This
  also works for reverse gears as well Now if this isnt cool
  enough... Each "Added Features" car has DIFFERENT Frequencies for
  different drivers' car. The transmitters for the cars are
  different as well. "ADDED FEATURES" version transmitter has two
  "trim" adjustments on the back of the remote as well as the
  Frequency Chip on the side of the remote than can be changed, and
  can also be changed on the chassis of the car. So if you own 2 of
  the Tony Stewart cars, you would have to have a Frequency pack to
  race them at the same time. Now, two or more different drivers'
  cars can race together (or Five people can race 5 different
  cars). NO TWO ALIKE CARS can race together UNLESS you have the
  "frequency of another car and transmitter" to change it, or a
  "Frequency Pack" from Team Up Inc. ALL 5 Frequency Chips DO NOT
  come with the car in the box, off the shelf. This "Frequency
  pack" is sold seperately! You can also purchase tires, suspension
  parts and body hold down clips, fully painted and ready to use
  new spare OR other drivers' teams bodies, extra rechargeable
  battery packs seperately! I have done lots of research on these
  cars and should you have any questions please

  <Text category="dvd">This movie had many of the ingredients to make
  it truly great, including a phenomenal cast, lead by Cate
  Blanchett, and great scenery and cinematography. The actors
  playing Elizabeth, Cecil, and Walsingham spoke and acted
  admirably, each phrase spoken with such honesty and feeling, but
  the words themselves rendered the performances useless. The
  director and the author of the script greatly misunderstood the
  characters and the material. They should have read Elizabeth the
  First's biography by Elizabeth Jenkins. It is useless to say a
  movie does not need to be historically accurate but has only to
  entertain: had the author and director been more historically
  accurate, they would not have created the unbelievable character
  they created in Elizabeth, who is in turn hysterical, defeatist,
  overbearing, childish, tyrannical, who never shows her core
  intelligence, her great love of her people, who had a private
  core described by her motto "Semper Eadem", be always one.
  Elizabeth ruled with her advisors, she was not totally ruled by
  them. She would not have put up with Norfolk screaming at her
  across the council table, nor would Burleigh have allowed it.
  Cate Blanchett's wonderful acting and presence were pearls thrown
  before swine, wasted on a character portrayal that totally lacked
  any integrity, much less truth. How could the director think that
  the woman he was trying to portray was any kind of real woman?
  The ending had me blushing with embarassment for one and all. We
  are laughably given William Cecil as wimpy and ineffective, and
  Walsingham as the mastermind behind the throne. One of the
  reviews said that the director inspired Rush to play Walsingham
  much like the Hindu god Krishna. I suggest that he should have
  first read some English history</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">If there's a worse movie than this I haven't
  seen it! Looks like it was made in a day. The quality is dark and
  muddy with choppy edits. Sort of like it was copied from a VHS
  tape that was recorded in the 6 hour mode after it was played
  6,000 times. The actors and actresses deliver their lines like
  they are playing aliens in a bad Twilight Zone episode. If you
  look hard enough you can see the guy holding the cue cards in the
  scenes. The musical performances are obscure little known Doo Wop
  Flops! (except for Frankie Lymon). Look.....I wasted $14.99 plus
  tax plus gas to "run out" and buy this bomb. The only possible
  way to save it would be to maybe dub it in Swedish, send it to a
  Greenwich Village "art house" and pass it off as a foreign film.
  Come to think of it....don't bother to dub it.....the sound is so
  off it looks dubbed already! IMPORTANT UPDATE.....PLEASE READ

  some significant social redeeming value to this little gem of the

  <Text category="book">This series may be good for a laugh. Some of
  the writing is engaging. But the premise is absurd. WHY, in this
  day and age, should anyone accept the world-view of the Bible? A
  book that tells us to buy and sell slaves, stone our wives to
  death if they accept some other tribe's beliefs, and subordinate
  our minds to an absolute despot up in the clouds of Mt. Sinai? In
  a sense, Bible believers have been "left behind" since the 1700s
  Enlightenment. Tom Paine's "The Age of Reason" showed the God of
  the Bible to be a cruel, vindictive monster. And what did Thomas
  Jefferson call the book of Revelations? "The ravings of a
  madman." Read this series, if you like. Enjoy parts of it. But
  make no mistake: to take any of this seriously, you have to
  regress to a prehistoric world-view, before men learned to think,
  to ask questions; before logic or science -- a time when dazed,
  superstitious primitives believed stars could fall to the earth,
  if they didn't grovel humbly enough to their supposed god. Do the
  absurdities and contradictions bother no one? When the "sheep"
  are raptured up to heaven, their clothes are left behind. So
  heaven is a nudist colony? The basic contradiction, of course,
  lies in using worldly action (some of it exciting) to proselytize
  for the unworldly, the supernatural. But why should we care
  whether any of the "good" guys gets killed? And why should THEY
  mind -- won't they go straight up to heaven? That's what they
  WANT, isn't it? Why even lift a finger against the "bad" guys --
  didn't Christ say, "Resist not evil"? Worried about who will win?
  "God" is infinitely powerful. So Jesus (who is 1/3 of God -- or
  something like that) is sure to win when Armageddon rolls around,
  in book 12 of the series. And the "sheep" -- the believers --
  will happily worship him, looking just like the pictures of
  dim-witted, bovine people you see in the tracts Jehovah's
  Witnesses leave at your door. The going price for a used copy of
  "Tribulation Force" is one cent. Does that tell you something?
  Actually, the story-telling is worth more. The basic premise is
  worth less. Perhaps it averages out</Text>

  <Text category="music">After carefully researching as many rain
  recordings as possible on Amazon and reading all reviews I had
  hoped I had made a good choice with this CD. Unfortunately I
  discovered that not only is the recording looped about every 60
  seconds but there is an unmistakable low frequency rumble that is
  very apparent listening though my 5.1 system and my Bose Tri-Port
  headphones. As a recording engineer I recognize this to most
  likely be a truck or car passing by and passing the sound up
  through the microphone stands that were obviously not de-coupled
  from the ground. The bottom line is I hear this rumble each and
  everytime I start to relax and it renders the CD completely
  useless to me. The recording is otherwise a good one and the
  stereo image presented seems authentic. Since nobody else has
  complained of this rumble, I will assume that it will only bother
  someone with a trained ear</Text>
  <Text category="book">I'm perhaps the only Steinbeck lover not to
  have yet read "Grapes of Wrath" or "East of Eden." Instead I have
  focused on "Of Mice and Men" and his lesser known works, such as
  "To a God Unknown" and, my personal favorite, "Pastures of
  Heaven." I've been enamored with his ability to vividly craft
  characters in particular. When I began reading "In Dubious
  Battle," it appeared the most engaging of all Steinbeck's work.
  Telling the story of American Communist party workers Jim and
  Mac, it begins with the story of hardscrabble Jim initiating
  himself into Mac's radical cell. There is a great (and
  misleading) sense of intrigue - Mac and Jim travel by boxcar,
  work secretly through letters, go from secret contact to contact
  and finally arrive among disgruntled orchard workers. Early on,
  the pace is fast, exciting, and engaging. Suddenly, Steinbeck
  simply fails to deliver, leaving the reader wondering when he's
  going to pick up the pace again. After Jim and Mac slowly
  initiate a worker's strike, I expected the sense of excitement to
  continue. It simply never does. Summary of "In Dubious Battle" -
  Workers get mad. Workers get tired. Workers get mad. Workers get
  tired. Workers get mad. Workers get tired. The rest of the book
  mostly concerns Jim and Mac talking - and talking - and talking -
  and talking. And while their philosophical chats are mildly
  interesting at first, they simply repeat themselves for the rest
  of the book. Most of the action takes place in the dark or far
  away from the narration, and most of the story simply concerns
  the strikers bickering over petty nonsense... ...and eating.
  Steinbeck must have been peckish while writing this story,
  because at least a good 25% of the story concerns finding,
  eating, and (worst of all) TALKING about food. There is plenty of
  action that Steinbeck could have shown during the story, but for
  some reason he prefers to focus on Jim and Mac endlessly walking
  from tent to tent in their encampment, discussing whatever comes
  to mind. Steinbeck's sense of intrigue and social injustice is
  worth reading the first few chapters. But I advise any reader of
  "In Dubious Battle" to take this course - after the strike is
  initiated, simply set the book down. You won't miss anything.
  Nothing of great import happens, and only a very few memorable
  characters ever surface, and they are lost among the sea of
  forgettable faces. I suppose now I'll give "Grapes of Wrath" a
  go. Perhaps if it isn't one of his "greats," it isn't worth
  reading</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">My major gripe about this film comes down to
  the issue of easily exploitable weaknesses on the part of the
  vampires. These extremely frail villains get reduced to ash with
  the flash of a u-v lamp, vaporized with the slightest touch of
  silver on their skin, and melted down in less than a second by
  the light of the sun. Vampires are supposed to be scary, but how
  frightened of them should I be if one can be taken out by
  throwing a clove of garlic at him. Writers for future vampire
  movies should work on making these creatures of the night a bit
  more formidable. The first Underworld movie would be a good
  model.</Text>

  <Text category="book">I don't know what to say about this book. It
  is the single worst book I have ever read in my young life. I
  feel like I've witnessed a horrible tragedy and am at a loss for
  words to describe it. I would say at some point in the book,
  maybe about halfway, every line of dialogue, every
  characterization, every plot point, is absolutely terrible. This
  book is truly an offense to literacy, and I cannot understand how
  a publisher of any merit or author could publish and print this
  trash. I can only imagine that Robin Cook either allowed a child
  to write this book,or was chronically drunk while writing it.
  Either that or he has lost his faculties altogether. I have read
  children's essays that have been better written. While it would
  take a novel to explain all the problems with this book, the
  highlights are: -knowing the mystery 50 pages into the book and
  being forced to painfully watch the dumb characters discover the
  mystery -cliche mania with lines like, "I going to get to the
  bottom of this mystery" and when the character's discover
  something, giving each other high-fives. -racist remarks about
  blacks living in harlem about how they like to steal televisions,
  own guns, and play basketball. -stereotype characters such as
  mafioso that like to eat spaghetti and named dominick and vinny.
  -incredible suspension of disbelief when the heros, nyc coroners,
  fly off to africa on a moments notice because they want to finish
  their case of a dead body. (also paying for their friends to come
  too) -wandering around the main installation easily where the
  evildoers are working, and asking questions, and getting answers
  to them real easy. -incredible annoying characters that make
  inappropriate jokes. (i.e. making sarcastic remarks to a guy
  holding a gun on them) -the book spirals into total madness in
  the last 50 pages to a beyond implausible ending. I got a sense
  whoever wrote the end of book was on sleeping pills when he wrote
  it. If anyone thinks this book is better than two stars, they
  need their head examined.</Text>

  most of her time comparing herself to the fascinating Scarlett,in
  a game of wish-fulfillment one-upmanship. Even though she's
  calling the shots,as it's her book, Scarlett still comes out

  society,but there WAS once a beautiful world of chivalry and
  gallantry and bravery and even some idealism-even if
  misplaced-just as there has been throughout the ages in other

  <Text category="book">AGELESS BODY is Deepak's attempt to neutralize
  the word "old" as in old age. The writer has a knack for making
  common words, like "body, "mind" and "self," into profound
  concepts. His technique is to overlay his abstract ideas with
  suggestive experimental studies. But ambiguity in interpreting
  these studies abound. If you like poetry, Deepak may be your
  read: "The billions of changes occurring in our cells are only
  the passing scenery of life; (P. 36)" Or try to interpret this
  one: "The emptiness at the core of every atom is the womb of the
  universe; in the flicker of thought when two neurons interact
  there is an opportunity for a new world to be born. (P.40)" At
  times he attributes to cells and DNA a creative intelligence to
  direct their own construction and at other times his designer is
  invisible. He would make a great spokesman for the current hocus
  pocus over "intelligent design." He can't accept the growth of
  any cell, even a plant cell, without an intelligence involved. He
  mentions and attacks evolution only one time on P. 115, asserting
  that the growth of a cell could never be a random process. Deepak
  ends up in the very same thought circle as every other writer who
  tries to explain life in scientific terms: Intelligence is a self
  organizing entity and every cell evolved is only intelligence
  having a conversation with itself. Whether your word game tosses
  in the word "quantum" or not doesn't change much. What a
  solipsistic thought; what a solipsistic world. I wonder if his
  readers who actually experienced the oneness Deepak speaks of
  wouldn't, after awhile, go insane</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">Let me start by saying that I may need to quit
  listening to the opinions of some of my co-workers in regards to
  movies to watch, at least when it comes to the horror genre.
  Numerous people where I work told me that this movie, "The
  Descent" was absolutely one of the best horror movies ever to be
  made. In their defense, my co-workers weren't the only people
  with this opinion, many critics and other moviegoers said the
  same thing. Well, apparently the hype that was built up for me
  regarding this movie was more than the film could live up to,
  because I was sorely disappointed, but more on that later, for
  now I will give you my plot summary for last year's supposed
  horror spectacular, "The Descent" "The Descent" begins with a
  young woman on vacation with her family and friends, when her
  husband and her daughter suffer a tragic accident. One year later
  at the prodding of those same friends, she accompanies them on a
  spelunking adventure, the problem is none of her friends have
  ever been to this cave, in fact it's a newly discovered cave that
  no one has explored as yet. So as they attempt to explore the
  unexplored these brave young women become trapped in the cave.
  Making matters worse, this cave is not like any ordinary cave,
  for this one is inhabited by bloodthirsty mutant creatures who
  have just found their next meal. At the beginning of watching
  this movie I was really interested in the developing story, and
  the shocking opener really caught my attention, giving me a sense
  that this movie is going to be different than most horror movies
  by actually giving you the unexpected. However, once the story
  gets to the part where the girls are inside the cave, which is
  actually where the majority of the film takes place, things begin
  to go awry for the picture. At first, the filmmakers were doing a
  good job of using the claustrophobic atmosphere, giving the
  audience a sense of entrapment and anxiety which served to
  heighten the suspense regarding the possibility of impending
  doom. Then the filmmakers introduce a fact that I felt completely
  derailed the movie, this is a cave that no one has been in, and
  these girls are hardly professional. So, who in their right mind
  would put all of their friends lives in possible jeopardy just to
  be the first to explore a newly discovered cave. It's absolutely
  stupid, especially when placed viewed in the context of the
  character's interaction and companionship with each other, none
  of these girls would do this to each other. After this occurs the
  mutants show up, a plot point that I was hoping would help put
  the movie back in the right direction; however, this is where the
  movie begins to unwind even faster, because it's now just one
  gory scene after another, and the movie is nothing more than your
  average monster movie. A decision I somewhat agreed with, yet
  still didn't agree with was the decision to keep the mutants
  origins unknown. On the one hand this served to add to the
  mystery of why they are attacking these girls, you just assume
  they're cannibalistic, but on the other it would have been nice
  to know how they got there. Even though "The Descent" was hyped
  as being one of the best horror movies of recent time, by both my
  friends and many critics and moviegoers, to me it was merely
  another average addition to a genre that is already full of
  mediocrity. "The Descent" is unrated and contains violence and
  language</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Having been a fan of Antonia Fraser for many
  years, I highly anticipated her biography of Queen
  Marie-Antoinette, but have been very disappointed in that she
  often chooses the sensational over the factual. She depicts
  Marie-Antoinette's mother Empress Maria Theresa as heartless and
  calculating for sending her daughter to France at age 14 to get
  married, but arranged marriages were the norm; the empress was
  not doing anything out of the ordinary. What startled me most is
  that Fraser not only insists on Antoinette having an affair with
  Count Axel von Fersen, of which there is little concrete
  evidence, but goes onto maintain that Axel used condoms to keep
  the queen from getting pregnant. It seems to me that
  Marie-Antoinette loved children so much; she came from a family
  of sixteen where children were valued and her more liberal sister
  Caroline went on to have eleven children or more. She was also a
  devout Catholic and using such devices were unthinkable, unless
  one was a prostitute or dealing with prostitutes. In this case
  Fraser is applying the morals of some British aristocratic ladies
  to a queen of France. If Marie-Antoinette had been caught in
  adultery, it would have been considered treason; she would have
  been sent to a convent and had her children taken away from her.
  With all of her enemies at Court, that was not a risk she would
  have taken, if she had been so inclined. On a smaller scale,
  Fraser makes ridiculous assertions about Marie-Antoinette dyeing
  her hair - in all the pictures that I have seen of her, her hair
  looks grey from either powder or premature age; I have never read
  any first hand accounts of her dyeing it. Not that that is a big
  deal; but it makes me wonder where Lady Fraser's life ends and
  where Marie-Antoinette's life begins. I found it offensive that
  at the end Fraser interprets Marie-Antoinette's death as some
  kind of sacrifice for the cause of democracy, when she believed
  in monarchy and wanted her little son to be king. Especially,
  since Marie-Antoinette's murder was followed not by democracy but
  by dictatorships and Napoleon crowning himslf emperor. Sadly,
  there is a lacuna of decent biographies of the queen in the
  English language. One can only hope that the works of Bertieres,
  Chalon, and Delorme will soon be translated and published in
  English. Fraser's book does have some interesting details (aside
  from those which flow from her imagination) and it is much more
  sympathetic to the queen than Lever's travesty</Text>

  <Text category="book">If you liked Whyte's previous sophomoric
  efforts, you'll love this. In addition to being the same dumb,
  hackneyed story lines and stock characters we are used to from
  the previous books, this one has the additional feeling of being
  pure filler: in no real way does the story get advanced. Arthur
  begins as a baby, and ends as a small boy. There are adventures,
  but nothing important happens. As usual, in Whyte's books, the
  bad guys are left alive so they can sneak up and do new evil, and
  as usual the bad guys are pure plot devices and in no way
  characters. With all the (totally ahistorical) democratic
  rhetoric, Merlin's brother shows up out of nowhere and they
  immediately hand him half the power in Camelot. Anyone who would
  read this, I guess, has already read the previous lame offerings
  in this series and doesn't object to laughably boring plots which
  rely heavily on coincidence, caricatures who never grow or
  change, and historical detail that sounds like it comes from a
  museum brochure rather than any real scholarship. So go for it.
  But please, if you want something exciting that will also make
  you think, look at the really good Arthurian efforts out
  there--Gillian Brandshaw, A.A. Attanasio, or Barbara Taylor
  Bradford to name just a very few..</Text>
  <Text category="music">Now on their sixth studio album (and second on
  a major label) Carbon Leaf plays it safe with the inoffensive
  rock/pop of "Love, Loss, Hope, Repeat." Lead vocalist Barry
  Privett has a warm, pleasant way of delivering his lyrics, and
  renowned producer Peter Collins fulfills his duties.
  Nevertheless, the 11-song collection is most notable for its
  power of subtlety. In fact, it is so subtle that not one song is
  memorable. Some lyrics are heartfelt ("The War Was In Color"
  recounts a conversation between a grandfather and grandson, lead
  single "Learn to Fly" regretfully summons up inner strength) but
  with such flat, by-the-numbers melodies these songs have little
  to stand on. Everything sounds just fine, but nothing is
  endearing. Every guitar strum and drum beat can be predicted ten
  seconds prior to its appearance, and Privett, despite his
  appealing voice, could easily be singing one extremely long song.
  This project is obviously well-intentioned, but many other bands
  have done this before and better. These guys without a doubt have
  talent, but this album will soon be forgotten for good reason.
  Next time they will hopefully carve out a more unique sound than
  the one on this record.</Text>

  <Text category="music">Yes yes we all know the mega hit When I See
  You Smile. But it would be unfair to put this album into the one

  gear pretty early with Best of What I Got but after that it's
  pretty bad. How Possession ever became a hit I've not idea. Well,
  where I come from it didn't, but in the US this mob had a string
  of soppy power ballad hits. The production is good but the fire
  goes out for most of the album. Neil Schon is a great guitarist
  but it was the late 80's and the guy obviously knew what he had
  to do for a decent paycheck. Besides, he probably wanted some
  revenge on Steve Perry so he really wanted to make some cash.
  Pity, listen to some of the guitar licks here and there is a
  decent hard rock album in the man. Rockin' Horse for example. An
  interesting additin to the AOR landscape, and some of the music
  is lively. But when the whole thing has as much heft as a lettuce

  love all kinds of orchestrated rock from "the left banke" to
  "beulah." this album is not that good, people. it's not even
  "okay." there are way better takes on the "brian wilson" (read:
  phil spector) sound. whether it's "the ladybug transistor" or
  "the apples in stereo." heck, check out a great vancouver band
  called "ashley park" as well. the production on this is so rooted
  in the eighties/nineties that it's almost unlistenable. they may
  be good road musicians but it doesn't show on this album,
  especially since some of tracks use lamo drum loops "a la stone
  roses." you would be better off going through the elephant 6
  label's recordings or even merge stuff. to be honest, i didn't
  even find the compositions that scintillating, regardless of the
  production. chord and change-wise, they're interesting....but
  that doesn't make the songs good.</Text>

  <Text category="music">I agree with "music fan" about this CD. Eden
  is a good album, and she's a good artist. But either this album
  was poorly produced or something, because this does not show her
  best. I wouldn't classify this as world music at all, because the
  instruments aren't used and it's more classical pop; if that's a
  genre. It seemed rambly to me with many of the songs sounding
  similar and lacking originality. I love her, she's unique in her
  genre. But she really shines as a classicist, with Classics, her
  work by Andrew Lloyd Webber (who she married) and operatic
  albums. This is what she's best at, so her collaborations on Eden
  and La Luna, which are classical in nature but still allowed her
  to branch out musically, turned out good. I have a lot of her
  albums, but I wouldn't buy this one. It's more something to
  listen to once. A few of the songs are good, the album isn't
  terrible, but it's not very good</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">The Next Generation is basically a remake of
  the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre, in fact up to an hour into
  the film the plot is practically identical, though different
  characters and locations are used. The original was a little
  overrated in my opinion and this "remake" is quite frankly
  terrible. Bad acting with the exception of Renee Zellweger and
  Matthew McConaughy who do their best with a terrible script and
  several B movie actors. The only major differences from the
  original are that Leatherface now dresses as a woman, which was
  fairly amusing but hardly essential, and a tacked on conspiracy
  theory. The conspiracy theory of a secret society only surfaces
  in the last half hour and is absolutely ridiculous, I won't
  explain it, theres no point, watch it yourself if you want to
  know how stupidly the film ends. I would sooner suggest avoiding
  this film completely though, even die hards admit its awful, I
  only gave it 2 stars because I reserve 1 star for the very worst
  of the worst (yes even worse than this!)</Text>

  <Text category="music">Out of all of the early '90s, L.A. gangster

  tracks. The movie was laced with them, yet none are on the
  soundtrack. Kind of a waste. Sure, you can get those oldies
  anywhere. But it would be nice to have those songs from this
  movie on one cd. Again, it was a good sequence they used. Aside
  from that; It's okay, I guess, if you're a fan of b-list L.A.
  Chicano rappers. But, even if you are, you can get better music
  from their respective albums. LSOB's first CD from '91 was tight.
  If you have that, then you're really not missing anything by

  <Text category="dvd">Patton Oswalt is funny and my two stars is not
  because of his performance. It's because of Comedy Central
  mangling the DVD version. The show was originally broadcast on
  Comedy Central, and as such it was cut down to about 40 minutes
  so it could fill a one-hour time slot with commercials. The DVD
  has the original show, and then in the bonus section, it has
  "deleted scenes," which are the parts of the full-length concert
  that were cut for time. So, you can watch the time-edited show,
  or you can watch the out-of-context segments that were taken out.
  But what you can't do, and what I have to think any chimpanzee
  able to use sign language would know you would want to do, is see
  the original full-length show in its entirety. So, cheers for
  Patton, boos for CC. I won't be buying the DVD and that's

  <Text category="book">I'm a Wiccan who formally practices within a
  traditional Gardnerian coven, but practices eclectically within
  my private practice. I read this book because I had heard that it
  was recommended to my local library by a Christian; purportedly,
  Wicca's Charm was written by an impartial writer. Immediately,
  you realize that this isn't true. Catherine Sanders has a clearly
  stated agenda: that Wiccans are simply misguided and
  misunderstand that what they long for is offered by Christianity.
  I could write a long review debating the merits of Sanders'
  arguments. Instead, I suggest that you consider this if deciding
  whether to read this book which Sanders claims to have thoroughly
  researched. She relies on the writings of Margot Adler, Carol
  Christ, Starhawk and Phyllis Curott (with barely a nod to Scott
  Cunningham and Ronald Hutton) to draw many of her conclusions.
  Yet, missing from her notes are such writers as the Farrars,
  Merlin Stone, Raymond Buckland, Isaac Bonewits, Patricia Crowley,
  and the Matthews, to name just a few outstanding contributors to
  Neopaganism's base of knowledge. Too often, Sanders relies on the
  statements of young Wiccans she interviewed who come across as
  silly and naive. In another case, she bases her thesis that
  women's spirituality (e.g., Goddess worship)is misguided and that
  Christianity fits the same spiritual needs that women are seeking
  via ONE speech that she heard Margot Adler give shortly after
  9/11. Sanders requests both Christians and Neopagans to read her
  book with an open mind. A fair request. But as you're reading,
  closely check out her endnotes and analyze for yourself if this
  book was truly researched with objectivity in mind, or whether
  Sanders limited herself to sources that would support her belief
  that Christianity has everything that a Wiccan desires. One needs
  to go no further than to consider that as Sanders attempts to
  persuade the reader that Christianity has always embraced the
  value of women that not once does she analyze the epistles of
  Paul.</Text>

  have not read, so I don't know which is more accurate) but the TV
  series is exponentially better than this movie in almost every
  concievable way. There are many things I don't like about this
  movie, the biggest being poor pacing. The plot for the movie is
  actually surprisingly straightforward once you cut away all the
  filler, but that's the biggest problem. There's not really enough
  story to last a full-length feature, because it seems almost like
  it was originally written with the intention of being a 30 minute
  short. And since they didn't have the budget to load the movie up
  with action scenes (there are barely any, and they aren't very
  impressive for the most part) they had to slow the story down
  with drawn out conversations that you won't understand more than
  60% of, and camera shots that last for what feels like minutes
  where we're looking at either nothing, or a woman's nipples.
  That's not cinematic artistry, that's being either lazy or
  perverted. The animation itself isn't even that good, especially
  considering that this is was a theatrical release from only 10
  years ago. It's choppy, and there's not really a whole lot of
  detail (except when it comes to women's nipples). Looking at just
  the animation, if I didn't know better, I'd have thought this
  movie was an OVA from the 1980's. The only thing I can really say
  I liked about this movie was that it was Ghost in the Shell. It's
  probably kind of like how I didn't see the 1989 Batman movie
  until years after I'd been spoiled by Batman the Animated Series,
  and couldn't bring myself to like it for any reason other than
  that it was Batman. Everything about the TV series is superior to
  this movie: the animation, the stories, the character
  developement, the production values... I could go on for an
  entire page about how much better the TV series is. In short, if
  you're you're at all interested in the GITS franchise, do
  yourself a favor and rent the DVDs of the TV show instead. You'll
  find a lot to love, but I can't say the same about the movie. My
  dream is that someday Alex Proyas will give us a GITS movie that
  lives up to what I would hope for after watching Standalone
  Complex</Text>
  <Text category="music">Judas Preist's 1974 debut album. This is
  simpley weird, i could see why the band hates this album so
  much...simpley becuase it is so uneven and utterly sloppy and the
  production sounds like they recorded it in BFI dumpster. When i
  first got this, i was like "What the Hell?", granted, debut
  albums are far from perfect, but this was just downright
  miserable. This sounds like a combination of Pink
  Floyd,Rush,Black Sabbath and Cream on an acid trip. The song
  ROCKA ROLLA was OK and so was ONE FOR THE ROAD, but the rest of
  the material was abismal. SAD WINGS OF DESTINY was such an
  improvment from this mess! The coolest thing about this album is
  the weird scrapping guitar effects Tipton makes on one of the
  songs! I'm surprised that this was even issued on a CD, the band
  doesn't even acknowlege the existance of this album and i can see
  why! Fortuanatly they prooved to be so much more then what this
  platter of stange noises provided us with. I know that there are
  some that like this, but not me! It is very blues based in some
  songs, and the most annoying thing is that some of these numbers
  will put you to sleep. Any one expecting a rocking metal album
  from the Preist will be let down by this</Text>
  <Text category="book">I am sorry to say that I thoroughly disliked
  "Of Human Bondage." I know it is on every must read list for
  fiction (which is why I decided to read it) however, I just
  wonder how such a boring story can continually be relegated to
  such a hallowed position in literature? Not only did I find it
  dull but I was becoming increasingly uncomfortable with the main
  character's perception of women! I'm not a feminist in the least
  but most of the female characters were described in such pathetic
  ways. "Yellow teethed" "Sallow skin" "Dirty Hands" "Tear stained
  over powdered face", it goes on and on. I wondered if the author
  was uncomfortable women? I looked online for some information
  about Maugham. To my surprise I found out that Maugham was
  bisexual. He did marry and have a child but for most of his life
  it sounded like he was involved with men. In no way can I say
  this substantiates or confirms the tone of the book -- but in
  some way it answered my question or concern. Instead of this book
  I'd recommend the following classics: Beautiful and Damned by F.
  Scott Fitzgerald, Madame Bovary by Flaubert. At least in these
  books, maybe the female characters are not the most virtuous but
  the characters are written with such sensuality that even though
  they might not be described as gorgeous they are brought to life
  in the pages by the author with a kaleidoscope of words that
  makes them multidimensional -- good or bad.</Text>

  <Text category="book">I've read and enjoyed all the StarFIST novels.
  This is one of them in name only. It starts like a typical
  Starfist novel and even ties in some references to Charlie Bass
  and high level politicians but there the similarity ends. I never
  did figure out what the author's point was except perhaps to rake
  in some quick cash. The men of the FIST are hard working, hard
  fighting Marines who trace an honorable history back to the US
  Marines of the 19th &amp;amp; 20th century. These "Force Recon"
  marines are a ruthless bunch of screw-ups who could trace their
  ancestry back to the Waffen SS. Rather than root for them I soon
  found myself rooting for the opposition. They invade a fellow
  member of the confederation, screw-up their primary assignment,
  fail to get the info they were sent for, kill allied soldiers and
  airmen, murder helpless civilian prisoners, and assinate the
  leader of a confederation allied state. Someone should remind the
  authors that Recon is about getting accurate, timely,
  information. It's not about blowing things up. I really wasted my
  money on this book, I definitely won't be the first lemming off
  the cliff the next time these authors have something to
  peddle.</Text>

  alot of things in it that are just too far-fetched, and the plot
  itself wasn't a strong one at that. To me it just seemed that it
  was trying to be a slapstick pirate movie, and it just didn't
  work. It tried to be a movie that all the family could watch, and
  it didn't work. It tried to be a disaster movie, and it didn't
  work. It tried to be a drama, and again it didn't work. I got a
  few chuckles out of it, it held my interest for maybe the 45
  minutes to an hour that I watched it, but it was just sloppy, and
  uneven, and the best thing was watching most of the pirates in

  <Text category="music">This will be the third time I have tried to
  post a review of this unacceptably bad album, and I suppose I
  have been too harsh, because neither of my previous efforts have
  been posted. Lets keep this one simple. This is not music, plain
  and simple. I purchased this due to glowing recommendations from
  other reviewers on this site, and was terribly disappointed. It
  basically consists of massively distorted (and detuned) guitar
  and bass monotonously droning on and on for nearly an hour with
  no coherence, structure, or anything approximating the actual
  ability to play an instrument. Call it performance art,
  experimental noise, whatever. It's simply not music.</Text>

  be the musical mystery of all time. For me, Mr. "Clueless" Cresci
  makes it nearly impossible to enjoy the brilliant performances
  going on despite his anti-rhythmic upchucking.....kinda like
  driving an Aston Martin with a flat tire! I have tried to get
  beyond Cresci's chops for over a year of listening now, and I
  simply can't do it. If you're a musician, his playing will make
  you extremely agitated. I'm gonna have to trade this in, and go
  on listening to Live Adventures like I have for the past 37
  years. This would have been much better with the drum tracks
  totally muted on the 6/8 numbers. Granted, this is an
  historically significant release, but I think it should have
  stayed in the vault, or released with Johnny Cresci having been
  digitally removed or replaced</Text>

  believe me they do NOT work unless your room is about 3 feet by 3
  feet by 3 feet. IT RECIRCULATES THE SAME AIR OVER AND OVER IN A

  is simply what the fan can MOVE per hour not what it actually
  will clean in a 10 foot by 10 foot by 7 foot room. The fan is so
  weak at full speed you can barely feel it. Really it is sucking
  in air through the bottom and blowing it out at the top. Both the
  inlet and outlet are facing the same side so you are basically
  recirculating most of the same air over and over again. This
  thing would need to be 7 feet tall to really work well. In a
  hospital they have HUGE systems that MOVE the air past LARGER
  ARRAYS of bulbs. So here you are sitting in a room with your kids
  coughing on one side and this thing recirculating the same air
  over and over again, in a little tiny airspace, what a great
  deal. Just be ready to buy 10 of them per room. Maybe you can try
  hanging 5 on the celiing and putting 5 on the floor of a 4' x5'
  bathroom and it might work in a week. Do yourself a favor, and
  buy a machine that has more UV light bulbs, and has a greater

  I think it's quite nice. (Too bad you can't make up your own

  though--better hide it quick, because... Unfortunately, the book
  reads like a condensed Communist Manifesto for kids (as others
  have noted), or a Socialist agenda primer. I don't know for sure
  that's what Marcus Pfister had as an aim, and I'm not going to
  speculate on his politics. He has three kids and may raise them
  as he likes, and indulge in any such philosophical musings as
  float his boat. Yes, I suppose sharing is nice. Certainly sharing
  one's talents and abilities for the betterment of others is a
  great thing--but in America, we get paid for that (charity is
  voluntary, not coerced). Furthermore, stripping yourself of what
  makes you unique and interesting (not necessarily BETTER, just
  unique and interesting), or giving away all your possessions, is
  a lousy way to make and keep friends, isn't it? Is this book
  implying that somehow friendship can only be obtained by
  placating envy (a negative personal quality that should be dealt
  with by self-examination and intent to change, not pandering)? Is
  it saying that being interesting and having unique qualities is
  bad? Almost seems like it, at least to me. Furthermore, there's
  an overtone of "only by belonging to a group can you have
  self-worth," which is as hoary a case of balderdash as ever I've

  Every song is his snide lyrical diatribing, on and on and on. The

  particular, the drummer also won't shut up and play a straight
  beat for once. It's like three guys in their own worlds, and they
  mash it together and call what they've done songs. EXCEPT for the
  one decent song they did, the only rock song I can think of that
  is hard, psychedelic, passionate, powerful, and set to a waltz
  beat of all things. "LEt me lie to you" is the best song they
  ever made, BECAUSE everyone in the band is given room to breathe
  by the song's framework and tempo. Instead of piling in on top of
  each other till the end of the song like they usually seem to do,
  everyone agrees to hold back until the rushing choruses, and it's
  less muddled and better orchestrated for it. IT's a shame they
  didn't do any other songs like this, at least none that I have
  heard. I tried to like them, I really did. I wanted to find the
  band that made that one song, and discover a whole treasure chest

  <Text category="music">On an episode of Seinfield that is probably
  overexposed enough as it is, the always wily and oh so goofy
  character of Kramer is playing a game of Risk and exclaims that
  the "Ukraine is weeeeak". This causes him to get a thorough
  scolding and a little bit of trouble. I think the same basic
  sentiments work with this New Order release. It probably wasn't
  worth the ungodly long eight year wait although it produced the
  excellent "Rock The Shack" and of course "Crystal", which I'll
  get back to later. Unlike Kramer I feel I can make this statement
  safely as I'm not dealing with a burly, alcohol swigging
  Ukranian, but New Order fans, which aren't the most intimidating
  bunch out there. Keyboardist Gillian Gilbert is not here as she
  felt taking care of her kids is more important, which it is,
  maybe. This album features the guitar of Billy Corgan, the
  frontman of the seminal 90's group Soundgarden. Too bad they
  couldn't get Billy to collaborate five years earlier because at
  this point he was already full blown crazy, and wasn't writing
  very good material or really using his guitar, at all. New Order
  also made the mistake of having Corgan to backing vocals. Now a
  synth is high pitched and shrill enough, but to top that off with
  a Billy Corgan squealing like a pig cherry is probably not the
  best choice. So...Someone Like You is more or less unlistenable.
  It has some pretty terrible lyrics about how Bernard doesn't want
  to wash his car. Now I can relate, I wouldn't want to wash my car
  in Britain since it rains all the time and would probably be an
  altogether futile affair, but this topic doesn't result in the
  most captivating and well-written material. New Order
  occasionnally want to rawk out with guitars on this album,
  something they don't do very often, just like Van Morrison. Now
  I'm not sure if I've heard a Van Morrison song but I've always
  figured it was a give that they rawk out with guitars. Case in
  point of this `not so good of an idea rawking' is Rock The Shack.
  Rock The Shack kind of sounds like New Order's take on someone
  commissioned to write an epic Gilligan's Island rock song, pretty
  amazing huh? '60 Miles an Hour', `Primitive Notion', and `Close
  Range' all suffer from being a little too vanilla and a little
  too bland. New Order have patches here where they sound like they
  might be suffering from the same middle-aged blandness that has
  crippled other 80's artist like Depeche Mode, The Cure, and Tears
  For Fears (who've actually always blown). However, they do
  succeed fully well on two songs here. There is `Crystal', which
  is truly an excellent rock song and show New Order can succeed
  with a harder guitar edge and is probably one of the two or three
  best songs of New Order's career from the 90's and beyond. How
  this didn't get more airplay than it did is a mystery to me,
  because it has the alternative rock of today written all over it.
  The other is Run Wild which is really a great little slow song,
  in the vein of `As It Is When It Was. Probably New Order's only
  full-fledged ballad it serves as a fitting acoustic, moving
  ending to an otherwise disappointing album. Get Ready is good
  beginning and end, just not end between. Kind of like that movie

  <Text category="music">Nelly could make the wort rapper sound like a
  lyricyst, and how dare him to diss KRS-one, he just said the
  truth and he really did not diss him on Number 1, he just added
  to why he sucks. Lets face it, all his songs are basically dumb
  and and really don,t have much texture involved. And how funny is
  it that his friends really have no skill and they are all over
  this album it is just laughable. If you buy this album, you throw
  away good money. Unless you like bubblegum rap. This is more for
  a teen white girl who wants to be cool, but lets face it ,its

  <Text category="book">I bought this book because I was looking for

  <Text category="dvd">Hallmark Entertainment has made many movies
  from children's books, and this probably one of the worst. Based
  on both "Alice in Wonderland" and "Through the Looking Glass"
  this movie stars many of the familiar faces of Hallmark movies
  and children's movies, such as Gene Wilder, Miranda Richardson,
  Martin Short, and Whoopi Goldberg. The lead character of Alice is
  unfortunately played by an actress that is not so good. The movie
  revolves around her, and she seems to move from one scene to the
  next with little emotion or expression. Even the crying scenes
  seemed fake. Where is Dakota Fanning when you need her? The
  cinematography, costume and set design are spot on, as usual for
  Hallmark movies, but the soundtrack was unnoticeable. The only
  bright spot was the engaging song by Gene Wilder's character. All
  in all, quite boring</Text>
  <Text category="health">The concept is cute, although the size makes
  it a bit difficult to store when you are not wearing them, but
  the main problem is that they give you hat hair, compressing your
  hairstyle with the band that surrounds your head. Regular glasses
  go in between the hairs, so everything fluffs out. If you never
  take off your reading glasses, have a buzz cut, are bald or
  otherwise wear your hair flat against your head (but be careful
  of buns), the clic connect reader may be fine for you. Otherwise,
  conventional glasses are a better bet</Text>
  <Text category="health">I bought this for my lower back. I am pregnant
  now and my back keeps getting achy and goes out from time to

  the back of my hips giving my entire lower back the heat without
  having to switch it from one side to the other. However, the
  inner pad bunches up tremendously. I have used it for a few weeks
  now, and have to take the cover off to "open" the pad back up by
  stretching it out again. It hasn't gone back to the original
  shape. If I had known it would do this, I would have never
  purchased it.</Text>
  <Text category="book">This book is very dissapointing. Sure, this

  chapter. DVD comes with this book, but this DVD is not a lesson
  project like Apple Pro Training Series. Not useful. If you are

  <Text category="toys_games">I purchased this toy based on the excellent
  reviews it had here at Amazon, it looked also like a fun toy with
  educational value. I am very disappointed. For starters, my son
  finds it very frustrating that the front pieces for eyes, face
  &amp;amp; hat can only go on in one order. He also has trouble
  pulling the pieces apart once they are together, and he is very
  dextrous for his age. Also disappointing is the lack of container
  to store all the pieces in. Without this, the blocks are loose in
  my son's toybox and we can never find all the pieces. The
  packaging could easily be redesigned to hold the pieces. All in
  all, it is not a toy he can sit and play with without assistance,
  as I had thought it might be. When he does play with it he enjoys
  it for about 15 minutes and moves on to something else. We could
  have done without this toy under our Christmas tree</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Put simply, this toy doesn't work. Or I should

  hoping for. Luckily my little son never saw the toy and therefore
  didn't mind when we took it back</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I used to have respect for Bill Maher. He used
  to actually inspire me when it came to being brave enough to
  argue my own opinions without making apologies; but not anymore.
  My respect dissipated as his fairness was replaced by blinding
  hatred for GWB and religion. I watched "I'm Swiss" once and
  almost couldn't refrain from vomiting. He talks about the usual
  suspects: the president, religion, obesity, same-sex marriage,
  Rap, and few other things that "comedians" are good at joking
  about and liberals are good at preaching about. I know, I know,
  he's not a liberal, he's a libertarian. Well, I have watched and
  listened to Bill Maher and I know which side he's on most of the
  time, and it sure isn't on the right. He hates organized religion
  and traditional morality too much to be on the right much of the
  time. I don't know why his panties are in such a bunch. Being
  organized is better than being disorganized (I can tell jokes
  too). I'm not religious; and I can't help but see much of it as
  hard to swallow, but I'm not arrogant enough to call all of it
  just a bunch of fairytales created and believed by people with
  neurological disorders. I wasn't there when the Bible was written
  or when the events took place. I can't say it's all fairtyales. I
  can only say some of it isn't logical. But, I respect religion
  and its purposes; which is what separates me from him. He has no
  qualms about crushing the hope of people who believe in an
  afterlife or religion, which are both things that make life more
  bearable for them. The purpose of religion is to provide hope and
  solace and relief to people who are living in desperation. The
  same purpose of drugs I might add: something Maher not only
  defends but abuses. Why the double standard? This is no longer
  the eleventh century where Protestants are killing Catholics. The
  only people k/illing in the name of religion are fanatical
  Muslims, but most religious people are good, decent, nonviolent
  individuals. Maher's not an atheist, but he has recently
  expressed a "could be, could be not" attitude toward the
  existence of a G/od, which would make him agnostic. But one thing
  is for sure, atheism has more blood on its hands than religion
  does. Two of our biggest mass murderers--Hitler and Stalin--were
  atheist. It's a shame when non comedians are actually funnier
  than Maher, who wears the comedian label but is too bitter to be
  a good one. Most of the time, he can barely get the joke out
  without laughing at himself. I laughed twice during the entire
  show. No one has ever accused Maher of being modest. He's a smug,
  intellectual elitist. And those are his GOOD qualities. "I'm
  Swiss" displays this all too clearly. In case you didn't know,
  "I'm Swiss" is a running joke of Maher's embarrassment of being
  an American. He'd rather belong to a country where ethics are a
  substitution for, not an extension of, morality; where any
  depraved activity that has no victim is not immoral at all; where
  adultery is seen as cute, not sinful; where there are no fat
  people; where the only women who exist are the pretty ones he can
  sleep with or the ugly ones who agree with his opinions. Thank
  God I live in America and not Switzerland.</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">I was very disappointed with this second

  <Text category="dvd">Bulworth is ostensibly Warren Beatty's brave
  political satire in which a conservative senator suddenly starts
  liberally voicing those opinions that the rest of us are supposed
  to be thinking but are afraid to say. He tells a black church
  congregation to, "Put away the malt liquor and fried chicken and
  stop supporting running backs that stab their wives." If that's
  what you were thinking, you'll love this movie. Otherwise,
  Bulworth is jaw droppingly bad. To take such a hight position as
  to attack Beatty for suggesting that black characters need a
  white powerbroking partriarch to come to his senses before their
  concerns can be publicly considered is to give Bulworth way more
  credit than it deserves. It's distinguished from movies that are
  simply "bad" through its inclusion on the short list of truly
  dangerous ones. Not content to be racism hiding in plain site,
  Bulworth's racism is disguised as its own solution. Drug dealers
  have their transactions justified as the only commercial avenue
  open to otherwise well-intended African-American youths. Nina
  (Halle Berry) articulates an informed point, and it's a joke
  because attractive young black women look funny when they talk
  smart, like high-grammar versions of Zip Coon. In so doing,
  Beatty reminds black Americans that no matter what they
  accomplish, we know who they really are. However limited the
  potential of the opening premise (Bulworth plans his own
  assassination for insurance purposes before inevitably changing
  his mind), the film never approaches the kind of Farley
  Brotheresque world that would have been its natural destination.
  The sincerity of the politician's catharsis is hidden from us,
  both because his new outlook is originally motivated only by the
  insurance scam and because once Beatty starts rapping his lines,
  he NEVER stops, making the actor (as opposed to the character)
  look uncomfortable for the duration. That this movie lured
  audiences and critics into its didactic spell is astonishing. The
  film's ambition to be more than a cute little movie while being
  exactly the opposite reminds this reviewer of Roberto Benigni's
  embarrassing "Life is Beautiful" from the year before. Both have
  to be seen to be believed</Text>

  <Text category="health">I bought this a few months ago, and after
  about three or four shaves it stopped working properly. It yanks
  on the hairs instead of cutting them, which is very painful! It
  doesn't pull them all the way out, which is even worse because it
  means you have to go over and over the same spots if your
  desperate enough to continue. Sometimes it works okay, but what
  good is a razor that only works half the time? Others here have
  noted the short battery life and change in sound when it's losing
  power. Mine does sound "slower" when it's yanking the hair, but
  that doesn't seem to be related to battery charge (e.g. it can
  start the shave in evil hair-pulling mode, and then straighten up
  and shave right five minutes in!) Even when not pulling hair, the
  shave is not close. Definitely find a different razor</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">$23 for the Chinese version and the English

  seen on American cable that you can really see how old the
  teenagers are. It made for a more enjoyable viewing experience
  for ME when I didn't really care for it when it was mistier and
  flawless on cable. So what if there are a lot of matching fat
  scarves and sweaters in this series? I don't get the appeal of
  this show at all. I thought it was really slow. My favorite part
  was a barfing drunk girl in the background of one scene but

  <Text category="dvd">I'm a huge Don Cheadle fan, but this film is
  unworthy of him. [People] who claim that it's a story about
  racism either don't understand the film or don't understand
  racism. Basically, here's the plot: The character played by Mekhi
  Pfeiffer is an unwitting accomplice in a botched armed robbery
  that leaves three people dying on the floor of a grocery store.
  Rather than summon help for the others, all Pfeiffer can think to
  do is help himself to the money in the cash register. He is
  caught, and in the ensuing trial the prosecutor calls him an
  animal because of his depraved indifference to human life. That
  is supposed to be the psychological turning point in the film,
  because Pfeiffer's family insists on proving that he's no animal
  and can take his punishment -- in this case, death -- with his
  head held high. Yeah, right. Guess what? He is an animal, and if
  the story had involved all-black or all-white characters, racism
  wouldn't be an issue. A more compelling question: if Pfeiffer's
  family was so concerned with his "dignity," why didn't they teach
  him moral values in the first place</Text>
  <Text category="health">Don`t waste your time and money on this

  <Text category="book">This book can be very damaging if you approach
  it with the idea that it is absolute truth. As some readers have
  complained, this is not really a "Christian" book because the
  focus isn't on Christ, it's on YOU. A Biblically centered way of
  dating would put the focus on loving other people
  unconditionally, the way Jesus would, and not on trying to "find
  the perfect spouse." The whole premise of the book is rather
  un-Christlike: making yourself enticing enough to the opposite
  gender that someone would want to marry you. It's rather selfish,
  really, when you consider the words of John the Baptist: "Christ
  must become more, I must become less," as well as the warning in
  Song of Solomon "Do not awaken love until it so desires."
  Shouldn't our primary goal be to glorify Christ and not search
  for earthly shortcuts to fulfilling our desires? Finding a spouse
  is not like science nor business which have clear procedures or
  even guidelines. Hearts can be broken, and therefore authentic,
  Christlike love must take precedence. I don't mean to sound
  accusing, but this book borders close to the type of manipulation
  that the world cleverly calls "seduction." My brother humorously
  commented that the book also tries to turn you into a "poser."
  This happens when 'forcing yourself' to be more masculine or
  feminine in order to entice the opposite sex. You have to ask:
  What kind of people are you trying to attract...people who are
  enticed by your masculinity/femininity or people who are excited
  about you for who truly are? I personally would rather a lady be
  attracted to me for my fruits of the spirit than my looks or
  personality. It is a combination of both action and faith that is
  important. Faith to set the situations up. Action to knock em
  down</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">Good lord, but this was awful. Normally
  A&amp;amp;amp;E makes a mean costume drama, but /Benedict Arnold/
  stank like rotting poultry. The dialogue was stilted and
  incredibly unrealistic, the battle scenes were rendered in clunky
  slo-mo to cover up the lack of extras, and the costumes appeared
  to have been rented from a cheap Halloween shop (with the
  exception of the military uniforms, especially the Continentals',
  which were accurate). Aidan Quinn chewed the scenery into pulp
  and used &amp;amp;quot;historical voice&amp;amp;quot; (the lame
  semi-British accent affected by actors in costume drama). Kelsey
  Grammer was pretty darn good as Washington, but his lines were
  horrid, horrid stuff ripped from the pages of a grade-school
  history text. Worst of all were the simpering John Andre and
  Peggy Arnold, whose rose-garden courtship scene was laughably
  bad. In short, don't even bother to rent this. It's an hour and a
  half of your life that would be better spent cleaning the house

  <Text category="dvd">I love the History Channel, have infinite
  respect for the AVG, love John Wayne films, and lived two years

  I might adore this film? I had hoped so, but unfortunately
  Republic pictures made this opus on the cheap. John Wayne plays a
  fictional commander of the American Volunteer Group, somewhere
  between Claire Chennault and Pappy Boygnton. He does his best to
  carry the film, and does OK, but he can't carry it alone. Bad
  effects, cheap stock footage, flimsy sets, and bad script all
  plague TIGERS. Republic made little effort to hide the California
  filming location and even used the WRONG PLANES! There is little
  mention of the OSS-AVG connection, and the film was made too
  early on to be a good history of the AVG, even if it were
  accurate. The heroes of the AVG deserve better than TIGERS; this
  film isn't a tribute to them, it's a sloppy, propaganda film that
  does them little service</Text>

  last much longer than shaving. I purchased it and waited a week
  to receive it. Once I received it, I spent 40 minutes using it.
  In this time, I could have shaved both legs, both underarms, and
  my bikini line twice. Using this product, I was not even done
  with one leg. I went over the leg numerous times over that 40

  sound, which becomes 'stuck' and the mechanism on her back must
  be turned off; she does not kick her legs; she does not close her
  eyes when rocked) I purchased a second doll and this doll was
  less functional than the first one. The second doll cries
  continually. She does close her eyes and that's it! I returned
  the second one and kept the first one because she is more

  Descriptions give you the idea that your feet will endure the

  only vibrate should you wish them too. The "kneading" pressure
  can not be regulated, only the speed. The "kneading" pressure is

  <Text category="music">I can't beleive this guy's arrogance to try
  and re-record songs that are essentially and always will be
  Sinatra's domain. Any idiot will tell you that once Sinatra got
  hold of a song it was and always will be identified with him.
  Fact. Ask Tony Bennett or any other great singers and they will
  tell you. Sinatra IS the voice and then this upstart thinks he
  can do better. Not only does he murder 'a very good year' but
  also attempts (badly) 'mr. bojangles' even attempting to ape
  Sammy Davis's mannerisms. I had the misfortune to hear this once
  and came to the conclusion that is was a)a joke or b) a blantant
  attempt by Williams to crossover to boarder appeal. Now i see it
  actually meant it. Robbie you will never be able to sing
  standards and please don't attempt the Rodgers and Hart songbook

  <Text category="book">I have yet to use an actual phrase from this

  to say what I need to convey. The fact that all the phrases are
  positive, I see as a good thing because I feel it's important to
  have a positive attitude toward the associate you're reviewing.
  If there are challenges in the persons performance, the manager
  should have been working with the associate on that throughout
  the review period. I would recommend this book but only as a way
  to inspire the person writing a review to come up with their own
  way of phrasing... rather than use the phrases in the book. The

  <Text category="music">A lot of people are saying that this album is
  better than their 1st one. That's not saying much because their
  1st album was terrible. There was only one direction they could
  go -- up. It's hard to imagine them doing worse than their first
  LP. I said this about the Young, Fly, &amp;amp; Flashy album, and
  the same applies here, so I'll say it again: When the hottest
  line on your entire album comes from Bow Wow, your album is in
  serious trouble. But let me balance that statement though. This
  isn't exactly one of those album you buy when you want lyrical
  gymnastics. This is simple, bass heavy, crunk music. It's
  effective in it's purpose, but it's totally generic (the recipe
  for most party songs). And some of these songs are just flat out
  horrible. "Stop Callin' Me" isn't only horrible, but it isn't
  about anything if you're paying attention to the wack lyrics DFB
  put on it (and whoever wrote the hook should be slapped). And
  who's idea was it to let Dame Dash (yeah, THAT Dame Dash) scream
  all over a song (Bricks 4 The High)? I want to know who the guy
  was that said "yeah, that's a good idea". Dame is doing what he
  does best, so he's not at fault.....I blame the idiot that put
  him on the song. "Suckas Come And Try Me" is probably the worst
  song to come out of the south since Drama dropped his album. And
  if you ask me, the "White Tee" remix was a step backward from the
  original. It would help if they could talk about something other
  than "haters", postin' up on the block (I swear they say that on
  the album at least 100 times), rims, jewelry, and weed. But
  expecting them to change up their sound would be silly on my part
  I guess. Besides, if people buy this, why should they change?
  That's another story though. In short, the album fails to
  seperate DFB from the pack. The beats are generic and the rhymes
  are terrible ("I'll make you 1 2 step like Ciara"? Come on, I
  could write that in my sleep) And it's hard to tell if there are
  four rappers or just one because they all sound similar. Once you
  understand the purpose of this album though, then you can find a
  few decent tracks, but don't go getting your hopes up just yet.
  There are only 3 or 4 songs worth hearing. "My Music" is
  listenable and DFBs put down some decent lyrics that are helped
  out by Bun B's good appearance. The best beats on the album are
  on "Don't Play With Me" feat. Three Six Mafia and "Freaky As She
  Wanna Be". "Don't Play With Me" features production from DJ Paul
  &amp;amp; Juicy J, so you know it's tight. I love Three Six, so
  that's my favorite song on the album. And "Freaky As She Wanna
  Be" will be the second single off the album if they're smart. On
  Top Of Our Game is good for what it's supposed to be good for
  (partying and....well, that's it), but not much else. Jermaine
  Dupri is trying his best to keep his label relevant, but I don't
  know if this approach is gonna help him any. This album is better
  than their debut, but that's not really saying much. This should
  be pretty obvious, but I'll say it anyway. If you're into lyrics,
  then this isn't for you. If you want crunk beats to bounce to,
  then this is right up your alley. It depends on your preference,
  but this listener has heard better crunk music and recommends
  passing on this one. Standout Tracks: Freaky As She Wanna Be, I
  Think They Like Me (Remix) feat. JD, Da Brat, &amp;amp; Bow Wow,
  Don't Play Wit Me feat. Three Six Mafia (My Favorite), and My
  Music feat. Bun B.</Text>
  <Text category="book">IM not sure where to begin with this review,
  its not that the book was poorly written, quite the opposite it
  was a very good piece but it lacked any sort of luster or appeal.
  It was quite infact extremely boring, by page 300 I could not
  wait for it to be over and this is weird because up to this point
  I have LOVED the gunslinger series, they were all very good from
  front to back. There is way, way, to much about Susanah and the
  whole thing about her having this baby and it dragged and draged,
  maybe this series is showing its age im not sure but one thing is
  for sure it was no Wastelands or Wizzard and Glass. It was a far
  fetch from those titles and it had barely any excitement. It got
  to the point where I had to try very hard to pay attention and
  often I would find I had read a page and not remebered what it
  was about and had to read it again. Im giving this book 2 out of
  5, very poor story line, poor plot however it was written well I
  can only hope that the next book is better, cmon King give me the
  feeling Wastelands did, BLOWN AWAY!! rather than tired and
  exhausted</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">As has been noted, this formula has been
  filmed several times, most recently as "You've Got Mail", with
  Tom Hanks and Meg"Trout Pout" Ryan. Of the several versions, "In
  the Good Old Summertime" is my least favorite. The problem I
  think is that the studio coasted on the Stars charisma, which
  doesn't quite cut it here. The chemistry betwixt the two leads
  never comes to a boil in this movie. There are no real sparks.
  Van Johnson and Judy Garland remind me of day old donuts,
  pleasant but stale. And when the leads are boring the rest of the
  movie can only follow. Judy in particular is disappointing. She
  looks like she has no neck! I don't know if she was having
  trouble with pain or something but she looks like a turtle trying
  to pull it's head into it's shell, all hunched up and everything.
  I couldn't figure out what Van Johnson was getting so hot about.
  I would have made a bee line for that cute violin player. And Van
  wasn't great either. I've always thought of him as a rather
  generic Hollywood leading man and he doesn't do anything to
  dispel that image here. If you're a fan of the stars or the early
  1900's then you might like this movie. But there are a lot more
  entertaining romantic comedies out there, and they offer you much
  more than a mouthful of stale confection</Text>

  <Text category="music">I like Jennifer Lopez, but I am not a fan of
  J.LO...let me explain. Jennifer started her career in the mid
  90s, did some promising work (Selena / Out of Sight / The Cell /
  Blood and Wine / etc.), and a very well done debut album for an
  actor (On the 6). Everything was genuinely promising.
  UNFORTUNATELY, once "J.LO" was born (circa 2001), her endeavours
  got weak, too commercial for the sake of money, too fixed only to
  hype her up, not all that original nor different than anyone
  else, to truly stand out. "Rebirth" is an example of that. When I
  heard Get Right for the first time, I loved it, I thought it was
  catchy. It harkened the days of On the 6..that sassy, groovy,
  R-n-B vibe she had. Then I caught Step into my world, the only
  real R-n-B track on the album and thought, I'm feelin' it,
  definitely a favorite to this day. The the rest came along (3-11)
  and I thought, Sony &amp;amp; J.LO made this for the sake of
  money, due to her films doing poorly, hence she had time off to

  <Text category="music">There are only two artists' music that I will
  purchase not having heard one note of the CD. Those two artists
  are Barbra Streisand and Linda Eder. "Songs of Judy Garland" was
  a HUGE disappointment. I was surprised at the CD cover. I don't
  know what "look" Ms. Eder was shooting for but she missed the
  mark. Instead of coming off as 10 years younger, she has been
  transformed to the point of being unrecognizable. She looks both
  spooky and a little like a petulant child. Ms. Eder has always
  been a very attractive woman and definitely did not need this
  kind of "makeover". And the music...I tried so many times to like
  it. But the more I listended the more I realized I was listening
  to "Liza Minnelli" singing her mother's music. I did not hear
  Linda Eder. I'm begging you Ms. Eder, go back to what works. I'm
  sorry...this doesn't</Text>
  <Text category="music">...when you're gearing up for suicide. This
  whole album sounds like the last thoughts and comments of a
  person who's going to just end it all. I found myself suffering
  nightmares, fatigue, misery and paranoia. My ears unclogged but I
  started getting headaches and a fuzzy feel in my head. This is
  not a good album for the stressed, because it will just make you
  feel worse. I find this album unlikable and mostly unenjoyable.
  When I first listened to it it sounded inaccessable, after
  listening to it more and more I started to get more "into" it,
  but I can't say I found it a good place to be in. It's a somewhat
  interesting album, but it mostly just dragged me down, made me
  nervous, numb and hurt my head. People say this is great music.
  Let them say what they want. Give me some old fashioned enjoyable
  music that doesn't make a pest of itself. Kid A is just ok to me,
  and hasn't been worth all the effort to "get into". This almost
  seems like a sadomasochistic album to spank the listeners. I
  don't know, maybe I'm missing something, but to hear some "weird"
  music like this that has miles more heart and is alot kinder to
  the ears, try "Passengers" by U2. And Thom York sings like a
  Muppet on this album. By the way I've enjoyed Radiohead's first
  three albums quite a bit (including Pablo Honey -- why are people

  <Text category="dvd">This might be the perfect flick for a fourteen
  year-old who aspires to be a mass murderer. There is little to
  recommend it apart from the technical perfection of some of the
  cinematography and the staging of the scenes of mass destruction
  of people and property. Even these scenes have none of the
  balletic grace of Tarantino's "Kill Bill" films, his salute to
  the genre, or "Reservoir Dogs," which has a mystery at its core
  and some fine acting and dialogue that temper the violence.
  "Bullet ..." is little more than two hours of broken glass, fire,
  blood squirts, amputation, beatings and explosions. This makes
  Gladiator look like a Sunday school picnic. The characters are
  totally flat, one-dimensional. There is virtually no plot aside
  from excuses generated to wreak havoc. The acting is weak,
  static, despite the fact that I don't understand a word of
  Cantonese. We are presented with a series of stereotypes (the
  hooker with a heart of gold, the good friend, the crazy friend
  and the bad friend). Unfortunately the American stereotype of the
  Viet Cong as madmen -- and Saigon as hopelessly corrupt -- is
  reiterated here to the detriment of any understanding of Viet Nam
  during the American occupation. The worst thing is that --
  because they are so shallow and undeveloped -- you don't care
  what happens to the characters. So I'll tell you and then you
  won't have to finish watching the film: they kill each other. My
  advice-- skip it</Text>

  watching a syndicated Simpsons' episode than watching this bomb.
  At first, I thought that this movie might've had some potential
  because of the suberb stars: Colin Firth and Minnie Driver ( Good
  Will Hunting, Won an Oscar for it) I did not yet know Heather
  Grahm, but after this movie, I hate her NOW! I will admit, she
  was alright up until she got drunk in the car. That. Was. Annying
  beyond reason. Other than that, the film's set up is absolutly
  horrible, starting off with Colin coming to a town just because
  it's called Hope? And falling in love with someone only after a
  couple of days? And there is also the horrible music that doesn't
  fit the mood at all whenever they play at the scene. Pepole, I
  originnaly gave this a 2 star for Colin and Minnie, but Heather

  <Text category="music">Once again, the geniuses at Universal have
  failed to give fans a decent collection! Although the single disc
  Very Best Of released in 2005 provided a fine and simplistic
  overview of Robert Palmer's career, it omitted a few "must have"
  songs in favour of live material (making for a 90% OK
  collection). Earlier anthologies also suffered invariably from
  "redo" syndrome: the artist redoing a vocal track here, a drum
  mix there, re-recording entire songs elsewhere. This collection's
  no different. In fact, there are many "remixed" and "redone" and
  "alternate vocal" mixes present (something the Very Best Of album
  avoided altogether, much to its credit). Here, insult is further
  added to injury with poor song sequencing. Indeed, the classic
  and sequenced "Sailing Shoes/Hey Julia/Sneaking Sally Through The
  Alley" trilogy that marked the beginning of Palmer's breakthrough
  album is present, but the songs have been scattered apart from
  one another. Thereby pondering the question: What were they
  thinking? Why was this done in this manner? What do fans really
  want? A 2 disc set that features the original material
  (remastered, yes, but not remixed in any way, shape or form) and
  a proper chronological sequence. Done in this manner, such a set
  would properly honour one of popdom's most memorable and talented
  individuals. What Gold has done showed that compilers went
  through a rock encyclopedia, took the right batch of songs, but
  mish-mashed them in a half-cobbled manner. This collection does
  no one any favours. Stick to Very Best Of until another bright
  light at Universal tries their hand at compiling a decent
  collection. That said, the way the music biz is these days, don't
  count on it.</Text>

  <Text category="book">I had to take a look at this book just like I
  did Rachel Shteir's previous book "Striptease" to see if the

  this book was full of typo's and appeared poorly organized and
  written. One would think that Ms. Shteir would have learned from
  her previous book--which also had similarly poor reviews. I
  wonder why Gypsy Rose Lee paired up with her. I can only guess at
  Ms. Shteir's fascination with this topic: my guess is that she
  wishes she could be a stripper herself (or maybe she is). I base
  this in part on a meeting with Ms. Shteir a year ago when I
  invited her to write about a professional conference I organized
  and presented at: she wore a very low-cut blouse as she
  interviewed people. I'm no prude but this was highly
  inappropriate and distracting people told me. On top of that, her
  article was chock full of misquotes, errors in fact, and adopted
  a perspective that nobody who attended the conference could
  relate to. Oh well, I can only hope that Ms. Shteir's next
  project will be more accurate and also that she will make clear
  her real interest in her subject matter. Gypsy Rose, I guess we
  both made the same mistake: trusting someone like Ms. Shteit to
  help us tell a story who didn't have the heart or the skills to
  pull it off</Text>

  big problem comes with the quality of the DVD. I don't see the
  excellent picture others are raving about and when it comes to
  the audio options even if the back cover states DD 2.0, DD 5.1
  and DTS, the menus are showing something else (DD2.0, DTS 2.0 and
  DTS 5.1) but neither DTS stream seem to be working. only DD
  stereo works. I own close to 200 DVD's and all work fine, DTS and
  all. Bought it directly from amazon, I had it replaced and the
  new one is the same. This is not part of the great Live at
  Montreux series productions which are all great, no matter how
  old the concert is. So the 2 1/2 stars overall rating comes from
  4 star performance combined with a 1 star DVD quality.</Text>
  <Text category="book">For years, I had heard the Akashic Records
  being touted as the unwritten spiritual book of life, that
  included every event, every living soul who had ever taken a
  breath from the beginning of time through eternity. The subject
  was beyond fascinating, as my limited mortal mind could not grasp
  the enormity of such a body of knowledge "existing". However, I
  took it on absolute faith that this was so and recently
  endeavored to find the quintessential book on the subject.
  Knowing of Mr. Cayce's tremendous psychic following, I assumed
  this book would enlighten me and others. I excitedly bought a new
  copy for myself and sent another to a friend. After trudging
  through the first 68 pages, I felt lost and befuddled. The
  writing and text are difficult to follow and not at all in
  "layperson's" language. Perhaps this book is meant for an
  experienced psychic mind and intellect, one who understands the
  language and is willing to muddle through the long-winded case
  histories to discover meaning and relevance. My friend confessed
  she had read a mere chapter or two, then set it aside. Pie Dumas

  <Text category="health">I purchased this for about $20.00. And I
  followed the directions carefully. Despite that, a coin slipped
  into the mechanism. There was no way to remove it, even though I
  tried that as carefully as possible. I threw the device in the
  trash. I did keep the plastic tubes that the holds the coins, and
  I now separate coins by hand. The advantage of the tubes is that
  they hold exactly the right number of coins, so you avoid
  counting them</Text>
  <Text category="book">Obviously, from all the reviews, this book
  appeals to many people. I am not one of them. Perhaps it's
  because I don't care for science fiction. I found the writing
  stilted, the footnotes distracting to the point I stopped
  bothering with them, the story boring, and the ending (covered in
  the introduction) to be a Twilight Zone cliche. If, like me, you
  want to read the book because it has some connection to bicycles
  and cycling you will be disapppointed.</Text>
  <Text category="music">I forgot how bad this album was until I popped
  it into my CD player the other day. It seems like every song has
  one or two parts that are totally killer, followed by 3-4 minutes
  of boredom. The song "Epic Problem" is good throughout, and Full
  Disclosure is EXCELLENT except for the horrible screamed verses.
  Strangelight is awesome too, and not very typical of Fugazi. The
  Kill is also good in the same way, it's very chilled out. Past
  these few standout tracks(which wouldn't be standouts at all on
  any other album of theirs) there isn't much reason to listen to
  the album. It's incredibly boring. I suggest picking up any other
  fugazi album first, maybe 13 songs, red medicine or in on the

  <Text category="health">I paid $45 for this aesthetically pleasing
  scale. Sure it looks nice, but if it doesn't do its job, it's not
  much of an accessory for the bathroom. It took me a while to
  figure out how the scale works. There are a lot of beeps
  involved. Essentially, to program your info, you start by
  pressing the mode button, adjust your height, press mode, adjust
  your age, press mode, select your gender, press mode, select
  between normal and athlete, press mode and you will hear a beep
  to confirm. Then to store, press either the up button for memory
  #s 1,3 and 5 or the down button for #s 2,4 and 6, press mode and
  there will be another beep to confirm. Still with me? If you just
  want your weight, you just step on the scale, but if you want to
  get your body fat and water %, you must press the up or down
  button to find your memory #, then press mode and wait for the
  beep before you step on the scale. Now I don't know about you,
  but this procedure is a lot more cumbersome than any other scale
  I owned. So fine, I've now figured out how to work the thing.
  Getting even somewhat accurate results are another thing. When I
  stepped on the scale, I would sometimes be surprised by the
  weight. I didn't think I could gain 7 pounds in one day (I eat
  very healthy and my weight range is usually between 3-4 pounds).
  But if you step on the scale again, like some other digital
  scales, it seems to remember your last weight and won't give you
  your real weight. So I have to put some other object on it to get
  a reading and then the scale resets. I step on the scale again
  and my weight is now 6 pounds less than the original reading! The
  body water % didn't fluctuate too much and the body fat % was 3%
  higher than the reading on the last scale I owned (Conair Thinner
  brand). All in all, I am returning this scale and going back to
  the drawing board in finding something that is even the least bit
  accurate.</Text>
  <Text category="book">...if you're in the bathroom with time on your

  the ordeal was over. Puzo (like Leon Uris) definitely lost the
  touch near the end of his career and this book is no exception.
  In just a few hundred pages, President Kennedy II is shown as a
  tyrant, a socialist, a reactionary, a humanitarian, a political
  bumbler, a visionary of USA utopia, a man who would kill a few
  thousand citizens to save himself from impeachment, a liar who
  can beat the ultimate lie detector, a dear and loving
  husband/father, etc....how many characters must one man be? And
  what's this odd sub-plot of a former-Mormon/Hollywood oddball who
  on a whim (in less than 10 seconds of consideration when the
  opportunity presents itself) decides to kill the president of the
  United States. Once again another character with fourteen
  different personalities!. Puzo even got his basic facts wrong
  about the Mormons (he should have stuck with the Catholic

  philosophical babble that I had to re-read to get it. Slightly

  Congratulations! You are either in the aryan nations or the Clan

  could be a nineteenth century English settler in Australia, or a
  Boer in South Africa, or maybe you just like Larry Niven, but
  that's beside the point) I can forgive Auel for the historical
  inaccuracies in the book. In the late 1970's when she did her
  research, we didn't have the genomic tools to reconstruct the
  lives of Neanderthals, and even now enough controversy persists
  to keep the discussion page lively over at Wikipedia. Ultimately
  we'll never know for sure what the paleolithic was like, and
  Auel's is if nothing else a vivacious fictional suggestion.
  Similarly, her bloated, almost puffy writing style is excusable
  in a first-time author, though one wonders what parasite infected
  her editor. I haven't read her more recent works, but I imagine
  she has probably improved. Even with the pendulous sentences Clan
  is not unreadable. What infuriates me is the casually racist
  subtext of the story, nowhere critiqued or even acknowledged. The
  story reads like a near-literal historicization of Helena
  Blavatsky's Secret Doctrine on the fall of the "aryans"- who
  interbred with "subhumans" introducing the world to, oh I dunno,
  domination by the unworthy, blind tradition, suppression of the
  individual, all the hallmarks of the book's neanderthal culture.
  Of course, even in this the blond-haired blue-eyed Ayla is
  innocent, overpowered by a brutish thug. Against this master
  narrative, all the admittedly interesting side notes about
  plant-based medicine and flintknapping make no impression. I
  would recommend anyone interested in paleontology take a trip to
  a museum or cruise the internet, and give Auel's books a wide
  berth. Also? Enough rape scenes already</Text>

  <Text category="book">The author is a journalist, but he seems
  straight out of the Chamber of Commerce or a right-wing think
  tank. Like business elites, the author basically does not
  particularly like democracy. In his view societies should be run
  by elites from several areas - even authoritarians if needed. He
  is a proponent of constitutional liberalism, based on laws,
  rights, especially property rights, separation of powers, with
  much of that power being held in unelected bodies, and most of
  all free-market capitalism. He finds that set of conditions to be
  far more important than the exercise of democracy. His low regard
  for democracy is easily seen in his minimal interest in the
  manner in which a society of laws is created or even its exact
  nature and who benefits. Most in the West do care. Rights and
  legal systems are not neutral: the manner of construction
  determines relative winners and empowerment. Though the author's
  real target is US society, he looks at the results of democracy
  over the world. And of course, he finds plenty of examples where
  democracy doesn't work. A country in the grip of fanatics will
  invariably elect and support leaders who are little concerned
  with rights and legalisms. But it is ridiculous to imply that
  those situations have any bearing on democracy in the US. In the
  US, the author is most concerned with what he calls the
  democratization of society over the last fifty or so years. In
  actuality, he is focusing on mass culture that is spread through
  mass consumption as vigorously promulgated by globalizing
  capitalism. In this era, elites in finance, business, law,
  banking, health care, various media, etc have likewise been swept
  up, in fact are the driving force, in a money-first culture. He
  contends that such elites once had an ethos of service and
  basically kept our democracy on track via subtle pressures on the
  masses. It is simply a cynical misrepresentation to hold that
  massive shopping at Wal-mart and the like represents democratic
  empowerment. The actual test of democracy would be the ability of
  a community to stop the Wal-mart juggernaut. He especially
  decries direct citizen actions. He is correct to observe that
  referenda and initiatives have had unintended consequences, often
  being usurped by special interests with deep pockets. However, he
  little notes that citizens have taken those routes due to the
  unresponsiveness of legislative processes. It's hard to take
  seriously the stance that the robber barons of the late 19th
  century, and their heirs, should be viewed as elites who kept our
  democracy on course, after bribing entire state legislatures as
  well as members of Congress to accumulate vast sums. If citizens
  had actually been democratically empowered, such distortions of
  the political process could have been prevented. The theme that
  cash sanitizes crooks is as American as apple pie. His view that
  such unelected bodies as the Supreme Court and the Federal
  Reserve Board prevent illiberal democracy is also questionable.
  Who could be unaware of the politicization of those bodies: the
  embarrassing handling of the presidential election of 2000 or the
  cheerleading role of the Fed during the stock market bubble of
  the late 1990s benefiting financial elites? No, rule by elites
  has very frequency distorted and usurped democracy, not
  buttressed it. If the author put journalism first, instead of
  being an apologist for 21st century capitalism, he would note the
  death grip that corporations now have over our society and the
  political process, actually foiling democracy. First and foremost
  that control is solidified through the mass media and the
  education system, distorting and muting all challenging ideas. It
  is not surprising that Americans have been unable to mount any
  significant challenge to this latest version of laissez-faire,
  free-market capitalism that is involved in such harmful
  developments as free-trade agreements, worker visa programs,
  massive immigration, out-of-control energy policies, broken
  health care systems, huge cutbacks in various safety net
  programs, massive redistribution of wealth upwards, the gutting
  of our manufacturing base, etc. The list could go on. Informed,
  empowered citizens would not permit this system of corporate rule
  to exist. The US most decidedly is not in a state of too much
  democracy, but is in the throes of democratic failure, which
  election hoopla very conveniently disguises periodically. This is
  the story of democracy that the author chooses to ignore. It is
  surprising to see the fairly high ratings of this book. Americans
  are supposedly fiercely democratic. Yet here is a book that
  clearly advocates elite rule, even anti-democratic generals if
  need be. The book is really worth reading only to see the
  willingness of some to contain citizen empowerment.</Text>

  <Text category="toys_games">First, the Volvo wagon is supposed to be
  scaled for the Midge series of Barbie dolls, slightly smaller
  than regular Barbie. Another annoyance, it comes with a little
  pink roll-on suitcase full of microscopic Fisher-Price replica

  sure enough, they show a suitcase NOT CLOSED. How could they

  I just wanted my granddaughter to be able to play-like with

  <Text category="book">I have progressively become more and more
  disappointed with Rita Mae Brown's books in the past decade. Her
  early books were utterly magnificent; now, she rarely if ever
  deviates from her favorite (and by now, utterly boring) themes --
  Southern manners, horse bloodlines, and foxhunting. Blessedly,
  "Whisker of Evil" was foxhunting-free, but suffered from a
  heavy-handed overload of the previous two. Rita Mae Brown would
  be wise to remember that there is a big world outside of her
  corner of Virginia, and many of us have grace, manners, and
  respect for others -- and we don't take kindly to being told that
  only Virginians understand these things. That's just simply not
  true. That said, there were some delightful aspects of "Whisker
  of Evil" -- the mystery itself was great, the animal characters
  were adorable as ever, and I loved learning more about Harry as a
  person and what makes her tick. Her quitting the post office was
  a great (and very unexpected) twist. I liked reading more about
  her home and her relationships. However, the stultifying minutiae
  of horse bloodlines was beyond me; was this directed at a
  heretofore-unknown segment of Rita Mae Brown's fan base? It was
  so out of context in this book; certain details contributed to
  the horses' relationships to one another, but she took it way too
  far and I found myself skipping pages. As well, I almost threw
  the book across the room when I came across a line that stated in
  so many words that only Virginians have manners. This is a common
  theme of Ms. Brown's and it is quite frankly offensive. There is
  a big, big world outside of Virginia -- Rita Mae Brown should
  know this, she has lived in it -- but her books and characters
  have become so parochial, insular and snobbish that it is an
  insult to those of us who do live elsewhere in that big world. I
  would have thought these kinds of statements were tongue-in-cheek
  if it wasn't such a recurring theme in so many of her books over
  the past decade. Enough already about Southern manners (a biased
  perception at best), ancestor worship, bloodlines (human and
  horse), and foxhunting. Whatever happened to characters like

  <Text category="book">A generation before there was a Left Behind,
  there was The Late Great Planet Earth by Hal Lindsey and C. C.
  Carlson. This is the book that broke the dispensationalist view
  of the end times into the consciousness of America. A phemomenal
  best seller, it was a watershed event in the growing Christian
  publishing industry. For many Christians, their first reading of
  this book was an energizing event that shaped their future. A
  generation later, many of its former supporters now see in its
  pages a complete misreading of Holy Scripture, sensationalistic
  attempts to correspond Biblical prophecies to current events, and
  an unhealthy enthusiasm for seeing the world obliterated. So why
  bother with what can easily be written off as paranoid
  millenarianism? Well, while many have outgrown its simplistic
  approach to world events, it still resounds for much of the
  Church and this is shown in the continued audience for books by
  Lindsey and other "prophecy pundits." While it is certainly true
  that Tim LaHaye has replaced Lindsey as the popular voice of
  dispensationalism, it cannot be denied that Left Behind was made
  possible by this book. Part of the commercial success of both
  authors has to do with their placing the dispensationalist view
  in a popular book form. For LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins, it was
  the pulp novel. Back in 1970, Lindsay and C. C. Carlson did the
  same with a popular genre of their day - the sensationalistic
  expose. Like most books of this type (e.g., The Bermuda Triangle,
  Chariots of the Gods?, The Philadelphia Experiment, The
  Population Bomb), it is written in a breezy soundbite style that
  is long on conjecture and short on facts. Like most of these
  books, it was a peculiar period piece of American life at a time
  when the fabric of the nation seemed to be coming apart at the
  seams. Like most of these books, it is laughable in retrospect.
  If the book were out of circulation and I were reviewing this for
  historical purposes, I would almost be tempted to give it a free
  pass as a kitschy period piece...sort of a fundamentalist lava
  lamp. The original was so over the top and written with such
  enthusiasm one could almost have forgiven the fact that the
  authors got everything wrong. After all, it was the 1970's when
  wild conspiracy theories, distrust of any traditional authority,
  and predictions of impending disaster were all the rage. When
  viewed within a time frame that produced predictions of a soon to
  be ice age, a UFO invasion, a famine around the corner, and
  California falling into the Pacific Ocean, the authors' claims of
  the coming Armageddon look downright trendy. However, in the
  intervening years, the revisions of this book just kept piling
  up. Make a bad prediction? No problem, edit the book with the old
  gaffes removed, add a few trendier predictions, and release it as
  a new book. Lindsey, now well into middle age and hurtling
  towards his golden years, still clings to the long discredited
  dispensationalist hypothesis (Carleton's contribution is more
  stylistic) despite his failed scenarios. Lindsey's original view
  was that the end times events would take place in the 1980s (he
  even wrote a book The 1980's: Countdown to Armageddon trumpeting
  this belief). Well that didn't pan out, so he then jumped on the
  Y2K bandwagon (another of his books was Planet Earth 2000 A.D.:
  Will Mankind Survive?). Oops, wrong again. First communism was
  the main source of evil in the world but more recently it is
  Islam (a more recent book is The Everlasting Hatred: The Roots of
  Jihad). When one bogeyman falls, he is quick to insert a new one
  in its place. Between the failed predictions, the hilarious
  misreadings of the original languages, the bizarre correlations
  between apocalyptic symbolism and modern military technology, and
  the hysterical pleading for contemporary events fulfilling the
  Biblical prophecies "right before our eyes", it is not surprising
  many of those energized by this book became convinced of the
  imminent end of all things. This trend continues to this day for
  the many followers of dispensationalist worldview as they are
  perpetuated in the many novels based on dispensationalist beliefs
  - notably the Left Behind series of novels. If you can find a
  copy of the original version from 1970, it can be interesting in
  much the same way as a Brady Bunch episode - not for its merit
  but as an example of a particular moment in the consciousness of
  the fundamentalist subculture at a particular time. Just as many
  Catholics have vivid memories of nuns and the Baltimore
  Catechism, fundamentalists of that era will never forget this
  book and the movie A Thief in the Night. However, for the
  reedited version here presented as a guide to interpreting
  biblical prophecy, it is best to pass. For all its success as a
  cultural marker, its usefulness in properly understanding
  Biblical prophecy is basically nil. For this, its original
  purpose, The Late Great Planet Earth is completely
  worthless.</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">Ok, check it out, there's two Jack Blacks. One
  is the guy from Tenacious D, you see him all the time. He's funny
  and childish and insane. Then there's the other Jack Black. He's
  the evil creature who pervades films like Shallow Hal and King
  Kong, whose only humorous lines are the ones that are funny by
  accident. Well, as long as you aren't fat and don't feel
  patronized by Gweneth presuming to know what it's like not to be
  desired all her life (ha), then by all means suspend all
  disbelief, logic, and brain power and watch this dumb movie.
  Gweneth's fat suit is actually pretty convincing, although most
  of the movie she's played by an actual fat chick...who by the way
  should have just been left in, without the whole "ha ha the dude
  thinks she's skinny" nonsense. Obviously, a film about a dude
  trying to cope with dating a big girl would have a lot more
  resonance if: a) He weren't brainwashed b) His fat girlfriend
  wasn't replaced by a twiggy blond chick c) The movie didn't throw
  ridiculous concepts your way (like a guy could have sex with a
  300 lb woman without realizing it) d) Tony Robbins was in no way
  involved whatsoever I knew I was slumming it when I saw this
  movie. But I'm not sure what the message of this film is. Jack
  Black's character is decent, considerate, great with kids and
  perfect in every way. Oh, except he's really shallow for no
  dicernable reason, other than his dad's dying words were for him
  to go out and chase tail. The weird part is that Hal's not a bad
  person. The movie beats you over the head showing you he's the
  nicest guy on on the face of the Earth, so you can't really laugh
  at him looking like an idiot. Rosemary is so fat she has
  superpowers. Her butt actually creates typhoons (I wonder if that
  has military applications?). Suddenly, Hal mistakes ugly pimply
  girls for supermodels and evil skanks for old shrews. Tony
  Robbins brainwashed him, the fiend! When Hal finally realizes
  this he decides to (ooh big spoiler) love Rosemary anyway, and
  learns a VALUBLE LESSON. Along the way there are a ton of cliches
  like people thinking he's dating Rosemary just because her dad
  happens to be his boss, and a sexy neighbor in his building who
  starts to get the hots for him when she sees how non-judgemental
  he is dating a fat girl ('cause that would make any woman melt).
  Of course there's requisite best friend, played by Jason
  Alexander, who is repulsed by fat people and plots to get Hal to
  dump her. Then again, the friend is a complete troll, so I don't
  know why Hal would want him around. And to insult us further,
  they force some burned kids on us at the hospital to strike a
  SERIOUS note about how true beauty is on the inside.
  Too...many...public...service...messages! PICK...ONE..!! But
  brain-dead writing aside, Paltrow really sells her performance
  when they actually show her in the fat suit (despite Gweneth's
  postering when this film was first released). Regardless of its
  clumsy benevolence, I have to rate this as a romantic comedy. And
  for that, I give it a rating of totally unremarkable. Nice
  gesture, Farelly brothers. Not to be bothered with</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">To say this film is self-indulgent is a
  masterpiece of understatement. Almost every joke in this movie
  that didn't center around profanity or flatulence was a nod to
  one of Smiths other movies. Maybe if you are a great filmmaker
  you can get away with that, but if you have only made 4 other
  films (very poor ones too by cinematic standards) then that just
  means you have the worlds biggest ego. The film looks as if it
  was written by a highschool kid, although the humor really
  dosen't reach even that level. Here is a recap of the types of
  humor in this film. Making fun of fans, fart jokes, scatological
  jokes, profanity (yes this is actually supposed to be funny in
  and of itself), making fun of miramax, making fun of the viewers
  for actually being stupid enough to pay to see this film (I swear
  I am not making this up), and any number of inside jokes
  involving the cast and crew. This movie comes across as crass,
  tasteless, profane and generally an abject debacle in all
  respects. Thank God I borrowed this movie and didn't pay anything

  deposition against Anna Wintour from everybody who had/has a
  major or minor gripe with her. It's a heavy and boring read.
  Gossip, if one can get over oneself and admit that it is
  entertaining, should remain light and diverting. In this book, it
  is difficult to garner much sympathy for the subject or its
  author, much less derive the slightest enjoyment from it. I was

  <Text category="book">Native Tongue by Carl Hiaasen This book is
  fast paced, has a lot of energy, and a zany weirdness. No doubt,
  it is a page-turner. And it is better than the other book of
  Hiaasen's I have read, Double Whammy. But all that does not a
  good read make... A strength of Hiaasen's books are his
  characters, well defined and numerous. Most are straightforward
  stereotypes, from the out-of-luck journalist-turned-publicist,
  the vapid sex-phone girlfriend, a steroid-doped strongman, the
  crude-and-sleazy millionaire bad-guy, a muscular-but-clear-minded
  black good-guy cop, to the dumb-but-intrinsically good-guy
  burglars, and loads of redneck Florida "crackers". Hiaasen makes
  this cast interesting by having them jump through zany hoops, and
  by casting two characters that are quite original, an
  environmentally-militant 70+ aged woman, and an
  environmentally-crazed former-governor-gone-wildman. And we meet
  psychotic whales and sex-starved dolphins. Etc. etc. So what's
  wrong. Mainly, it's that the book stays at a level of
  TV-sitcom-gone-book. It achieves zero depth in dealing with any
  subject. One might think that the exception is the environment,
  but the story is so inane that it cannot achieve traction even
  here. So perhaps Native Tongue is just pure entertainment? If you
  like brainless action, gratuitous violence, gross humor, and zany
  "fun", Native Tongue might satisfy. I have one additional problem
  with Hiassen, and it's similar to the problem I so often have
  with Michael Crichton. These books stink of hypocrisy. Crichton
  makes a (seriously good) living off nifty science ideas while
  constantly bashing that same science. Hiassen's heroes work hard
  to rise out of the trash heap of modern society, but Hiaasen's
  writing routinely wallows in that same trash heap for supposed
  laughs and zaniness. While I enjoyed a few sections of Native
  Tongue, I had no doubts at the end that I had wasted many hours
  that should have been better spent</Text>
  <Text category="book">I found two paperbacks at work, which were
  both thriller series, both written by women, both having two word

  it easy to get into the book. But I found it too new age for me.
  Between Eve talking to her dead daughter to the creepy Aldo to

  primitive, the jokes are quite boring. Actually what is really
  amazing, that it could've been ok to watch as a family movie, but
  a few really tasteless jokes made it PG13 rated without adding
  any fun, so the movie about family values is not appropriate for
  kids. Too boring for adults, not appropriate for kids, too much
  moral for young crowd - I can't really think who might like

  <Text category="book">After reading the trilogy, I was left
  wondering what the hell happened? I have just read all 3 of the
  His Dark Materials trilogy and what was a strong start in book 1
  and 2 is utterly demolished in this clunker. Pullman allowed his
  eagerness to bash religion to completely destroy an engaging
  story - one of the most creative stories I've come across in 20
  years of reading fantasy. There isn't even a remote chance of a
  sequel to fix up this mess. If you look up `anticlimax' in the
  dictionary, you'll see a picture of this book. From first page to
  last, time is wasted on boring characters, while all the good
  ones are either killed off, or just MIA for the entire book.
  Spoilers ahead. What about Lyra and her parents? Somehow, she
  never knows what happened to them and after all she has been
  through is supposed to be content with going back to school like
  a good little girl? She never even confronts them to try and
  understand their motivations. And Will just goes back with Mary
  Malone to her apartment so they can figure out how to avoid the
  cops. Over a cup of tea, naturally. And that's it for him. In
  addition to all that, this book doesn't even seem to be connected
  to the first two. None of the characters resonate they way they
  used to and instead of being good friends, Will and Lyra fall in
  love and have sex at the tender age of 11 or 12 . . . all in the
  last 30 pages. What happened to the story, for cripes sake?! And
  what happened to the `temptation'? Was choosing not to stay with
  Will her way of not succumbing to it? The whole premise is just
  so lame to start out with. As an earlier reviewer pointed out all
  the windows that were opened for centuries didn't endanger the
  universe, why not leave one open for 60 or 70 years to give Lyra
  and Will a chance to know each other. The flimsy reasoning behind
  this is just as contrived as their sudden and immediate love for
  one another. Supposedly, they had more than gonads going for
  them, they survived death together! Pullman didn't feel like
  thinking it through, he just wanted a gut wrenching ending. In
  addition to that, he wanted to mock the reader by taunting us
  with the `reality' of knowing that nothing they did in the
  trilogy has any hope or meaning. All of Will and Lyra's efforts
  are futile, kind of like - guess what? religion for the rest of
  us morons. After having the reader go through endless pages on
  the mulefa-elephant aliens or whatever, ultimately the characters
  the reader wants to know about disappear with barely a whimper.
  Iorek Byrnison, Lee Scoresby - instead we get page after page
  about Mary Malone the Disaffected former Nun. Pullman all but
  pants in his eagerness to give the finger to anyone of us who
  believes in Him or anything for that matter! This is NOT
  children's literature, it's a hate ridden manifesto that is more
  suitable for adults who at least have some way of maintaining
  some sort of perspective throughout this sloppy mess. It's
  totally dishonest to sell this as a children's book, or even as a
  competent work of fiction. All of the painstaking work of the
  first two books is undone with this one. We never get closure on
  Lyra's parents. We never really understand what Dust is and where
  it comes from. We never see Will reunited with his mother. We get
  a lame battle where `god' dies and no one even knows why or how.
  Lyra and Will fall in love, but have to `sacrifice' it so that
  all the windows to other worlds can be shut forever, with only
  flimsy reasoning behind it. The mulefa and Mary Malone's work
  together amounts to nothing, everyone just goes home. Presumably,
  Will goes home, although we never see it. All that yearning after
  his mother and so forth . . .nothing. The major enemies are
  killed off too easily - and what about Armageddon? What happened
  to the Fortress and all the rebel angels and . . .you get the
  idea. It all just sort of disovles. Mary forgot to be the
  Serpent, or else I missed that in one of the countless pages on
  the mulefa. Another reader pointed out: " Phillip Pullman could
  have written a masterpiece with this series. Instead, the story
  falls flat under the weight of the author's own agendas and
  mockeries. What a waste of time. I can't believe this book
  actually won awards. It stopped being thought-provoking and
  started being inane and silly." It would have been better if Lyra
  had just awakened one morning and it was all a dream. Instead,
  relearning how to read the alethiometer will somehow enable her
  to build the Kingdom of Heaven in the course of her lifetime.
  Absurd. This was one of the most disappointing and infuriating
  reads of my life.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">George Sluizer's original Dutch-French version
  of The Vanishing (aka The Man Who Wanted to Know) offers one of
  European cinema's most quietly disturbingly anonymous and
  everyday sociopaths, feeling his way one step at a time towards
  murder. If you've seen that version, you probably still can't get
  the final revelation out of your head, but the film had plenty
  more to offer than that, playing with chronology, subverting the
  usual cliches of its 'Lady Vanishes' plot (the hero wants to know
  what happened to his missing lover far more than he wants her to
  be alive) and throwing in some excellent characterization. I can
  only assume that for this 1993 US remake Sluizer was so
  determined that no-one else was going to get the chance to ruin
  his film when he was perfectly capable of doing it himself, but
  few people could have anticipated how comprehensively he trashes
  his own work. His career never recovered. Chief culprit is an
  astonishing performance by Jeff Bridges that has been overthought
  through in every detail to a truly disastrous level. A friend who
  produced one of his earliest movies noted that Bridges was a
  great instinctive actor as long as you stopped him thinking about
  what he was doing, and this film is the proof of the pudding.
  Every movement is overly mechanical in its precision, making him
  look like a rusty clockwork toy, while his voice is a bizarre
  mixture of Tootsie, Latka Gravas from Taxi and a Dalek who have
  all been taking elocution lessons from Dok-tah E-ville. No
  banality of evil here, just a looney walking around with an
  invisible sign over his head saying "Please. Let. Me. Kill. You.
  Thank you. For your. Consideration.' But the blame really needs
  to be shared out here. None of the performances are good: often,
  they don't even look good - Keifer Sutherland looks more like a
  baby hamster than a distraught man at his wits end in the hurried
  scenes at the gas station, Nancy Travis flounders badly and
  Sandra Bullock makes no impression at all as the object of his
  obsession. Not that they're given any help by either director or
  writer Todd Graff. The script is particularly weak. The
  chronology has been altered to put the focus firmly on Bridges at
  the expense of the couple at the opening of the film. Worse is
  the rush the film is in, draining the life and character from
  each scene in its race to get to the next. Rather than the
  high/low mood shifts in the couple's relationship or the
  apparently casual but careful establishing of the feel of the
  location, we just get a couple of arguments that give you the
  impression that he's probably better off without her. As for the
  new and improved happy ending - standard woman chased by nutter
  in the woods jeopardy stuff complete with lame `let's end on a
  joke like a TV cop show' moment - best not go there... which is
  advice that holds for this entire trainwreck of a movie. Even a
  shockingly bland and uninspired Jerry Goldsmith score can't do
  anything for this one.</Text>
  <Text category="book">20 minutes into this movie I was disgusted by
  the terrible acting and the complete disregard for the book on
  which is it supposedly based. The actress playing Cleopatra
  protrays her as petulent, spoiled and immature, whereas in the
  book one saw Cleopatra as highly astute, regal, and concerned
  first about her country and its people. In the movie she handed
  Egypt to Ceasar eagerly, whereas in the book she refused to
  surrender anything to Rome. Likewise, Dalton portrays Ceasar as a
  complete ****. Perhaps if this were not based on Margaret
  George's Memiors of Cleopatra, I would be more kind in my review,
  but it pains me to think of the years of research wasted because
  of some second-rate film-maker's idea of good story-telling. At
  975 pages the book may be too meaty for most, but if you really
  want to learn about this queen, read the book instead.</Text>

  <Text category="book">I recently read Robert Monroe's first book,
  "Journeys Out of Body" and found it to be a disappointment - it
  was just weird. As I noted in my review of that book, I had hoped
  that the author would discuss his use of sound, for which he is
  allegedly noted. As I purchased this book at the same time and
  had nothing else to read, I thought I'd give it a try. The book
  did start out with a brief discussion of some of his "research"
  and I thought that, perhaps, this book might actually have some
  real substance. That belief; however, quickly disappeared. By the
  time I had reached the half-way point in the book, nothing
  remained but a schizophrenic quagmire of incomprehensible
  gibberish. How does total garbage like this manage to get
  printed?! There are those that claim that Monroe was a highly
  left-brained individual who delved into the realm of the creative
  right-brain. If this book is any indication, one can't help but
  wonder if Monroe was missing his entire left hemisphere! There is
  nothing logical or, for that matter, even coherent in the babble
  spewed across the endless pages of this book. It would have been
  worthwhile if Monroe had actually described his experiments and
  resulting data in a scientific manner. Instead, he chose to spew
  his incoherent ramblings about his own, personal, dream
  experiences: these wander so aimlessly, from paragraph to
  paragraph, that one can't help but wonder what real point, if
  any, he was trying to make. The really sad thing is that I had
  really hoped to find a genuinely scientific study of his work - I
  was actually quite interested in the topic. Having now been
  subjected to two of his useless books, I'm amazed that they're
  still in print. This is pseudo-science at its absolute
  worst.</Text>
  <Text category="book">I hate this book. It is extremely boring and

  <Text category="book">I had never read a Danielle Steel book before,
  and decided to give her a try, given that she is so popular and
  has so many books published. I was pretty disappointed. I agree
  with the other reviewers that the plot is unrealistic; however,
  if a book is unrealistic but well-written and engaging, I would
  still like it. I think the biggest problem with this book is the
  author's excessive repetitiveness. Yes, I get that this character
  is really cold and unloving---that was already covered 50 pages
  ago! In addition, character traits could have been better
  conveyed through situations, rather than simply stating, "so and
  so was a devoted mother" and repeating this fact again and again
  and again. These flaws in the author's writing kept me skipping
  through whole sections of the book. This book did not leave me
  wanting to read more of Ms. Steel's books. It is an ok book if
  you like romance and very easy, repetitive reading.</Text>
  <Text category="music">After discovering and loving the sound of
  Gotan Project I was shopping around for groups with a similar

  me spellbound, unfortunately, it was all downhill after that. I
  was listening to the cd for the first time in my car and forgot
  it was even on. The rest of the songs were so uninspiring, the
  music soon became nothing more than meaningless background

  <Text category="book">I have been a fan of Sue Henry since her first
  Jessie Arnold mystery. I was looking forward to reading her
  lastest adventure, but was very disappointed in this outing. The
  characters were one-dimensional. After discovering who the "bad
  guys" were I needed to reread part of the book for clarification.
  Sue Henry has a very annoying habit of foreshadowing at the end
  of many of her chapters. "...they hadn't a notion just how
  decidedly things could - and would - change in the next few
  hours." Even the relationship between Alex and Jessie seemed
  stilted. I realize it is difficult to create plausible mysteries
  for a civilian like musher Jessie Arnold, but this book tried too
  hard and accomplished too little</Text>
  <Text category="book">I am ashamed to say I read this entire book. I
  kept hoping it would get better but it didn't. It is filled with
  typos and poor organization of thoughts and topics. Clarkson
  actually spells Mel Gibson's name wrong several times throughout
  the book, and refers to Lethal Weapon director Richard Donner as
  "Dormer" for several pages! He jumps back and forth from one
  movie production to another making it difficult to follow.
  Lastly, he relies on the accounts of people who had met Mel
  Gibson at one time but who had either a personal or professional
  conflict with him. In the retelling of these conflicts and what
  went down, we hear one point of view only - and generally that is
  the view of someone who is harboring bitterness and resentment
  towards Gibson, so their accounts are slanted and untrustworthy.
  The best part of the book is the end for two reasons: Clarkson
  finally gets to Gibson's most recent project, The Passion of the
  Christ. The subtitle and the picture on the back of the book
  gives the impression this project will be a major focus of the
  book, but after 300 pages of reading, I was still waiting for the
  subject to come up. I have to say I felt that this was the only
  well written part of the whole book - thoughtful and interesting.
  The second reason the end is the best part of the book is that it
  was finally over. I'm sorry to be so blunt, but I can't help it.
  I highly recommend reading the book about the making of the
  Passion of the Christ - you can learn a lot about Gibson there -
  but I cannot recommend this biography</Text>

  <Text category="book">This novel could not hold my interest. I am an
  Anne Perry fan, but could not get into this book. I couldn't
  really bond with any of the characters and the plot was
  uninteresting. I'm really disappointed, because I was looking
  forward to a new series by her. Joseph and Matthew lost their
  parents to murder and Joseph lost two close friends to murder,
  yet there didn't seem to be much emotion. Maybe Ms. Perry tried
  to tell too many stories within one story. In reviewing the book,
  it's hard to pin point exactly why I didn't like this book. I
  would skip this series and read the Pitt series.</Text>

  band circa 1967. But if you weren't a Beatles fan then there is
  no reason for this. At least A Hard Days' Night with Richard

  <Text category="book">I have never been a fan of Danielle Steel's
  books and have only read a couple in my lifetime, and those many
  years ago. I'm not sure what motivated me to pick up Toxic
  Bachelors -- extreme boredom? insanity? -- but I slogged through
  it last night and have to say that it confirmed all my bad
  impressions of this writer's work. Actually, I think I was a
  little surprised by how awesomely bad it was. The writing was
  completely repetitive and superficial, and I rather felt that I
  was reading a treatment for a novel rather than the novel itself.
  It read like a poor book report: "...and then he did this, and
  then he did this, and after that he did this, and then he
  laughed." We are TOLD that the bachelors -- who struck me as
  commitment-phobic, a little neurotic, and fairly immature despite
  their (middle) age, but not necessarily toxic -- are decent,
  likable guys, but we never really see too much proof of that.
  When the "proof" does come, it's so ham-handed as to be
  laughable: Charlie's eyes well up with tears when he meets a
  young girl who was abused by her mother, and so we know that he
  truly does have a loving and compassionate soul and untold
  complexities to his character. Yeahsurerightwhatever. Most of the
  story is told through narration, with little bits and pieces of
  ho-hum dialogue. The author adopted a third-person point of view,
  but there's certainly nothing omniscient about it, and the reader
  is never sucked into the head of one of these characters.
  Throughout the book they remain about as interesting and
  dimensional as paper dolls, and their interactions with one
  another always struck me as being fairly unbelievable. THIS is
  how men behave and relate to one another? I find that hard to
  believe, considering that none of the men I know run around
  telling each other how much they love one another and how
  important they are to each other. I liked the female characters
  of the book initially. They all seemed to be strong, capable,
  independent and emotionally healthy women. But my opinion of each
  diminished greatly toward the end of the book, as each woman
  seemed all too willing to disregard her personal boundaries and
  put up with extreme schmuckiness from her man. And the conflicts
  Steel generated amongst the couples seemed ridiculous: mountains
  out of molehills. For instance, Gray, the 50-year-old artist who
  has always been phobic about family, refuses to meet the ADULT
  children of the woman he's been with for several months and whom
  he claims to love. Nevermind the fact that he's known about the
  ADULT children since the very beginning. Nevermind the fact that
  the ADULT children live in England and Italy, while Gray and
  Sylvia are New Yorkers. Nevermind the fact that they have their
  own lives and are independent, self-sufficient ADULTS who
  maintain their relationship with their mother through frequent
  phone calls and less frequent face-to-face visits. Evidently Gray
  can't see beyond the fact that they are "kids" and therefore
  "family" and therefore not to be tolerated. Sorry, but whatever
  sympathy I'd developed for Gray by this point disappeared
  altogether when confronted by this monstrous display of
  immaturity. Dump the weenie, Sylvia. You can do better. The other
  two guys had similar displays of gross ridiculousness, and of
  course everything was wrapped up magically, with sudden
  capitulation, as if the men had just suddenly come to their
  senses. Considering what little time and effort was spent on
  these characters, their conflicts and resolution, I have to
  wonder why Steel even bothered writing this book. And why I
  bothered reading i</Text>

  <Text category="toys_games">Santa got this castle for my five year old son
  for christmas. I agree with many of the other reviewers, though
  it is visually appealing it is very flimsy and was painstaking to
  put together. Despite all that my son seems to be enjoying. This
  toy is fun for the child but not for the parents.</Text>
  <Text category="music">This is the only album I own of Joe Strummer
  minus The Clash. I can't say it's very good. I hate having to
  compare it with it with his work with The Clash but it's
  inevitable. His lyrics aren't as great, edgy or provocative.
  There isn't any fantastic music either. I am not really sure what
  to say since I haven't listened to the album in so long because
  it was so bad, I truly tried my hardest to like it. But I feel it
  is my duty to advise others to not make the same mistake. Believe
  me: I absolutely love everything about The Clash, the lyrics,
  Joe's voice, the music, the attitude and how cool they were, this
  is not Joe at his best, it's cool though cause now he's gone: go
  buy some Bob Marley albums instead, Joe would not have
  minded</Text>
  <Text category="music">I am a BR5-49 aficionado from the early days
  at Robert's when the band played for tips and usually played
  requests until 2am with little or no breaks. Admittedly, I long
  for those days as much as I long for stirrups in Major League
  Baseball. So I'm nostalgic, "IT'S A FREE COUNTRY." It is also
  legal for a band to evolve and morph in any which way it feels.
  Yet, whenever I read a review in some fishwrap publication that
  states that a band has "matured," I can do nothing but cringe.
  Here's the flowchart: Band starts out - Band plays hard - Band
  gets cult following - Band gets reputation - Band strikes out on
  road - Band gets contract - Band gets a little more pub. - Band
  gets contract with bigger label - Band gets new management
  supplied by label - Band gets "coached" in next recording - Band
  changes faces along the way - Band changes label again - Band
  gets new direction from new label - Band fights for identity -
  Band produces new "mature" album - Band gets lost as cult finds
  new local acts beginning this process. Gee, I sure hope this
  isn't how the end of BR5-49 comes about, but enough of the doom
  and gloom of impending implosion. This record is OK. Of course, I
  realize that any band can't just re-hash the same 'ol stuff on
  every album, but part of what got these guys so much early
  attention was the raw exhuberance they displayed both live and on
  the vinyl. One part of this was their ability to do cover songs
  usually better than the originals, and a simple taste of this is
  what I sorely miss in the last few recordings. This band live
  used to be a wild, jittery, moving organism on stage, and
  although they are still a solid live show (saw them on the last
  tour at Poor David's Pub in Dallas), something has settled down.
  Chuck is a great talent, but an early appeal of the band was the
  vocal volley of Chuck and Gary Bennett. Ok, I'll go cry me a
  river, but dammit, just go listen to the Big Backyard Beat Show
  one more time. Mature? I just don't want to grow up that
  bad</Text>
  <Text category="book">Man, oh man, I think this is one of the worst
  books I've ever read. If I could give The Thanatos Syndrome
  negative stars, I would! Seriously, half way through, I came to
  Amazon to see how bad other people thought it was. Boy was I
  shocked to see that almost all of these reviews were positive! I
  found the book bizarre, unfocused and poorly written. The
  volcabulary repeatedly seems misused. The plot is not reasonable
  given the safeguards that US funding agencies have in place with
  regards to human experimentation. The physics, engineering,
  psychology, medical chemistry and biology are uninformed and
  unrealistic. Characters are introduced as though they will be
  important to the outcome, only to have them dissipate. And so on.
  The characters don't even seem like real people. For example, the
  main character recognizes his cousin by seeing her ankles - and
  only her ankles - flashing below a curtain, and yet he is
  apparently unaware of what degree of cousins they are. How could
  someone know a person that well, but still only have a vague idea
  of how they were related by blood? Or: one of the more reliable
  male characters blows duck hunting calls at women he finds
  attractive - as though he really thinks this will attract them.
  C'mon, if the guys a nut (and anyone who tries to seduce women by
  talking 'duck' to them is nuts!), write him as a nut the whole
  way through, don't make him the cornerstone of reliability at the
  book's climax! The book's title isn't even explained, for crying
  out loud. Thanatos means death in Greek, I believe, but I could
  never understand what the author/editors/audience thought was
  dying. I won't read this one again, nor will I look for anything
  else by Percy Walker.</Text>
  <Text category="health">I was disappointed in this product as the
  bonnet was smaller than the previous dryer I was using by Hot
  Tools and had problem getting on over my large rollers. After
  using about 5 times it stopped working. I will say that it is
  compact for travelling but feel that it is undependable. The
  temperature did get extremely hot so for a quick dry it was good
  from that standpoint. I ended up purchasing another Hot Tools
  Dryer, a little more money but worth the price in the long
  run</Text>
  <Text category="music">Even as a joke, this would be horrible;
  however, I think this band take it seriously - and it blows! I
  picked up this CD because I heard A.R.E. were like a combination
  of suicide, front 242, and iron maiden: Interesting. NO!! A.R.E.
  are a bad imitation of front 242 and watered-down Liars at best.
  The guitar riffs are awful and the lyrics are even worse.
  Example: "Hey World" begins with how much it sucks to be 13. When
  I saw Pelican in concert, they were opening (?!?!?) for A.R.E.,
  so I decided to give them a second chance. The sound guy must not
  have liked what he heard, because the bar chatter was louder.
  "Louder" I yelled, so that I might find something redeeming in
  their music. "Yeah, SUCK louder!" Someone else yelled - I had to
  agree &amp;amp; give him a high-five. Maybe I would have liked
  this when I was 12 and didn't know any better. ZERO STARS</Text>
  <Text category="book">I am soooo glad that I checked this out of the
  library and didn't pay for this garbage. I really should of
  listened to the reviews on this book before I wasted a day
  reading it. Actually, about half-way through I skimmed. The first
  couple chapters weren't bad, but the rest was just awful. Gracie,
  her ex-husband, her friends...they are the most pathetic, shallow
  bunch of fakes I've ever read about. What's even worse is that's
  the authors real life (maybe not the divorce part, but the rest
  of it). In the end, all I have to say is DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!!
  I should of listened to the others, but I didn't, and now I
  regret that I wasted so much time when I could of been reading
  something worth while.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I enjoy this genre of film, but found this one
  dull. It carries a rough smattering of supposedly sentimental and
  inspiring elements that are intended to create cohesion and a
  willing suspension of disbelief, but fall short of both aims. I
  actually groaned in response to the predictability, and shuttered
  at the stereotypes, which were mentioned in another review. At
  best, stereotypes of ignorant, aggressively dangerous, and
  perpetually struggling African and Hispanic American students who
  are lost in the world and can only be saved by a lovable, blue
  eyed, blonde-haired European American belle with superior life
  experience and intelligence are offensive. At worst, these
  stereotypes are haled as informative and inspiring. This movie
  has hit the worst in perpetuating stereotypes as both. Further,
  it fails to inspire thought or commentary on real racial,
  societal, and economic issues, which is what this genre of film
  is usually esteemed for.</Text>
  <Text category="health">I ordered this scale for a blind senior
  citizen. The English speaking voice has a British accent and is
  difficult to understand. The scale wobbles when you stand on it
  making you feel unstable, especially for someone with impaired
  eyesight</Text>
  <Text category="health">Ok, I'll admit, the nail clippers rock. I have
  no problem using them, they are sharp, cut evenly and are the
  perfect width. That said, throw everything else out. The bulb
  syringe is useless, keep the one that you get from the hospital.
  Get an ear thermometer, it's a heck of a lot easier. The
  spoon...not even going there. The med dropper isn't easy enough
  to use. My suggestion? Go find a syringe with a cork attachment.
  You take the top off the bottle, push the cork attachment into
  the opening. To use, flip back the attached lid and put the med
  syringe into the opening, flip the bottle over and draw the med
  into the syringe. This is the best way to do it.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I bought this toy for my shark-crazed 5
  year-old... she was so stoked and we prepped the tank, added the
  recommended water chemicals and dropped in two small goldfish.
  Less than 24 hours later, they were dead. Repeat... 40 hours
  later... same story. We tried a single Betta, Frank, but less
  than 4 days later... he's dead. We don't know what it is. The
  water was tested, it's fine. We think it is the overall design of
  the tank, could the tight-fitting lid be responsible? Possibly
  ammonia by-product buildup from the fish? Who knows. But we have
  given up and are dumping this promising toy into the trash
  bin</Text>
  <Text category="health">We got this guitar for my 4 year old, she
  loved it, but it stopped functioning after less than a month, I
  thought I need to change batteries but even after that it didn't

  so that I could return it, very disappointed...</Text>
  <Text category="book">This book is outdated for the 21st century.
  The basics are there and in great detail but most of the
  information is useless for today</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This item came in the mail and my 4 year old
  son and I were very excited. I guess we should have read the
  description more carefully because I wasn't expecting so many
  tiny little pieces. We used ticky tack and began the tedious
  process of sticking the different sized stars and such all over
  his room. We waited that night to see the glowing celestial
  extravaganza. We kept the light on for some time to 'charge' the
  glow in the dark element then turned off the light. What we found
  was nothing close to amazing. The glow was fairly dim and only
  lasted for a very short period of time. We even turned a
  blacklight on them and all that did was make them glow a little
  brighter but, again, the glow only lasted about 10 -15 minutes. I
  ended up going back online and buying glow in the dark paint and
  a star shaped sponge. We dabbed stars all over his ceiling. These
  glowing stars last most of the night and our friends and family
  think his room is really cool</Text>
  <Text category="music">Let's get one thing straight - Radiohead may
  be the greatest thing to happen to music since the Beatles. That
  said, this is not the album for that reason. Do not let this
  album turn you off from Radiohead...beacause it is truly not what
  they are about. There is one hint though in where Radiohead will
  go. In the song "Creep", which is not a fantastic song, there is
  a brilliant "CHU-CHUNK" made by Johnny Greenwood. SO PLEASE - IF
  YOU ARE TRYING TO GET INTO RADIOHEAD...GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. For the
  "rockers" - get THE BENDS, for people trying to expand their
  musical mind - get OK COMPUTER, and if you like that you may
  become obsessed with KID A. There are some unbelievable songs on
  AMNESIAC, but it is not their most cohesive album, and HAIL TO
  THE THEIF is very solid. Thank you for your time</Text>
  <Text category="music">I was disappointed when I received this CD.
  Although it is original, the music is hard for me to listen for
  more than a minute or two. By your side, (my favorite) is good
  for about two minutes. Then the beat gets off track, and starts
  to sound terrible. If this was done on purpose, I cannot fathom
  why. I know this is "lo-fi", but a hint of bass wouldn't hurt at
  all. As it stands, the CD sounds like an unfinished product, and
  is not nearly good enough to stand on its own. I think this CD
  would best be used for some sampling...especially in today's
  hip-hop. If you are looking for beautiful, relaxing music...look
  elsewhere</Text>
  <Text category="book">Unfortunately there are not much words to
  loose. Poor writing together with the fact that practically all
  facts were lifted from Cameron's 'Conversation with Wilder' which
  is highly recommended btw, make this book forgettable. Why going
  through the whole exercise of publishing it is quite a
  mystery</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">this movie was awfull. supertroopers was
  awsome and beerfest was even better, so i suppose they can be
  forgiven for this cinematic abortion</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I bought this for our 3yo son who loves heavy
  equipment and digging in the dirt. This is a cool toy as far as
  being a pretty good replica of a real one but it does not work
  well in dirt or sand. Fine sediment gets caught in tracks and
  after a short amount of time, the tracks quit turning. Then the
  handles on the arm do not move the bucket well. My son has since
  ripped off the tracks and does not do any digging with it but
  still enjoys pushing it around. Don't buy this if you want your
  kid to actually dig dirt, it would be good inside toy or outside
  but away from dirt or sand. But, I think it was intended for
  playing in these areas, so the rig is not that well
  designed.</Text>
  <Text category="music">There's a review here that compares Hank III
  with Hank, and then suggests that Hank III adds to the legend
  with his clever lyrics. I think that person has never listened to
  Hank's stuff. It's hard to compete with, "You wore out a brand
  new trunk, packin' and unpackin' all of your junk." That's my
  favorite Hank lyric, and there are many, many more--very, very
  clever, very hard to compete with. That said, I love III. He has
  a hard way to go, and apparently he's going it. I can't even
  imagine the dichotomy he faces--looking and sounding like Hank,
  and I'm sure he loves that, yet wanting to do his own stuff. I
  bought his first CD as soon as I knew about it, and I've been
  waiting for this one. On the first one I was disappointed with
  his writing (but he's a kid, for pete's sake) and was knocked out
  by Wayne Hancock. On the other hand--I didn't know III existed
  until I saw him on Conan O'Brian, and he was one of those
  performers who makes your head whip around and hit the "record"
  button so you can find out who he is. I've listened to everything
  on Lovesick Broke &amp;amp; Driftin' and I love it. Except for
  Atlantic City--once you've heard The Band do that, you don't need
  anything else. Hank III, however, is on his way, and I'm rooting
  for him. He's got the stuff. (And, by the way, to echo the
  sentiments of others on this board, I don't listen to country
  anymore, at all! It's way too pop-commercial-boring-who cares!) I
  haven't listened to a country station for more than 10 years. Go,
  III.</Text>
  <Text category="music">These guys were the nirvana of r&amp;amp;b,
  motown, soul, black music in the 90s. As nirvana was the band
  that ended good white music. boyz to men was the band that ended
  good black music. I am kinda pissed because nobody seems to
  notice it like i do. These guys especially the lead singer would
  always sing, oh wah oh wah oh oh ohhh oh after every sentence. I
  mean compare these guys to kool and the gang or the commodores or
  rick james. i could name tons and im not really a fan of soul
  type music. barry white, whitney houston, bobby brown, the
  temptations Isaac hayes luther vandross. i mean in the 90s i
  think almost every r&amp;amp;b group was better than boyz to
  girls. i dont understand why these guys are so popular. I guess
  its just like seinfeld it sucks bad but people like it. its like
  all these idiots were born yesterday forgetting about quality
  music and sitcoms from the past that were better.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I bought the happy co electric head tripper
  for my husband for Christmas. He has wanted ones that we've seen
  in the mall, so this seem to be a good one. Well, the plastic
  pieces that fit into the slot were very flemsy. We had to be
  careful not to snap it trying to get it in. Once we got it in,
  the head tripper felt great. It really did send goosebumps down
  my spine. THe only problem is the purple plastic piece broke off,
  litterally the next day after giving it to him. It first was bent
  and then finally broke all the way off. I do not recommend this
  product. I was thinking of getting the ting ting motorized head
  massager to replace them. You can still use the happy head
  tripper it is just one tong short</Text>
  <Text category="book">This year, 60% of college entries will be

  <Text category="health">Not only did this phone not work, but the
  screen was really quite tiring on my eyes. The only ringtone that
  it had was a sound like beads being shaken up. The flashing light
  was distracting, and its features were extraordinarily limited!
  The camera option didn't work at all, and where the heck was the
  texting??? My parents bought this phone for me for my birthday,
  and it really made me mad!! I can see that this might be a good
  starter phone, but you can only get 0 calls froim it, and really
  limited reception in the mountains. Switch to a Razr as soon as
  possible</Text>
  <Text category="book">A singularly dull book, the characterizations
  seemed flat and the peg on which the novel is hung, a South
  victorious with modern weapons, seemed too trivial. The author
  has to make something compelling in that conceit or for the
  reader the book will mean nothing. Unfortunately there seems
  little real purpose to the idea unless one finds the
  characterizations of historical figures believable and they are
  not. The character of Robert E. Lee in the book is just too, too
  good to be sympathetic or even credible and the stock characters
  that pop up to lend support seem like cardboard cutouts. I
  finally felt that the book was going in such an obvious direction
  that I put it down halfway through. I am not sure if it turns out
  the way I think but frankly there was nothing in the first half
  of the book to make me care one way or the other</Text>
  <Text category="health">Hard to follow instructions, I ended up

  <Text category="dvd">As cute and talented as I think Hugh Jackman
  is, this production was a waste of time, space and money.
  Everyone involved in this feature should be ashamed of
  themselves. The acting is bad, the script is horrendous and the
  CG people apparently think their stuff don't stink...which it
  does-badly. It's not the worse movie I've seen, but it's
  surprisingly close. Please don't waste your time with this
  film</Text>
  <Text category="health">I wanted to buy this for my daughter. I wanted
  to combine a traditional record book with fill-ins with my new

  <Text category="health">I finally got this toothbrush after I have

  the replacements for the brush are too expensive. No thank

  would not allow me to press any other button to start the heat
  process. I plugged and unplugged the unit several times with
  several long time increments each time. I also tried holding down
  all of the hear setting buttons for several seconds, sometimes
  two or three at once. Nothing worked. Its was nice while it

  <Text category="music">Any group that is so lacking in imagination

  make it through unscathed. I'm confident we'll

  major in college and a medical student now, I've read many
  scientific books written in scientific language. So many that
  they are pretty much all I can relate to anymore. HA! Actually,
  that statement has more truth in it than I care to admit, but I
  thought this book would be a nice change of pace. Instead, it's a
  listing of information about a certain bacterial species that I
  could have extracted from Bergey's. The book is undramatic and
  uninteresting. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone</Text>
  <Text category="music">While I like some of these songs, I cannot
  understand a single word he sings. I even heard him interviewed
  and I didn't understand a word. When he sings, he spends all the

  has stage presence and I think it will be hard to grow a fan base
  with a singer who can't form words. He doesn't sing clearly and I
  just can't get into his music completely. I think I'll stick to
  R&amp;amp;B</Text>

  <Text category="music">This album was released in 1999. And now,
  seven years later, this album does not even matter. Britney
  Spears is remembered not for her musical talent but for her
  inability to parent a child. Great music lasts dozens of years
  for its complexity, innovation, creativity, and ability to
  transcend cultures and generations. Great music stirs something
  inside the listener, and matters to the person who created it.
  Britney Spears and the ridiculous product that her record
  companies have created is none of these things. It saddens me to
  see the number of copies an album such as this sells originally.
  And yet, the great albums of all times sell thousands of copies
  years - decades, even - after their release. Music like this,
  Britney Spears and her peers, disappears into the folds of time.
  It does not matter.</Text>

  <Text category="music">Rob touches on so much with this CD. My
  favorite song is one that hasn't got any airplay and, in my
  opinion, the public missed out a great hit! "Streetcorner
  Symphony" is about people coming together. It's what I call my
  happy song. Each day as I go to work I play the song as loud as I
  can get it! We, my daughters and I, saw him live and he also
  called it a happy song! I can't wait for his live albulm to come
  out! There are fast and slow songs on this CD and will be worth
  EVERY PENNY you spend to buy it! Incredible voice and
  songwritting</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I found this toy to be a waste of money. It

  <Text category="book">If you want the why and the wherefore ... stay

  <Text category="health">I have bought quite a few barbies from Amazon
  recently, including the caligirl series, fashion fever series,
  and barbie loves micky mouse. This barbie is quite different to
  all above. She does not have a rubber skin like others, so we may
  see her leg joints if she is wearing a skirt or shorts. Her foot
  is quite flat; only the slippers in this package fit her; all
  other barbies' shoes do not. I guess this "pooh" might be made
  with the "former generation" technology</Text>
  <Text category="health">I was disappointed getting this product
  because I've read the previous reviews and the majority have
  written positive feedback on this hair iron. I actually prefer
  the cheaper Conair's ceremanic irons w/o the wet on/off feature
  over this one. It doesn't clamp down well on my hair (I've got
  thick frizzy hair). The results for me aren't that great, it
  straightens my hair a little but it's still frizzy. It's
  lightweight which is nice. I don't care for the wet hair option
  because it takes me twice as long to straighten my hair. I
  definitely prefer other models over this one.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Ok, maybe that's a bit strong, but this is
  hands down our most hated toy (by the adults, and the kids are
  plenty frustrated, too). We received it as a gift (and WOW
  whoever would pay $35 for this is CRAZY.). Our son is nearly five
  &amp;amp; needs help to load the truck, which has to be loaded
  fully to work without jamming; a time-consuming procedure, since
  the dominoes have to be loaded one-at-a-time. The dominoes
  themselves are also almost too lightweight to stand well on end,
  and are prone to easy collapse. After the initial newness wears
  off this toy is going to disappear, and that's something I've
  never even contemplated before</Text>

  <Text category="toys_games">This game is heavily developed based on the
  actual movie. If you haven't seen the movie, and/or your kid was
  too young to understand the plot, then they might not get the
  game. Most of the adventures are based on the story plot. A lot
  of the adventures are a bit dumb, like McQueen bumping alphabet
  tires into a truck, McQueen tipping over the tractors based on
  counting smoke rings, McQueen herding the tractors back into the
  pen, McQueen driving down a long road and picking up shapes,
  McQueen driving down a road looking for Mack based on memory,
  McQueen dodging the firetruck water blast, etc. The only
  adventure I liked was the forklift picking up tire numbers (odd
  vs. even) and installing them on the race car. Don't buy this
  game unless your kid is obsessed with Cars</Text>
  <Text category="book">Growing CPs from seed is not easy! And growing
  CPs in a terrarium is even harder (they need full sun, wet soil,
  and a special soil mix). They grow native from Texas through the
  Carolinas and do not need the tropical environment of a terrarium
  where fungus will attack and kill. This terrarium set up is
  doomed to failure. CPs are actually very easy to grow outdoors
  with a little proper instruction. Obtain your plants or seeds
  (takes years to get a decent plant via seeds) from a reputable
  online nursery (I have bought several excellent plants from
  Sarracenia Northwest) and then search the web for proper growing
  instructions. Skip this item and the goofy terrarium domes at
  Walmart.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I saw this at a friends house--so thank God I

  any good review you read was written by someone with a financial

  that matter. The acting is terrible. Please...anyone who had

  <Text category="dvd">I could barely get through
  the...um...er...reimagination...of the childern's classic - while
  the set design and special FX are state of the art, as usual for
  a Tim Burton film, the actual movie is hard to watch. Why? Depp's
  "performance" is chock full of ticks and mannerisms, off-putting,
  flat, self-absorbed, and finally, one-note. Rather than the
  quirky fun of the original 1972 Gene Wilder version, Burton's
  film is more horror than fantasy, often casually cruel and
  sadistic to the point of being far from family fare. While
  deliberate on Burton's part, that doesn't make the final product
  any more watchable. It's one grim, dismal, downward spiral slog.
  Not much holidday fun, huh? As with most of Burton's other big,
  expensive failures, he knows how to CREATE a convincing world,
  but has no clue how to POPULATE it with characters and situations
  we identify with and/or could care less about. The final result
  is a film that's like a fragile, hermetically sealed curio on the
  shelf - nice to look at from afar, but hard to get attached to,
  much less involved with. What a waste of millions of studio
  $$$</Text>
  <Text category="music">Not his best stuff. He's running short of
  lyrical ideas, he recycles his own lines, like Star Wars recycles
  "I have a bad feeling about this". Beats are usually cool, I
  don't care for the popish tracks with the singing. I didn't mind
  it so much when he sang REALLY BAD back on his first album, but
  now it's no longer funny, it sounds like pop. Anyhow, organized
  religion is crap. I thought KRS understood this back in the day.
  What happened? Now he's got his own little organization and his
  own little phylosophy, and his only little diciples and crap, I
  dunno, it's posative, but then again it's gay like some of his
  modern tracks. Anyhow it is cheap, if you have to finish off your
  collection as I do, then buy it, otherwise go buy his anything
  BoomBap on back. Or check out: Kool Keith El-P Gang Starr Mr. Lif

  <Text category="music">I don't even own this CD, and after seeing the
  reviews I don't want it. 90% of the "5 star" reviews are people
  with ONLY ONE review. Suspicious?? Look for yourself, it's right
  there to see. I have some other meditation CDs that are very
  repetitive, I'm not going to make the same mistake here,
  especially with such SHAMELESS self-promotion</Text>
  <Text category="music">Hmm... Ok, maybe it was not the best reason to
  want to buy this CD, but I heard one of the songs on it,
  Hashkiveynu, performed (partially) during an episode of the West
  Wing, and it sounded AMAZING (it was NOT the same cantor as on
  this CD). I am not Jewish and not even very spiritual, but I
  wanted to have that song in my collection. I immediately searched
  the web for the info, got the name of the chant and found this
  CD. I almost purchased it without listening, when I found a
  different site, where they actually have rather long excerpts (2
  min.) of most tracks, so I listened to them. Boy, was I relieved
  and disappointed at once! Relieved that I didn't buy the CD and
  disappointed that I couldn't get the song I wanted (I was willing
  to buy a whole CD for just 1 song, that's how much it impressed
  me). The song sounds very little like the one from the West Wing,
  although I do believe that the site where I found the info
  speficially pointed to this CD as having a recording of the same
  song used in the show. And I'm sorry to say it but the voice also
  doesn't hold a candle to the one used on the show - way too
  "operatic", as mentioned by many, and harsh and even
  unpleasant-sounding to me. It took all the charm and candor right
  out of the song (in the show, they had a much more natural voice
  do the song). I also agree that the choir does not mesh well with
  the soloist. If anyone knows where and if I can purchase a
  recording of this song done by a different singer (if it can be
  the one from the West Wing, I'll be thrilled), please, let me
  know. In the meantime, I'm passing on this CD..</Text>

  about redoing a song about or with a dead rapper, BUT YOU

  <Text category="health">These hair topia pills are nothing but
  garbage! Pure nonsense! Trust me, I know this because I used to
  buy them. I first bought these pills last year in June 2005 after
  hair formula 37's unsuccessful promise of producing longer and
  stronger hair in the four months of usage. Well, these pills were
  not as expensive as the previous brand mentioned, and had
  promised also to change dry and brittle hair to long and healthy,
  and it did absolute NOTHING. I said to myself, like hair formula
  37, that maybe I just need to give this more time, so I bought a
  2-month supply and gave it 3 months in all and there was no
  difference at all. This product might just work for others, which
  it has, but it certainly didn't work for me. I must admit that I
  brought this on myself, as my mother warned me not to buy these
  ridiculously expensive pill since they do nothing for hair that
  grows naturally anyway, and that if you really want to get hair
  pills then just buy them a whole lot cheaper in regular stores
  like Giant or even hair vitamins in the damn Dollar Store! These
  hair growth pills are too damn expensive, so when you are paying
  all of that money then you expect it to work. The fact that it
  does not is infuriating because $39.99 + $7 in shipping, with a
  total of a little over $46, is a lot of money to spend on
  something that does nothing. Thus, I am here to warn others not
  to waste their precious money. And if you are going to, please
  don't do it on this site-you can buy this product a little
  cheaper at hairboutique.com.</Text>
  <Text category="book">I read this short novel because I greatly
  admired Shaara's Pulitzer Prize winning "Killer Angels," and
  because I'm a baseball fan. The novel feels more like an outline
  or first draft than a completed work about an aging pitcher. It's
  a bit shallow and predictable in its plot. The characters are
  what one expects in all too many sports novels and short stories.
  The feel or atmosphere just isn't quite there. Any baseball fan
  will see flaws in the book right away, flaws that distract and
  damage the work. Shaara sets most of the novel in Yankee Stadium
  with the Hawks playing the Yankees. Why the author chose to have
  one real team against a fictional team is unclear. The Hawks
  apparently are from Atlanta, but an Atlanta team, Braves or
  Hawks, whichever, would not be playing the Yankees interleague on
  the next to last day of the season. Finally, when a visiting
  pitcher goes out to warm up before the game, he does so in the
  semi-hidden bull pen down the left field line in Yankee
  Stadium--not on the mound on the field. This book was published
  posthumously and Mr. Shaara perhaps never had a chance to polish
  his prose--prose that was excellent in "Killer Angels." It's
  unfortunate. There are glimmers of interest in the book, but not
  enough to recommend it to baseball fans or fans of the author's
  other book</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I've seen several pretty funny comedies this
  year, but none of them could touch what I watched Saturday night.
  This DVD had it all, slapstick, funny costumes, hilarious sight
  gags, geeky dancing and more. There were times I was laughing so
  hard that my stomach hurt. I just couldn't stop laughing and in
  fact spent most of the show with tears rolling down my cheeks. It
  was so funny, that I felt at a couple of points I was going to
  lose control of my bowels. Yes, it's THAT funny. I highly
  recommend this one, as it's the closest thing I've seen to the
  classic Monty Python days of English humor. I don't know when I
  saw a movie that was non-stop hilarity, without a single moment
  of serious content. Over two hours of complete madcap behaviour
  and a near fatal dose of cheese. The name of the DVD? Castles
  &amp;amp; Dreams, by an English comedy troupe called "Blackmore's
  Night". These guys are like a combination of Monty Python, Benny
  Hill and Marty Feldman. My sides are still aching..... Those

  <Text category="toys_games">I purchased this coffee maker for my 3 yr. old
  son who loves to role play with the real coffee maker we have. He
  was very excited about having his "own" coffee maker, however
  after only a few days it quit working. The lights and sound still
  work but the water won't run anymore, he was very disappointed as
  this was his favorite part of the toy. He still enjoys playing

  <Text category="book">I love Heinlein. I think that he has a unique
  voice and perspective in the world of science fiction. I find
  that his plots and ideas are inventive. Even this story was
  inventive in many ways, like some of the business ideas in
  regards to the new source of energy in the first chapters.
  However, I found this book as a whole to be very boring. Much of
  this is due to the lack of fully fleshed characters. The
  &amp;amp;quot;main&amp;amp;quot; characters of each section of
  the book aren't fully realized at all. I wouldn't recommend this
  book unless you picked it up for free and were really, really

  <Text category="dvd">HYPOCRISY ALERT! HYPOCRISY ALERT! I just
  wanted to get that out of the way right at the start. Not more
  than twenty-four hours ago I wrote a review waxing philosophic on
  the state of the modern horror film. I argued that fans shouldn't
  viciously tear apart every movie they find objectionable because
  the current spate of horror films is better than no horror films
  at all. In other words, we should accept the bad with the good
  rather than stop renting and thus face a potential drought of
  horror movies. Now that I have gotten that out of the way, I
  shall proceed to trash "Adam &amp;amp; Evil." I didn't set out to
  heap scorn on this film when I popped it in the DVD player a few
  weeks ago, although a cursory glance at the cover art sent a
  chill of disappointment through my body and I felt my heart
  sinking. In fact, nothing screams "straight to video" more loudly
  than a film entitled "Adam &amp;amp; Evil." Well, perhaps
  something like "Adam &amp;amp; the Bollweevil," or even "Adam
  &amp;amp; Evil Knievel" might rank as likelier candidates, but
  you get the idea. "Adam &amp;amp; Evil" does not inspire
  confidence that I'm about to watch a slasher film on par with
  Carpenter's "Halloween." Right from the start of the film we
  learn the filmmakers have cast us into the ninth circle of
  clichï¿½d slasher film hell. The movie introduces
  us to the typical bunch of young airheads getting ready to embark
  on a camping trip out in the sticks. There is Seth (Kevin
  Robson), the goofy virgin who tries too hard with the ladies but
  hopes that the trip will finally cure him of his unwanted
  condition. Then there is the snotty and narcissistic brunette
  Yvonne (Erica Cerra). Next up is a staple of every poorly made
  horror film, the ever important "loud guy" Matt (Brody Harms).
  Along for the ride are Evelyn (Barbara Kottmeier), Adam himself
  (Sean Arnfinson), Adam's girlfriend Yvette (Lynsey Brothers), and
  a few other kids. I am willing to bet that as you look at this
  list you will notice the Eve connotation in the three girls'
  names, and that Seth is also a name pulled straight out of the
  Old Testament. Where Matt comes in is a mystery unless we look to
  the New Testament. Something tells me the Matthew responsible for
  the gospel didn't go around announcing to everyone who would
  listen that he wanted to be known as "Matt." Call it a gut
  feeling. Anyway, these dolts head out to the forest for a few fun
  filled days of gossip, drinking, and romping around in the water.
  Sounds familiar, doesn't it? See those bright objects moving in
  your peripheral vision? They're called red flags. Things get a
  little tense when they stop off at a local bar populated with the
  usual Hollywood redneck stereotypes in order to ask some
  questions only to discover that the locals, with the exception of
  the busty wife of the local sheriff, aren't interested in helping
  out. Too, a creepy park custodian stumbles into the campground
  and gives everyone a scare before scurrying back into the forest.
  If you think we'll see him again before the credits roll, that's
  one bet I won't take. I should also mention a couple of other
  potential stresses facing the group. Adam and his friend Matt did
  something quite idiotic a few years before--namely setting a
  house ablaze with fireworks that claimed the lives of the family
  living there--that continues to haunt them to this day. Too, one
  of the gals worries about a stalker boyfriend she recently broke
  up with. Both of these scenarios serve to provide us with
  potential red herrings in order to make the film more
  suspenseful. I laugh defiantly at such nonsense. I won't spoil
  the ending for you, but I will take a few seconds to describe the
  incredibly banal lead up to the "twist" ending. For a slasher
  film, "Adam &amp;amp; Evil" is downright puritanical with the red
  stuff. I felt like a bizarro Clara Peller hollering, "Where's the
  gore?" every time a killing went down. Seth, for example,
  perishes in his tent in a particularly bloodless, off camera
  fashion. A couple of the other kids meet their maker when they
  run into the killer while floating around on a raft in a pond,
  again a rather bloodless affair. The presence of a bow and arrows
  and a shed full of sharp instruments promised great things--a
  promise unfulfilled, unfortunately. "Adam &amp;amp; Evil" is one
  of the tamest slashers I have ever seen. What did they do, turn
  the script over to the Hayes Commission before shooting scenes?
  Note to aspiring filmmakers: if you're going to make a low budget
  slasher film that will never see a theatrical release, go over
  the top with the sauce. At least then you've got a shot at making
  a cult classic. And another thing: make sure you pick people with
  a modicum of acting skills instead of the mannequins posing as
  living beings in this film. Sure, you'll have to shell out a few
  more bucks, but it's worth it. Remember, unless I'm laughing so
  hard at the bad acting that the film achieves the coveted "so bad
  it's good" label, ham handed performances can only hurt you.
  Surprisingly, the DVD comes with a commentary track. Not that
  you'll want to listen to it, but there it is. We also get a few
  trailers for three other schlock films: "Contagion," "Hallow's
  End," and "Asylum Days." Forget about picking up a copy of "Adam
  &amp;amp; Evil." It's not the sort of film a hardcore horror fan
  wants friends to see prominently displayed on the movie shelf.
  There are plenty of other worthier slashers out there that demand
  your attention.</Text>
  <Text category="music">There is not much I can add to these reviews
  here. Just like me, a lot of people here were dissapointed
  because of the fact that so many classic 2Pac songs were remixed
  only to sound like disasters. Why would such an abomination
  happen? Suge Knight is trying to milk the Pac legacy until it is
  bone dry. Well at least he has done something right if you ask
  me. It sucks that this is how we are forced to remember Tupac
  Shakur, over tracks chopped up into this. Die hard Pac fans won't
  even like this, if they haven't heard it already. I'm so waiting
  for a remix album of "The Chronic" and "Doggystyle". If Suge
  Knight was smart you would reissue Tha Dogg Pound's "Dogg Food"
  on dual disc, because that is the only reason why I don't have
  that album yet.</Text>

  <Text category="music">Before you buy, be sure to check where the pen
  was made. I have a number of older Cross pens that say "USA" near
  the top, and they are great pens. However, I have bought three
  different ones in the past few years that do not indicate where
  they were made, and they are of inferior quality. The top and
  bottom halves are loose, and have to be carefully manipulated to
  come together without a gap. The first one I got, I sent it back
  to Cross for warranty repair under their "lifetime guarantee,"
  only to receive it back unchanged telling me that it was just
  fine - and a "handling fee" attached. I was willing to believe it
  was simply an anomaly, one bad pen. So later on when some new
  colors came out, I bought two more - only to see that they have
  the same quality defect. My advice: if you want a good Cross pen,
  go to the secondhand store and buy one that was made in USA. They
  aren't making them the same anymore.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I purchased this movie for my 7 year old twin

  I remember Transformers when I was growing up and I certainly do
  not remember their being foul language in the cartoons. I am

  <Text category="music">I woke up this morning to the grating sounds

  Like You Were Dying". "Good Little Girls" is easily the worst
  country song I've ever heard - and I thought Neal McCoy was bad!

  <Text category="dvd">The Decalogue is one of several excellent TV
  series by European directors that puts US TV to shame. Like
  Bergman's "Scenes from a Marriage" &amp;amp; "Fanny &amp;amp;
  Alexander," von Trier's "The Kingdom," Fassbinder's "Berlin
  Alexanderplatz," Kusturica's "Underground," and Petersen's "Das
  Boot," The Decalogue was initially conceived as a series on
  television and eventually brought to US viewers' attention on the
  large screen via a limited art house run. Unlike these other
  series, Kieslowski's was conceived as ten separate stories that
  were only tied together by the fact that the stories all involved
  people in the same housing block (and characters from one episode
  may pop up in another). The stories of The Dekalog are morality
  plays, but they are not re-enactments of The Ten Commandments,
  but rather inspired by them, and ultimately it is left to the
  viewer to decide the connection between the two. Kieslowski
  &amp;amp; Piesiewicz wrote the ten screenplays and decided to do
  the 10 stories themselves (instead of contracting 10 of Poland's
  best up &amp;amp; coming director's to do each, as was initially
  planned), and instead hired a different cinematographer for each
  of the stories. I won't comment on the content of the stories as
  many have already done so, and I feel that that would minimizes
  the impact of the experience of watching them, so I will comment
  on Kieslowski's style. Kieslowski has stated that his intent is
  to highlight personal consequences of a dramatic nature. His
  films often tackle issues of political import, however he
  intentionally avoids making "issue films," but rather focuses on
  the personal consequences of those affected, as he feels that
  politics solves nothing &amp;amp; that films do not really change
  the political culture. His views on film stem from his experience
  as a director who stayed in Poland before, during &amp;amp; after
  the Solidarity movement. Initially he started as a documentary
  film maker, but as he saw that audiences were more interested in
  fiction and that documentary film-making has an impact on the
  lives of its subjects, he switched to his unique fictional style.
  This Facets 3-disc set of The Dekalog is apparently an
  improvement over the 2-disc version previously available, in that
  the picture quality is a little better, however it is still a far
  cry from what it could have been if Criterion had released this
  series. First, Facets has a mandatory ad for itself that
  automatically plays when you insert a disc &amp;amp; you have to
  let it play out before you can get to the menu. To add to that,
  you also have to watch another ad each and every time you select
  an episode to watch &amp;amp; after the end of each episode, very
  annoying. Then the picture quality isn't as good as it could be.
  Not only is there evidence of flaws in the film (scratches and
  blotches), but the film isn't a true digital copy of the original
  series, but rather a copy of someone's PAL tape of the broadcast,
  so the image is no better than watching a VHS tape. The picture
  is also cropped from the original, especially on the bottom. The
  picture at times jitters, especially during the ending credits.
  The English subtitles are minimal, at times missing dialogue, and
  can not be turned off. There are some nice extra features,
  particularly a broadcast from Polish television of an interview
  of Kieslowski with a number of Polish journalists. However the
  quality of the picture of this is worse than on The Dekalog, and
  the entire dialogue is spoken over by people in English with no
  option to turn of the English dub &amp;amp; use subtitles
  instead. Apparently all of the other (imported) editions of The
  Dekalog are of better quality &amp;amp; offer more extras than
  this edition, which is inexcusable given the price</Text>
  <Text category="book">True, there are many controversies raging
  about copying DVDs and copyrights. I suspect we are in a
  transition zone with all this and "the industry" will figure out
  how to help people love and cherish their DVDs rather than simply
  calling everyone a pirate. Having said that, I can also
  understand why an author of such a book wouldn't want to "say too
  much" about this controversy, especially if he his looking over
  his shoulder at "the lawyers." I was trying to think of an
  analogy to express my disapointment in this book (and this isn't
  a good one) but it goes like this: You want to go to Israel and
  you buy a book on "Israel for Dummies" and you search for
  something, anything on the controversy of the wall they are
  building. But instead of finding a discussion of the controversy
  you find a few off-handed quips about "There's a wall going up
  and it's causing some controversy. 'Nuff said." "'Nuff said"?
  Hel-lo? Were dummies out here, that's why we bought the dumb
  book! There might be some useful information for some people, but
  I was sorely disappointed</Text>
  <Text category="book">I truly wanted to like this book. After years
  of avoidance I had just finished Moby Dick and found it not only
  more readable than I'd feared but downright enjoyable. In
  addition I'd heard nothing but good things about this novel whose
  premise certainly intrigued me, and like its predecessor it has
  one of the truly great opening lines in literature: "Captain Ahab
  was neither my first husband nor my last." Alas, it was all down
  hill from there; overall this is one of the worst books I've ever
  forced myself to finish. This came as quite a surprise because
  the author is no untalented hack. Author of two other published
  novels and a short story collection, director of a university
  level creative writing program, long-term teacher of writing, and
  holder of a Ph.D. in same, all to considerable critical acclaim,
  she should be correcting and grading (failing) garbage like this
  not producing it. So what went wrong? How did this novel end up
  so awful? The answer is brick by brick and piece by piece. There
  is no one great thing wrong with it but rather a lot of little
  things. LENGTH: If "brevity is the soul of wit", this novel's
  witlessness is easily explained. At 666 pages (interesting number
  that) this novel is about three times as long as it should have
  been. It would seem that, to some extent like Melville before
  her, Naslund confused Length with Importance, but Melville was a
  lot more skilled at padding than she is. IMHO this desire to fill
  too many pages made many of the other problems worse by allowing
  Naslund both to go into unnecessary detail about things no one
  else cares about and to repeat herself to the point of
  self-parody. Somewhere under the barnacle encrustations may be
  the finely lined hull of a short novel, but this was a manuscript
  desperately in need of editing... with a meat axe or a chainsaw.
  THE NAME DROPPING: One of the pleasures of any historical novel
  is the encounters between fictional characters and historical
  figures, but if badly handled these encounters can un-suspend
  disbelief and downright offend. They are badly handled here. An
  almost uneducated hick from the backwoods of Kentucky encounters
  by chance a significant number of the thoughtful elites of
  mid-nineteenth century New England and those she doesn't utterly
  charm with her brilliance and erudition she gets the better of as
  in her unintentionally hilarious encounter with Naslund's
  peculiar imagining of Nathaniel Hawthorne. One or two of these,
  developed at greater length could have added to the
  verisimilitude. As it is, it is a Zelig or a Forrest Gump without
  the humor (or the self-awareness). THE POLITICS: Even the most
  conservative readers would probably find the popular views of a
  majority of mid-nineteenth century New Englanders a bit
  disconcerting if espoused straight in a modern novel, so a
  certain amount of modernizing would be appropriate just to reduce
  the cringing. However, Naslund takes this to the opposite extreme
  by having Una espouse the Politically Correct view on every
  single controversy of the day (and some that only exist in our
  significantly sillier day) from slavery to whaling, from feminism
  to free love, from homosexuality to sensitivity towards the
  differently abled, all without consequence or even criticism.
  This latter is the most offputting because to have actually
  championed such views back then would have taken considerable
  courage whatever one thinks of the ideas themselves. Una espouses
  them with all the negative consequences that Naslund receives for
  espousing them today, which is to say: none. THE ANTI-CHRISTIAN
  BIGOTRY: There is nothing so very wrong with characters in a
  mid-nineteenth century novel exhibiting agnosticism or atheism as
  both views were gaining more and more credence at the time, but
  it is downright silly to suggest that such views would have been
  widely accepted. It is even sillier to portray Christianity as
  something confined exclusively to the foolish, the bigoted, the
  future apostate, or the mentally ill. It tells us more about the
  author than anything else that Una is openminded towards every
  religious and quasi-religious idea of the time EXCEPT
  Christianity. THE FARFETCHED SCENARIOS: I sensed the novel was in
  trouble during the opening scene in which Una loses both her
  mother and her baby but manages to withstand this blow by making
  friends with a runaway slave with whom she has a quasi-lesbian
  encounter.... After this the novel goes into flashback and
  becomes unrealistic. After her crazy Christian father threatens
  to kill her (a sentiment the reader will come to know and
  understand), Una is raised in a lighthouse by her ludicrously
  liberal-minded aunt and uncle, encounters two young men who both
  fall in love with her, disguises herself as a cabin boy and sails
  on the same whaler with them, successfully avoids detection, is
  sunk by a whale, survives by committing cannibalism, marries the
  surviving young man after he goes insane, and is abandoned by him
  after he goes to live with the Indians, leaving her free to
  "marry" Captain Ahab (Una never really "marries" anybody but of
  course nobody ever criticizes). Things don't get more realistic
  in the second half, which includes Una's clever and successful
  investment in the crazy newfangled idea of obtaining oil from the
  ground instead of from a whale. Riiiight. THE MARY SUE: However,
  the absolute worst thing about this novel is the fact that it is
  a "Mary Sue" that peculiarity of fan fiction in which a laughably
  idealized and practically perfect in every way alter ego of the
  author fulfills some basic psychological need while inducing a
  combination of anger and nausea in the reader. A more realistic
  main character might have saved it. Una never learns anything
  from her life's too-many-to-be-believed experiences because she
  already knows everything. She doesn't change because she is
  already perfect. She doesn't have to deal with the criticism of
  others because she doesn't receive any, and she doesn't have to
  beg the forgiveness of those she has wronged because they forgive
  her so easily and besides, Una had her reasons (and they were
  very good ones you can be sure). The only thing I can figure is
  that her publisher approved this book on concept alone WITHOUT
  anyone ever reading it. I feel like I've just waded through the
  inept scribbling of a delusional teenage girl who insists on
  rereading Moby Dick in her bedroom... with the door
  locked.</Text>
  <Text category="book">This is a book meant to be enjoyed by children
  under the age of 10. Young teens and adult readers will be
  disapointed. Wish I never wasted the time of day reading it. Glad
  it was borrowed from the library and not purchased or I'd demand
  my money back</Text>
  <Text category="book">I got this as both a book and an audio file. I
  had waited to read it and was surprised by both the enthusiasm of
  the content and its author, but also by how he snuck in some odd
  biblically unsound thoughts (e.g., I gasped when he suggested
  Christ went to Hell...what Bible passage evidences this?). I
  agree with how he suggests the enemy is out to deceive us and
  keep us asleep...but wonder if I go further how much more
  Eldredge will slip in of his own peculiar biblical
  misintrepretations. Where were his editors when this was being
  written? Why take sensible good sections and mar them with
  oddities? I havent read all the reviews here but as one of those
  "conservatives" frequently mentioned in them I have to admit I
  may not even finish this book for fear of what else Eldredge has
  slipped up on. I did appreciate his story about Daniel and the
  "delayed" angel...but am left wondering if I need go deeper into
  researching that as possible misintepretation too. What a shame
  this book is turning into such a questionable venture for me. We
  are at war as the author suggests and we must guard the source
  material well..the Bible well. So far...I may join others and
  ditch this valiant attempt to energize Christians and return to
  the Word itself. I wonder if I can get a refund</Text>
  <Text category="book">Do you like romance novels? Do you call your
  dogs your babies? This is the book for you. The thriller aspect
  of this book is far overshadowed by the romance portion, and the
  annoyingly repetitious mentioning of the dog could possibly drive
  most readers over the edge. This was my first Johansen novel, and
  it most certainly will be my last. Two stars for actually
  wrapping up the story without leaving too many loose ends.</Text>
  <Text category="book">After reading A Fine Balance I couldn't wait
  to read another book by this author. I then read his third book
  called Family Matters which was good but I was disappointed as it
  by no means compared to A Fine Balance. I just finished Such A
  Long Journey and found it to be okay but very slow moving and
  downright boring in some spots. It is my least favorite of the
  three books by this author. It's hard to believe that someone can
  right a book like A Fine Balance, which was magnificant and one
  of the best books I have ever read, and then turn our stuff that
  is, at best, average.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I purchased this for my daughters 2nd
  birthday. Withing the first 5 minutes the back of the chair part
  for the high chair had broken off and would not stay on. The
  first time she went to take it in the bath Pooh's arm came off
  and will not go back on. I am just really disappointed that it
  wasn't anything as great as I thought it would be. I saw the it
  in the store and was excited that my daughter would love it, but
  sadly it was very depressing for both of us</Text>
  <Text category="music">I'm a big fan of Great Big Sea and I purchase
  everything they release. Apparently they were trying to give this
  CD the "feel" of a live, medium-size venue performance. Unlike
  their other live DC offerings, this one sounds like it was
  recorded with a micro-cassette tape in some fan's front pocket.
  It doesn't give justice to their usual great vocals and unique
  sound. Overall, I was pretty disappointed and I'd recommend their
  earlier offerings over this one.</Text>
  <Text category="health">The fine print on the box tells you this is a
  "multi-terrain" vehicle, instead of an "all terrain" vehicle,
  this is because while they advertise it to go through sand, and
  grass, and mud, what they actually mean is that it will go
  through dry sand, such as you would find in a desert, dry grass,
  such as you would find on the african savannah, and dry mud, such
  as you would find in their fertile imagination. Mine has shorted
  out and stopped working just going through dewey grass.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">With so much talent on show here you would
  expect a lot better movie, but this is another case of the
  scriptwriters letting the movie down. Matthew McConaughey
  delivers another good performance, yet doesn't stray too far from
  what he knows best. There is Bradley Cooper as his best friend
  who you will remember as Rachel McAdams fiance in wedding
  crashers. Patton Oswalt appears in a blink and you'll miss him
  scene, but the heros of the day are Kathy Bates and Zooey
  Deschanel who's roles are a lot more important than the
  characters they play. Bates is great as McConaughey's mother
  while Zooey is at her sarcastic best as Parker's flatmate. Parker
  should stick to television, she is dreadful and totally
  unconvincing in her role, maybe if they had cast someone else in
  her place there may have been a chance for this movie. A good
  date movie flick, the story is predictable but I would have been
  willing to look past that had I been entertained. Special
  features are nothing too special. A trailer and a few dodgy
  featurette's. A rainy night rental movie</Text>
  <Text category="health">The slippers look nice and smell great. They
  were difficult for me to get on my feet. The lining was too
  restrictive. Once they were on, they were very awkward and

  aromatherapy</Text>
  <Text category="book">There are just too many errors ,of
  interpretation,omission and commission,in this book to justify
  purchasing it.In this review we will concentrate on
  Rima's(R)handling of the work of J M Keynes.On p.84,R's claim
  that the Physiocratic concept of hoarding is
  &amp;amp;quot;surprisingly suggestive&amp;amp;quot; of J M
  Keynes's idea has no supporting evidence to back it up.On p.133,R
  claims that Malthus had developed a principle of effective
  demand,a la Keynes.What Malthus expressed was an uneasy feeling
  and/or intuition that Ricardo's deductive,analytical system of
  market self adjustment to a global optimum was overlooking(or
  assuming away)the possibility of insufficient aggregate
  spending.Nowhere does Malthus ever systematically present a
  theoretical counter to Ricardo.What Malthus does is express some
  reservations in an exchange of postal letters with Ricardo.In
  chapter 20 of R's book, she attempts to deal with Keynes's theory
  of effective demand and Keynes's discussion of involuntary
  unemployment which follows directly from his theory.Keynes worked
  out the mathematical details in his chapter 20,titled
  &amp;amp;quot;The Employment Function&amp;amp;quot;.R should have
  simply reprinted that chapter in her book,replacing her chapter
  20 with Keynes's chapter 20.R's Figure 20.1,discussed on
  pages451-454,directly contradicts Keynes's analysis</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">The batmobile itself is nice and stylish for a
  boy who adores batman. But this same boy gets extremely
  frustrated trying to shoot the coin shaped projectile that it
  comes with. You have to insert it "just-so" to get it to shoot
  when you press the button and my son doesn't always do it, then I
  have to get a butter knife and pry it out so I can put it in for
  him. For 10 dollars it's worth it, so long as your child doesn't
  absolutely want a shooting batmobile. PS. My sister bought the
  same one for her son this Christmas and is having the same
  problem, so I do not think it is unique to mine</Text>
  <Text category="book">This is a nearly verbatim rendition of the
  Grimms' story, and it's hard to understand why Zelinsky would use
  his talent to illustrate it for children. Even harder to figure
  out is how the American Library Association could award its
  Caldecott Medal for distinguished American picture book for
  children to any rendition of this dreadful tale: The king
  threatens to kill the miller's daughter if she can't spin gold
  from straw. Rumpelstiltskin saves her life by spinning gold for
  her, but extracts a necklace, a ring and, on the third night of
  spinning, a promise of her firstborn. She then marries the king,
  whom Zelinsky depicts as young and handsome. When it comes time
  for the queen to hand over her newborn, Rumpel agrees to relent
  if the queen can discover his name. She sends a servant to follow
  him into the woods and discover the name. So the king, though he
  looks good, is greedy and brutal. The queen is a victim who
  agrees to give over a future infant to save her own life, and
  then depends on an anonymous, unrecognized "servant girl" to save
  the child. And Rumpelstiltskin, shown as physically unattractive
  and (the message seems to be) therefore bad, is the one who saved
  the future queen from execution and then relents on the payment
  he bargained for. A weird, twisted story that offers nothing for
  kids, illustrated with Renaissance-style pictures that accentuate
  the perversity by making the bad guy look good and the guy who
  saved the damsel in distress look bad</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This DVD is not Shaolin Idiot but an older
  film of Stephen Chow. It's really a film called "Look Out,

  Officer" you should buy this DVD if not, don't.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">It's an interesting approach at what people
  will do for money. Still, I hated it. John Travolta was terrible
  [as usual]. Lisa Kudrow, who was the reason I watched this, was
  so incredibly unlike her role on "Friends" as she was a murderous
  goldigging nympho-biatch who made you mad every time she was on
  screen. I was very disappointed with her performance. I can't
  believe this hilarious comedic actress went for such a ... part.
  The other supporting actors were no good either with the
  exception of Bill Pullman, who was pretty funny as the "I could
  give a damn about it" cop. The best thing about this movie
  though, is the cute, gullible waitress named Wendy who's only on
  screen about five minutes throughout the entire film. Anyway,
  skip this one. It was just plain awful</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This was a real let down for my daughter. She
  loves horses and has several Breyer horses. When we saw this

  breaks easily. She spent more time trying to fix it than actually
  playing with it. After a couple of weeks it was just completely
  not worth the effort and we put it up but later threw it away,
  only the doll and horses were salvagable</Text>
  <Text category="book">I have several dummies books, from how to
  build a PC to CCNA. I had to read this rediculous book when I
  worked for a very well known DSL provider on the East Coast. This
  book was trivial, assumes that you are completely mindless and
  plugs certain products and services shamelessly. Yes, I agree,
  Hot Bot is a pretty good search engine...but it is not the only
  one out there. This book has technical incosistansies throughout
  and is basically a really really long advertisement. Easily the
  worst dummies book in print, and Im not being a jerk, I love
  dummies books, Ron Gilster rocks, but this is absolute crap. You
  can honestly get more informed with a magazine</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I found this movie to be almost unwatchable.
  If your idea of a good time is watching Henry Gibson trying to
  sing while the camera takes long pans over dull crowd scenes,
  then this movie is for you. The three minutes of excitement near
  the end barely has anything to do with anything that preceeded
  it. Altman can pull off such greats as "Mash" and "Godsford Park"
  and then stink up the joint with this. What's up with that</Text>

  <Text category="toys_games">I bought these skates for my almost 3 yr old

  They are easy enough to put on and take off. The padding inside
  is nice. The only drawback I can find is the the adjustment lever
  that keeps the wheels from rolling on setting 1 changes by itself
  to setting 2 which lets the wheels roll. I am not sure if I just
  got a bad pair or if this happens with all of these kinds of
  skates. I will keep them but it does get to be a hassle to have
  to keep putting them on the correct setting.</Text>
